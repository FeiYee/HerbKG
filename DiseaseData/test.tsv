2	ZPDC glycoprotein (24 kDa) induces apoptosis and enhances activity of NK cells in N-nitrosodiethylamine-injected Balb/c.Natural killer (NK) cells have anti-tumor activity in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using secreting granules and cytotoxic ability. Recently, we isolated glycoprotein from Zanthoxylum piperitum DC (ZPDC) has anti-oxidant effect and anti-cancer effect. The objective of this study was to determine whether ZPDC glycoprotein enhances activity of NK cells and induces apoptosis of liver cancer cells in diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-treated Balb/c mice. This study evaluated the secreting of perforin and granzyme B and cytotoxicity of NK cells, interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-12, apoptosis-related factors (bid, cytochrome c, and caspase-3) in liver tissue using Immunoblot and ELISA. The results demonstrated that ZPDC glycoprotein (20mg/kg, BW) induces secretion of perforin and granzyme B and NK cells activity. Also, it induces expression of apoptosis-related factors (bid, cytochrome c, and caspase-3) in liver tissues. Collectively, ZPDC glycoprotein may have potential applications to prevent hepatocarcinogenesis without immunosuppression. 	zanthoxylum piperitum liver cancer
2	In vitro anti-Helicobacter pylori action of 30 Chinese herbal medicines used to treat ulcer diseases.Infection by Helicobacter pylori has been ascertained to be an important etiologic impetus leading usually to chronic active gastritis and gastric ulcer with growing incidences worldwide. Utilizing as the test pathogen a standard and five clinic strains of Helicobacter pylori, the antibacterial action was assessed in vitro with ethanol extracts of 30 Chinese herbal medicines which have been frequently prescribed since ancient times for treating gastritis-like disorders. Among the 30 tested materials, the ethanol extracts of Abrus cantoniensis (Fabaceae), Saussurea lappa (Asteraceae) and Eugenia caryophyllata (Myrtaceae) were strongly inhibitory to all test strains (MICs: approximately 40 microg/ml), and Hippophae rhamnoides (Elaeagnaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii (Liliaceae), Magnolia officinalis and Schisandra chinensis (Magnoliaceae), Corydalis yanhusuo (Papaveraceae), Citrus reticulata (Rutaceae), Bupleurum chinense and Ligusticum chuanxiong (Apiaceae) substantially active with MICs close to 60.0 microg/ml. As to antibacterial actions of the aqueous extracts of the same drugs, those derived from Cassia obtusifolia (Fabaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii and Eugenia caryophyllata were remarkably inhibitory against all the six Helicobacter pylori strains (MICs: approximately 60 microg/ml). The work compared almost quantitatively the magnitude of the anti-Helicobacter pylori actions of the 30 most prescribed gastritis-treating Chinese herbal drugs, and located as well some source plants where potent anti-Helicobacter pylori phytochemicals could be characterized.	ligusticum chuanxiong gastric ulcer
1	Topical antiinflammatory activity of the major lipophilic constituents of the rhizome of Zingiber cassumunar. Part I: The essential oil.The essential oil of the rhizome of Zingiber cassumunar was found to exhibit a topical antiinflammatory effect, when tested using the model of carrageenan-induced hind paw edema in rats (ID(50) = 22 mg oil/paw). Individual assessment of topical antiinflammatory activity of the five major components of the oil demonstrated that (E)-1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)butadiene (DMPBD), terpinen-4-ol and alpha-terpinene significantly inhibited edema formation, whereas sabinene and gamma-terpinene were inactive up to 6 mg/paw. The most active compound, DMPBD, was found to be an antiinflammatory agent twice as potent as the reference drug diclofenac (ID(50) = 3 vs 6 mg/paw, respectively).	zingiber cassumunar sabinene
3	Bioactivity-Oriented Purification of Polyphenols from Cinnamomum cassia Presl. with Anti-Proliferation Effects on Colorectal Cancer Cells.Cinnamomum cassia Presl. (CCP) is a popular natural spice possessing various pharmacological properties. We obtained polyphenol-rich fraction (CCP-P) from CCP by bioactivity-oriented purification method and evaluated its Wnt signaling inhibition activity. Firstly, the phenolic components were identified as the main bioactive compounds with anti-colorectal cancer activity. Then, we compared the anti-colorectal cancer activity of CCP extract obtained from different solvent by cell morphology alteration and EdU assay. Ethanol extract showed higher antiproliferative activity compared to water extract on HCT116 cells, with proliferating cells reducing to 41.12 and 21.83% at 156.00 mug GAE/mL, respectively. Next, separation and enrichment of polyphenols from ethanol extract was performed on AB-8 macroporous resins under optimal conditions. Further evaluation of the CCP-P bioactivity revealed that it exerted more potent antiproliferative activity on RKO and HCT116 cells, showing higher selectivity for Wnt-dependent colorectal cancer cells (CRCs). Ten major polyphenols were identified in the CCP-P by UPLC-ESI-MS/MS. In summary, this study presents evidence that CCP-derived polyphenols are promising potential candidates as functional food ingredients against CRC.	polyphenols colorectal cancer
1	Bioefficacy of essential and vegetable oils of Zanthoxylum xanthoxyloides seeds against Acanthoscelides obtectus (Say) (Coleoptera: Bruchidae).Experiments were conducted in the laboratory to evaluate the bioefficacy of essential and vegetable oils of Zanthoxylum xanthoxyloides (Rutaceae) against Acanthoscelides obtectus (Coleoptera: Bruchidae). The chemical composition of the essential oil and the fatty acid composition of the vegetable oil extracted from the seeds of Z. xanthoxyloides were determined. The insecticidal activities of these oils and the associated aromatized clay powder were evaluated against A. obtectus. Both oils were strongly repellent (100% repellency at 0.501 mul/cm2 essential oil and 3.144 mul/cm2 vegetable oil) and highly toxic (LC50 = 0.118 mul/cm2 for essential oil) to this beetle after contact on filter paper. The vapors of the essential oil were highly toxic to adult insects (LC50 = 0.044 mul/cm3), and the aromatized powder made from clay and essential oil was more toxic (LD50 = 0.137 mul/g) than the essential oil alone (LD50 = 0.193 mul/g) after 2 days of exposure on a common bean. Both oils greatly reduced the F1 insect production and bean weight loss and did not adversely affect the bean seed viability. In general, the results obtained indicate that these plant oils can be used for control of A. obtectus in stored beans.	a. obtectus fatty acid
1	Cassia cinnamon as a source of coumarin in cinnamon-flavored food and food supplements in the United States.Coumarin as an additive or as a constituent of tonka beans or tonka extracts is banned from food in the United States due to its potentially adverse side effects. However, coumarin in food from other natural ingredients is not regulated. "True Cinnamon" refers to the dried inner bark of Cinnamomum verum. Other cinnamon species, C. cassia, C. loureiroi, and C. burmannii, commonly known as cassia, are also sold in the U.S. as cinnamon. In the present study, coumarin and other marker compounds were analyzed in authenticated cinnamon bark samples as well as locally bought cinnamon samples, cinnamon-flavored foods, and cinnamon-based food supplements using a validated UPLC-UV/MS method. The experimental results indicated that C. verum bark contained only traces of coumarin, whereas barks from all three cassia species, especially C. loureiroi and C. burmannii, contained substantial amounts of coumarin. These species could be potential sources of coumarin in cinnamon-flavored food in the U.S. Coumarin was detected in all locally bought cinnamon, cinnamon-flavored foods, and cinnamon food supplements. Their chemical profiles indicated that the cinnamon samples and the cinnamon in food supplements and flavored foods were probably Indonesian cassia, C. burmannii.	cinnamon Coumarin

1	Network pharmacology-based research uncovers cold resistance and thermogenesis mechanism of Cinnamomum cassia.BACKGROUND: Cinnamomum cassia (L.) J.Presl (Cinnamon) was known as a kind of hot herb, improved circulation and warmed the body. However, the active components and mechanisms of dispelling cold remain unknown. METHODS: The effects of several Chinses herbs on thermogenesis were evaluated on body temperature and activation of brown adipose tissue. After confirming the effect, the components of cinnamon were identified using HPLC-Q-TOF/MS and screened with databases. The targets of components were obtained with TCMSP, SymMap, Swiss and STITCH databases. Thermogenesis genes were predicted with DisGeNET and GeneCards databases. The protein-protein interaction network was constructed with Cytoscape 3.7.1 software. GO enrichment analysis was accomplished with STRING databases. KEGG pathway analysis was established with Omicshare tools. The top 20 targets for four compounds were obtained according to the number of edges of PPI network. In addition, the network results were verified with experimental research for the effects of extracts and major compounds. RESULTS: Cinnamon extract significantly upregulated the body temperature during cold exposure.121 components were identified in HPLC-Q-TOF/MS. Among them, 60 compounds were included in the databases. 116 targets were obtained for the compounds, and 41 genes were related to thermogenesis. The network results revealed that 27 active ingredients and 39 target genes. Through the KEGG analysis, the top 3 pathways were PPAR signaling pathway, AMPK signaling pathway, thermogenesis pathway. The thermogenic protein PPARgamma, UCP1 and PGC1-alpha was included in the critical targets of four major compounds. The three major compounds increased the lipid consumption and activated the brown adipocyte. They also upregulated the expression of UCP1, PGC1-alpha and pHSL, especially 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde was confirmed the effect for the first time. Furthermore, cinnamaldehyde and cinnamon activated the expression of TRPA1 on DRG cells. CONCLUSION: The mechanisms of cinnamon on cold resistance were investigated with network pharmacology and experiment validation. This work provided research direction to support the traditional applications of thermogenesis.	cinnamon cinnamaldehyde
2	Bioactive components in the fruits of Ziziphus jujuba Mill. against the inflammatory irritant action of Euphorbia plants.Chinese jujube (also known as Chinese date) is the fruit of Ziziphus jujuba Mill. (Rhamnaceae). As a famous folk medicine, it is used as antidote in traditional Chinese formula, Shi Zao Decoction, to relieve the drastic inflammatory irritant nature of Euphorbia species. The irritant activities may cause serious adverse effects in clinical practices. This study aimed to investigate the active components of Z. jujuba through the inhibitory effects on the inflammatory cells activated by Euphorbia kansui and prostratin, a phorbol ester isolated from Euphorbia fischeriana. Peritoneal macrophage of rat and splenic lymphocyte (splenocyte) of mouse were selected to evaluate these actions in vitro. Nitric oxide (NO) release of macrophage and the proliferation of splenocyte were examined through Griess method and MTT assay. TNF-alpha, as an important pro-inflammatory cytokines, was detected with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Six fractions extracted from Z. jujuba were evaluated and fraction F (triterpene acids fraction) was demonstrated to be the most active part, and then, 21 compounds isolated from Z. jujuba were tested at the concentrations range from 1 mug/ml to 100 mug/ml. The results show that 7 compounds of them are likely to be active compounds concerning to their pronounced inhibitory action on the activated inflammatory cells. These effects might be helpful to attenuate the irritant action of Euphorbiaceae plants and protect the gastrointestinal tissue from potent inflammatory injury, which should be beneficial to some diseases, like inflammatory bowel disease.	z. jujuba inflammatory injury
2	The extract of Cinnamomum cassia twigs inhibits adipocyte differentiation via activation of the insulin signaling pathway in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes.CONTEXT: Obesity is associated with a number of diseases with metabolic abnormalities such as type 2 diabetes (T2D). Medicinal plants have been widely used for the treatment of obesity and related complications. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated the antidiabetic properties of the extract of twigs of Cinnamomum cassia Blume (Lauraceae) (Cinnamomi Ramulus; CR) in 3T3-L1 murine preadipocytes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated into adipocytes for 3 d in insulin-conditioned medium and then treated with CR extract at concentrations of 100 and 500 mug/mL for 6 d. Adipocyte differentiation was measured by Oil Red O staining, and the expression of master transcription factors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-alpha (C/EBPalpha), and sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), and lipid metabolism factors were investigated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/insulin signaling pathway was assessed by western blot analysis. RESULTS: CR extract significantly reduced lipid accumulation and down-regulated the expression of PPARgamma, C/EBPalpha, and SREBP-1c in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. CR extract also suppressed the expression of fatty acid synthase (FAS), acyl-CoA synthase, and perilipin. Moreover, CR extract markedly up-regulated the phosphorylation of AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). In addition, CR extract effectively increased the expression levels of glucose transporter-4 (GLUT-4), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: These results suggest that CR extract may have therapeutic potential as a natural agent for the improvement of T2D via regulation of the insulin-dependent signaling pathway.	cinnamomum cassia type 2 diabetes

1	Methylxanthines reversibly inhibit tracheary-element differentiation in suspension cultures of Zinnia elegans L.Tracheary-element (TE) differentiation in suspension-cultured mesophyll cells of Zinnia elegans L. was completely inhibited by caffeine and theophylline only when these methylxanthines were applied at least 8 h prior to the appearance of secondary cell-wall thickenings. In contrast, the calcium-channel blocker nifedipine completely inhibited TE differentiation when applied only 2-3 h prior to the onset of secondary cell-wall deposition. This indicates the involvement of a methylxanthine-inhibitable event in TE differentiation that is distinguishable from an event dependent on influx of extracellular calcium. The correlation between the time of appearance of chlorotetracycline fluorescence (an indicator of sequestered Ca(2+)) and loss of methylxanthine effectiveness indicates that inhibition by methylxanthines may result from release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores. Methylxanthines with high potencies against adenosine 3' : 5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) phosphodiesterase and adenosine receptors were less effective inhibitors of TE differentiation, indicating that inhibition of differentiation by methylxanthines is independent of cAMP metabolism. The role of cAMP in transduction of the cytokinin signal, which was proposed previously on the basis of stimulation of TE differentiation by theophylline, was investigated using the non-hydrolyzable analog 8-bromo-cAMP. Although 8-bromo-cAMP stimulated differentiation in the absence of inductive concentrations of cytokinin, the non-cyclic analog 8-bromo-AMP was even more effective, indicating that 8-bromo-cAMP behaves as a cytokinin analog, rather than a second messenger, in stimulating TE differentiation. 	zinnia elegans caffeine
1	Optimization of subcritical extraction process for cinnamon (Cinnamomum Cassia Blume) using response surface methodology.Subcritical extraction was optimized to maximize the extraction yield of flavoring compounds from cinnamon. The extracts of cinnamon were obtained at three different levels of extraction temperature (110-130  C), time (20-60 min), and pressure (20-40 bar). Response surface methodology was used in order to optimize the subcritical extraction process. The suitability of each independent variable in the second-order polynomial regression model was evaluated on the extraction yield and flavoring compound contents. For optimum extraction yield, the optimum temperature, time, and pressure were determined as 130  C, 60 min, and 26.63 bar, respectively. The contents of the flavoring compound predicted at optimum conditions were as follows: 10.01 mg/g at 110  C, 20 min, and 20 bar for coumarin; 4.95 mg/g at 110  C, 20 min, and 32 bar for cinnamic acid; 55 mg/g at 110  C, 34.62 min, and 37 bar for cinnamldehyde; and 4.92 mg/g at 110.9  C, 20 min, and 20 bar for cinnamyl alcohol.	cinnamomum cassia coumarin
1	Pharmacognostical and phytochemical evaluation of the leaves of Ziziphus xylopyrus (Retz) Willd.BACKGROUND: The fruit decoction of Ziziphus xylopyrus (Retz) Willd. is used toward increase sterility in woman intended birth control in some parts of Rajasthan, India. This plant is widely used in Turkish medicines as a potent sedative. One to two inches of the fresh stem bark of this species are chewed with 1-2 peppers, and the sap swallowed once a day for 5 days in the treatment of cough. Standardization is one of the challenges in herbal medicine. It is essential to evaluate the herbal plants scientifically and proper documentation should be made to know their medicinal properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Leaf samples of Z. xylopyrus were studied as recommended by World Health Organization for morphological, microscopic, physicochemical, phytochemical, powder characteristics and other methods for standardization. RESULTS: Morphologically the leaves are obovate or orbicular in shape, pinnate venation having aromatic odour and pungent taste. Microscopically leaves showed the presence of ground tissue, vascular strand, xylem and phloem. The crystals are mostly rosette type. Microscopic examination of powder showed the presence of stomata, covering trichomes, sclerenchyma, collenchyma, epidermal cells and vascular strands. Phytochemical screening of the plant part with various solvents revealed the presence of alkaloids, carbohydrates, steroids and sterol, glycosides, saponins, flavonoids, phenolic compounds, triterpenoids in it. Physicochemical parameters such as ash value extractive values were also determined and results showed that water soluble extractive value to be higher than alcohol soluble extractive value. CONCLUSION: Results may be helpful for further confirmation of selected species and in future these characters may be compared with the new batch of the same plant materials.	ziziphus xylopyrus saponins
2	Antioxidative effects of Cinnamomi cassiae and Rhodiola rosea extracts in liver of diabetic mice.Both Cinnamomi cassiae and Rhodiola rosea extracts are used as anti-diabetic folk medicines. Recently, increased oxidative stress was shown to play an important role in the etiology and pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus and its complications. This study was designed to examine the effects of Cinnamomi cassiae and Rhodiola rosea extracts on blood glucose, lipid peroxidation, the level of reduced glutathione and its related enzymes (glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase), and the activity of the antioxidant enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase) in the liver of db/db mice. Diabetic C57BL/Ks db/db mice were used as experimental models. Mice were divided into control (n=10), Cinnamomi cassiae (200 mg/kg/day, n=10), and Rhodiola rosea (200 mg/kg/day, n=10) treated groups for 12 weeks of treatment. These type II diabetic mice were used to investigate the effects of Cinnamomi cassiae and Rhodiola rosea on blood glucose, reduced glutathione, glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase, lipid peroxidation, catalase and superoxide dismutase. Cinnamomi cassiae and Rhodiola rosea extracts significantly decreased on blood glucose, increased levels of reduced glutathione and the activities of glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase in the liver. Extract treatment also significantly decreased lipid peroxidation. Cinnamomi cassiae and Rhodiola rosea extracts may be effective for correcting hyperglycemia and preventing diabetic complications.	cinnamomi cassiae hyperglycemia
2	In vivo effect of some home spices extracts on the toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites.Toxoplasmosis drugs have the longest history and are still the first choice for most conditions. Alternative drugs such as Co-trimoxazole and Tetracycline have been tried and acclaimed successful. The lack of general acceptance, however, is an indication that the results are not very convincing. A wide range of antibiotics is urgently needed for patients with drug reaction or resistance problems. The anti-toxoplasmic activity of water and ethanol extracts as well as the oil of some home spices (Piper nigrum, Capsicum frutescens, Cinnamomum cassia and Curcuma longa), were evaluated in murine models of intraperitoneal infection using the RH strain of Toxoplasma gondii. Female mice were infected with 2x10(2) tachyzoites/ml, and then treated intraperitoneally with the home spices at 100 and 200 mg/kg/day for seven days. The tested extracts reduced the mean number of tachyzoites present in the peritoneal fluid of the experimental mice. The most effective extract was Curcuma longa ethanol extract which showed a 98.6% and 99.2% inhibition of the growth of Toxoplasma tachyzoites in 100 and 200 doses respectively compared to the control infected untreated mice.	curcuma longa infected
3	Inhibition of human tumor growth by 2'-hydroxy- and 2'-benzoyloxycinnamaldehydes.2'-Hydroxycinnamaldehyde (HCA) was isolated from Cinnamomum cassia Blume (Lauraceae) and 2'-benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde (BCA) was prepared by the reaction of HCA and benzoyl chloride. HCA and BCA strongly inhibited in vitro growth of 29 kinds of human cancer cells and in vivo growth of SW-620 human tumor xenograft without the loss of body weight in nude mice. HCA prevented adherence of SW-620 cells to the culture surface but did not inhibit oncogenic K-Ras processing, implying its antitumor mechanisms at the cellular level.	2'-Hydroxycinnamaldehyde tumor
1	Harvesting canthinones: identification of the optimal seasonal point of harvest of Zanthoxylum chiloperone leaves as a source of 5-methoxycanthin-6-one.This article is focused on the seasonal variation in the contents of 5-methoxycanthin-6-one from the leaves of Zanthoxylum chiloperone (Rutaceae). Based on the pharmacological interest presented by 5-methoxycanthin-6-one, its seasonal variation in Z. chiloperone leaves was analysed in order to determine the best time for harvesting, optimising the 5-methoxycanthin-6-one content. The seasonal dynamics of canthinone alkaloids can be the key to improve the isolation from natural sustainable sources, such as leaves. Complementarily, this study describes the phytochemistry of leaf from this Ruraceae species. 	zanthoxylum chiloperone 5-methoxycanthin-6-one
1	Phytochemical and biological activities of four wild medicinal plants.The fruits of four wild plants, namely, Capparis decidua, Ficus carica, Syzygium cumini, and Ziziphus jujuba, are separately used as traditional dietary and remedial agents in remote areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. The results of our study on these four plants revealed that the examined fruits were a valuable source of nutraceuticals and exhibited good level of antimicrobial activity. The fruits of these four investigated plants are promising source of polyphenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, and saponins. These four plants' fruits are good sources of iron, zinc, copper, manganese, selenium, and chromium. It was also observed that these fruits are potential source of antioxidant agent and the possible reason could be that these samples had good amount of phytochemicals. Hence, the proper propagation, conservation, and chemical investigation are recommended so that these fruits should be incorporated for the eradication of food and health related problems. 	capparis decidua terpenoids
2	Evaluation of the anti-arthritic activity of Cinnamomum cassia bark extract in experimental models.Background: Cinnamomum cassia iswidely used as a traditional medicinal plant for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Objective: The present study aimed to assess the anti-arthritic activity of C. cassia bark hydroalcoholic extract (CCHE) in different arthritic animal models. Methods: In formaldehyde model, sub-plantar administration of 0.1 ml of formaldehyde (2% v/v) into the right hind paws of Wistar albino rats on days 0 and 3. The rats were divided into six groups as follows: normal control, disease control, indomethacin group (3 mg/kg, p.o.) and three groups, treated with 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg CCHE (p.o.). Joint diameter was measured, and ankle joints were collected for MDA and GSH measurements. In complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced arthritis model, CFA was injected into the sub-plantar surface of the right hind paw in rats. Joint diameter was measured, and serum TNF-alpha and IL-1beta were measured. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses were also performed. Results: CCHE treatment significantly (p &lt; 0.01) reduced MDA levels and joint swelling in a concentration-dependent manner in rats with formaldehyde-induced arthritis, in which GSH levels were elevated (p &lt; 0.01). In rats with CFA-induced arthritis, CCHE treatment significantly reduced joint swelling as well as IL-1beta and TNF-alpha levels (p &lt; 0.01). TNF-alpha receptor expression was decreased in rats treated with indomethacin or CCHE. Conclusion: Based on these findings, it can be concluded that C. cassia possesses anti-arthritic properties.	c. cassia rheumatoid arthritis
2	An unusual manifestation of Abrus precatorius poisoning: a report of two cases.Abrus precatorius seeds are highly toxic and are often ingested as a means of suicide in India. Hemorrhagic gastroenteritis with erosions, hemolysis, acute renal damage, hepatotoxicity with elevated liver enzymes, and seizures are common manifestations of toxicity. We report two cases of Abrus precatorius poisoning with raised intracranial pressure (ICP) and papilledema that have not been described earlier in literature. One patient recovered completely with conservative management to lower raised ICP while the other patient expired before effective treatment could be institutedd. The cases are being reported to propose the need for routine fundus examination and brain imaging in severe abrus poisoning with CNS toxicity, as early institution of treatment for cerebral edema measures may be life saving.	abrus precatorius hemolysis
1	Seasonal variation in the leaf essential oil composition of Zanthoxylum clava-herculis growing in Huntsville, Alabama.The seasonal variation in the chemical composition of the leaf essential oil of Zanthoxylum clava-herculis has been analyzed by GC-MS. Three individual trees were sampled four times during the course of the 2004 growing season. Notable differences were recorded in the essential oil yields from the three trees on the four collection dates; yields were highest in May and lowest in July. The leaf essential oils were made up of 25 components, largely menthane monoterpenoids, dominated by limonene (44-73%) and 1,8-cineole (16-43%), with lesser amounts of alpha-thujene, linalool, gamma-terpinene, and alpha-terpineol. The ratio of oxygenated monoterpenoids to monoterpene hydrocarbons generally increased during the season, largely reflected in the 1,8-cineole/limonene ratio.	zanthoxylum clava-herculis monoterpenoids
1	Bioinformatic and functional characterization of the basic peroxidase 72 from Arabidopsis thaliana involved in lignin biosynthesis.Lignins result from the oxidative polymerization of three hydroxycinnamyl (p-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl) alcohols in a reaction mediated by peroxidases. The most important of these is the cationic peroxidase from Zinnia elegans (ZePrx), an enzyme considered to be responsible for the last step of lignification in this plant. Bibliographical evidence indicates that the arabidopsis peroxidase 72 (AtPrx72), which is homolog to ZePrx, could have an important role in lignification. For this reason, we performed a bioinformatic, histochemical, photosynthetic, and phenotypical and lignin composition analysis of an arabidopsis knock-out mutant of AtPrx72 with the aim of characterizing the effects that occurred due to the absence of expression of this peroxidase from the aspects of plant physiology such as vascular development, lignification, and photosynthesis. In silico analyses indicated a high homology between AtPrx72 and ZePrx, cell wall localization and probably optimal levels of translation of AtPrx72. The histochemical study revealed a low content in syringyl units and a decrease in the amount of lignin in the atprx72 mutant plants compared to WT. The atprx72 mutant plants grew more slowly than WT plants, with both smaller rosette and principal stem, and with fewer branches and siliques than the WT plants. Lastly, chlorophyll a fluorescence revealed a significant decrease in PhiPSII and q L in atprx72 mutant plants that could be related to changes in carbon partitioning and/or utilization of redox equivalents in arabidopsis metabolism. The results suggest an important role of AtPrx72 in lignin biosynthesis. In addition, knock-out plants were able to respond and adapt to an insufficiency of lignification.	arabidopsis lignin
3	Cinnamic acid, from the bark of Cinnamomum cassia, regulates glucose transport via activation of GLUT4 on L6 myotubes in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-independent manner.BACKGROUND: Cinnamomum cassia (Family: Lauraceae) is an Ayurvedic medicinal plant used traditionally for the treatment of a number of diseases, including diabetes. The hypoglycemic effect of this plant has been established in vivo. However, the effects of cinnamic acid, isolated from C. cassia, on the insulin signaling cascade in an in vitro model have not been elucidated. Hence, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the anti-diabetic effect of cinnamic acid on glucose transport by L6 myotubes. METHODS: The mechanism of action of cinnamic acid was determined using specific targets in the insulin signaling pathway, including protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) 1B, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) and the glucose transporter GLUT4. After differentiation of myoblast to myotubes, the cells were serum deprived for 5 h and then treated with 1 ng/mL cinnamic acid and 50 mumol/L rosiglitazone for 18 h and 100 nmol/L insulin for 20 min for gene expression studies. RESULTS: Expression of GLUT4 mRNA was increased following treatment of L6 myotubes with 1 ng/mL cinnamic acid. Furthermore, cinnamic acid inhibited PTP1B activity (by 96.5%), but had no significant effect on PI3-K activity. CONCLUSION: On the basis of the results of the present study, we postulate that cinnamic acid isolated from the hydro-alcoholic extract of Cinnamomum cassia activates glucose transport by a PI3-K-independent pathway. However, the detailed mechanism of action requires further analysis.	cinnamic acid diabetic
2	[GC-MS analysis and cytotoxic activity of the supercritical extracts from roots and stems of Zanthoxylum nitidum].The volatile components of roots and stems of Zanthoxylum nitidum were investigated by supercritical fluid carbon dioxide extraction (SFE-CO2) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry(GC-MS). Thirty-one and fifty-one compounds were identified in the supercritical extracts from roots and stems of Z. nitidum, respectively, and total twenty-seven compounds were the common constituents. Among them, the major constituents in root and stem supercritical extracts were spathulenol (18.49 and 26.18%), n-hexadecanoic acid (14.24% and 12.79%), ar-tumerone (6.95% and 8.88%), oleic acid (8.39% and 5.71%) and hexanoic acid (4.39% and 7.78%). The in-vitro MTT assay showed that the volatile components of roots and stems of Z. nitidum did not exhibited any cytotoxic activity against human cancer Huh-7 and normal IEC-6 cells. These results indicated the same nature of the volatile constituents in the root and stem of Z. nitidum. This investigation may provide further evidence for expansion of medicinal parts of Z. nitidum.	z. nitidum cancer
2	Algorithm for complementary and alternative medicine practice and research in type 2 diabetes.OBJECTIVE: To develop a model to direct the prescription of nutritional and botanical medicines in the treatment of type 2 diabetes for both clinical and research purposes. METHODS: Available literature on nutritional and botanical medicines was reviewed and categorized as follows: antioxidant/anti-inflammatory; insulin sensitizer; and beta-cell protectant/insulin secretagogue. Literature describing laboratory assessment for glycemic control, insulin resistance, and beta-cell reserve was also reviewed and a clinical decision tree was developed. RESULTS: Clinical algorithms were created to guide the use of nutritional and botanic medicines using validated laboratory measures of glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, and beta-cell reserve. Nutrient and botanic medicines with clinical trial research support include coenzyme Q10, carnitine, alpha-lipoic acid, N-acetylcysteine, vitamin D, vitamin C, vitamin E, chromium, vanadium, omega-3 fatty acids, cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia), fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum), and gymnema (Gymnema sylvestre). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical algorithms can direct supplementation in clinical practice and provide research models for clinical investigation. Algorithms also provide a framework for integration of future evidence as it becomes available. Research funding to investigate potentially beneficial practices in complementary medicine is critically important for optimal patient care and safety.	gymnema sylvestre diabetes
3	Apoptosis induction of 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde as a proteasome inhibitor is associated with ER stress and mitochondrial perturbation in cancer cells.2'-Hydroxycinnamaldehyde (HCA), isolated from the stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia, and 2'-benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde (BCA), one of HCA derivatives, have antiproliferative activities on several human cancer cell lines. Our previous study suggested that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and caspase-3 are the major regulators of HCA-induced apoptosis. In the present study, we demonstrated a novel molecular target using in vitro pull-down assay by biotin-labeled HCA (biotin-HCA) in SW620 cells. We analyzed 11 differential spots of 2-dimensional gel prepared with pull-downed proteins by biotin-HCA. Among them, five spots were identified as proteasome subunits. An in vitro 26S proteasome function assay using specific fluorogenic substrates showed that HCA potently inhibits L3-like activity of the proteasome. In addition, HCA showed inhibitory action against chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and PGPH-like activities. DNA microarray showed that HCA induced heat shock family and ER stress-responsive genes, which reflects the accumulation of misfolded proteins by proteasome inhibition. On western blot analysis, it was confirmed that HCA induces glucose-regulated protein, 78 kDa (GRP78) and some representative endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-responsive proteins. Furthermore, HCA treatment decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. The effect of HCA on cytochrome c and Bax translocation between cytosol and mitochondrial membrane was clarified using western blot analysis. These results suggest that HCA-induced apoptosis is associated with the inhibition of the proteasome activity that leads in turn to the increase of ER stress and mitochondrial perturbation.	2'-benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde cancer
1	Network pharmacology-based research uncovers cold resistance and thermogenesis mechanism of Cinnamomum cassia.BACKGROUND: Cinnamomum cassia (L.) J.Presl (Cinnamon) was known as a kind of hot herb, improved circulation and warmed the body. However, the active components and mechanisms of dispelling cold remain unknown. METHODS: The effects of several Chinses herbs on thermogenesis were evaluated on body temperature and activation of brown adipose tissue. After confirming the effect, the components of cinnamon were identified using HPLC-Q-TOF/MS and screened with databases. The targets of components were obtained with TCMSP, SymMap, Swiss and STITCH databases. Thermogenesis genes were predicted with DisGeNET and GeneCards databases. The protein-protein interaction network was constructed with Cytoscape 3.7.1 software. GO enrichment analysis was accomplished with STRING databases. KEGG pathway analysis was established with Omicshare tools. The top 20 targets for four compounds were obtained according to the number of edges of PPI network. In addition, the network results were verified with experimental research for the effects of extracts and major compounds. RESULTS: Cinnamon extract significantly upregulated the body temperature during cold exposure.121 components were identified in HPLC-Q-TOF/MS. Among them, 60 compounds were included in the databases. 116 targets were obtained for the compounds, and 41 genes were related to thermogenesis. The network results revealed that 27 active ingredients and 39 target genes. Through the KEGG analysis, the top 3 pathways were PPAR signaling pathway, AMPK signaling pathway, thermogenesis pathway. The thermogenic protein PPARgamma, UCP1 and PGC1-alpha was included in the critical targets of four major compounds. The three major compounds increased the lipid consumption and activated the brown adipocyte. They also upregulated the expression of UCP1, PGC1-alpha and pHSL, especially 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde was confirmed the effect for the first time. Furthermore, cinnamaldehyde and cinnamon activated the expression of TRPA1 on DRG cells. CONCLUSION: The mechanisms of cinnamon on cold resistance were investigated with network pharmacology and experiment validation. This work provided research direction to support the traditional applications of thermogenesis.	cinnamon 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde
4	Trans-cinnamaldehyde improves neuroinflammation-mediated NMDA receptor dysfunction and memory deficits through blocking NF-kappaB pathway in presenilin1/2 conditional double knockout mice.A chronic neuroinflammatory response has been considered as a critical pathogenesis promoting neurodegenerative progression in Alzheimer's disease (AD). During neuroinflammatory process, microglia are excessively activated and simultaneously release numerous pro-inflammatory mediators that cause synaptic dysfunction in the forebrain prior to neuronal degeneration and memory deficits in AD. Thus, prevention of neuroinflammation-mediated synaptic dysfunction may be a potential therapeutic approach against neurodegenerative disorders. Trans-cinnamaldehyde (TCA) is a primary bioactive component derived from the stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia, and it possesses potent anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities in in vivo and in vitro experiments. However, the in-depth molecular mechanisms of TCA underlying anti-neuroinflammatory and neuroprotective effects on memory deficits in AD are still unclear. The presenilin 1 and 2 conditional double knockout (PS cDKO) mice exhibit AD-like phenotypes including obvious neuroinflammatory responses and synaptic dysfunction and memory deficits. Here, PS cDKO were used to evaluate the potential neuroprotective effects of TCA against neuroinflammation-mediated dementia by performing behavioral tests, electrophysiological recordings and molecular biology analyses. We observed that TCA treatment reversed abnormal expression of synaptic proteins and tau hyperphosphorylation in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of PS cDKO mice. TCA treatment also ameliorated NMDA receptor (NMDAR) dysfunction including impaired NMDAR-mediated responses and long-term potentiation (LTP) induction in the hippocampus of PS cDKO mice. Moreover, TCA possesses an ability to suppress neuroinflammatory responses by diminishing microglial activation and levels of pro-inflammatory mediators in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of PS cDKO mice. Importantly, improving NMDAR dysfunction and memory deficits of PS cDKO mice was due to the inhibition of neuroinflammatory responses through TCA's interruptive effect on the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway. Therefore, TCA may be a potential anti-neuroinflammatory agent for deterring neurodegenerative progression of AD.	NMDAR AD
1	[Analysis and utilization value discussion of multiple chemical composition in different tissues of Abelmoschus manihot].This research is to analyze the resourceful chemical composition in different tissues (root, stem, leaf and flower) of Abelmoschus manihot and evaluate their utilizing value. The flavonoids, soluble polysaccharides, cellulose, nucleosides and amino acids in the different tissues of A. manihot were determined by HPLC coupled with UV-Vis spectrophotpmetry, and UPLC-TQ/MS. The flowers are rich in the resourceful chemical compositions of flavonoids which mainly consist of hyperoside, isoquercitrin, cotton-8-O-glucuronide, myricetin, quercetin-3'-O-glucoside, rutin and quercetin. The total content of these flavonoids is 25.450 mg g-1 in the flowers, while they are trace in the other tissues.Different tissues of A. manihot are rich in soluble polysaccharides and celluloses and the stems have the highest content(19.76%) of soluble polysaccharides, while the roots have the highest content (29.88%) of cellulose. Total of 21 amino acids and 9 nucleosides were detected in this plant, and the flowers have the highest content of amino acids(4.737 mg g-1), while the leaves have the highest content of nucleosides (1.474 mg g-1). A. manihot is rich in the resourceful chemical compositions, and its constituents and contents are various in different tissues of this plant.The results provided a scientific basis for the utilization and industrial development of A. manihot plants.	a. manihot myricetin
1	High-performance liquid chromatography--two wavelength detection of triterpenoid acids from the fruits of Ziziphus jujuba containing various cultivars in different regions and classification using chemometric analysis.A simple and sensitive HPLC-DAD method has been developed for the first time to simultaneously determine 10 triterpenoid acids (ceanothic acid, alphitolic acid, zizyberanal acid, zizyberanalic acid, epiceanothic acid, ceanothenic acid, betulinic acid, oleanolic acid, ursonic acid and zizyberenalic acid) in the dried fruit of Ziziphus jujuba (called Dazao) which has been widely used as one of the traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs). This HPLC assay was performed on a reversed-phase C(18) column (250 mm x 4.6mm, 5 microm) with the column temperature at 35 degrees C. The mobile phase was composed of A (acetonitrile) and B (0.05% aqueous phosphoric acid, v/v). The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min and the detection wave length was set at 205 nm for reference compounds 1-9 and 238 nm for reference compound 10. All calibration curves showed good linear regression (r(2)&gt;0.9999) within the test range. The established method showed good precision and accuracy with overall intra-day and inter-day variations of 0.43-1.72% and 0.53-2.45%, respectively, and overall recoveries of 94.98-104.09% for the 10 compounds analyzed. The validated method was successfully applied for the simultaneous determination of the 10 triterpenoid acids in 42 batches of Dazao which contained 36 cultivars from 22 cultivation regions, and were investigated and authenticated as Z. jujuba. Hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) and principal components analysis (PCA) were performed to differentiate and classify the samples based on the contents of the 10 triterpenoid acids. The presented HPLC-DAD method conjugated with chemometrics approach was demonstrated to be very helpful in using Dazao resources, and was possibly useful in chemotaxonomic characterization.	z. jujuba zizyberanal acid
4	2'-Hydroxycinnamaldehyde targets low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 to inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced microglial activation.2'-Hydroxycinnamaldehyde (HCA) isolated from the stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia and its derivative 2'-benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde (BCA) were reported to have anti-angiogenic, anti-proliferative, and anti-inflammatory effects in several human cancer cells and RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. However, effects of HCA/BCA on the neuroinflammation have not been investigated. In the present study, a potential anti-neuroinflammatory effect of HCA/BCA was assessed in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated microglial cultures and microglia/neuroblastoma cocultures. Nitric oxide production, inflammatory gene expression, and signaling pathways were investigated. HCA/BCA significantly decreased the production of nitric oxide and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in microglial cells. HCA/BCA also attenuated the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and TNF-alpha at mRNA level via blockade of ERK, JNK, p38 MAPK, and NF-kappaB activation. Moreover, HCA/BCA was neuroprotective by reducing microglia-mediated neuroblastoma cell death in a microglia-neuroblastoma co-culture. Affinity chromatography and LC-MS/MS analysis identified low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) as a potential molecular target of HCA in microglial cells. Based on the studies using the receptor-associated protein (RAP) that blocks a ligand binding to LRP1 and the siRNA-mediated LRP1 gene silencing, we were able to conclude that HCA inhibited LPS-induced microglial activation via LRP1. Our results suggest that HCA/BCA be anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective in the CNS by targeting LRP1, and may have a therapeutic potential against neuroinflammatory diseases.

2	Antiproliferative and anticarcinogenic effects of an aqueous preparation of Abies alba and Viscum album se abies, on a L-1210 malignant cell line and tumor-bearing Wistar rats.Extracts of plants have been widely tested for possible anticarcinogenic properties. In the present study a traditional remedy, consisting of an aqueous extract of mixed parts of the tree Abies alba and its mistletoe Viscum album se abies was tested on benzo(alpha)pyrene(BaP)-induced tumors in Wistar rats and on the L-1210 malignant cell line. Two main groups of male Wistar rats subcutaneously injected by 10 mg of BaP, a dose inducing 100% carcinogenesis, a control group (C-G, 15 rats) and a treatment group(TR-G, 18 rats), were used for the study. Five animals bearing BaP-induced tumors were also tested (TR-1-G). Animals of the TR-G were orally administered with the aqueous extract at doses of 50 ml/kg b.w, from the day of BaP injection and of the TR-1-G, from the 120th day of injection, till death. L-1210 malignant cells in cultivation, were administered with a powder obtained by condensation and lyophilization of the extract, at various concentrations and cytotoxicity was measured by the microculture tetrazolium assay. Autopsy of the rats, revealed metastasis in the lungs of the animals of all groups and the tumors developed were histologically identified as leiomyosarcomas. The results indicated that the extract of the above plants possess anticarcinogenic effects, documented by: a) its antiproliferative effects on L-1210 cells (IC50 = 49.6 +/- 1.4 micrograms/ml), b) the significant prolongation of life and reduction of tumor growth rate of the animals of the TR-G in comparison to the C-G, c) the inhibition by 16.6% of tumor induction in the TR-G and d) the prolongation of life and the necrotic effects of the extract on the tumors of the animals in the TR-1-G. The antiproliferative effects of the Abies alba and Viscum album se abies extract may be due to the lectins and thionins contained in Viscum album, as well as to the monoterpenes contained in Abies alba. Soft tissue tumors sensitive to the extract, are widespread among human organs, even in larynx, and are usually resistant to chemotherapy.	viscum album leiomyosarcomas
1	Phytochemical and biological activities of four wild medicinal plants.The fruits of four wild plants, namely, Capparis decidua, Ficus carica, Syzygium cumini, and Ziziphus jujuba, are separately used as traditional dietary and remedial agents in remote areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. The results of our study on these four plants revealed that the examined fruits were a valuable source of nutraceuticals and exhibited good level of antimicrobial activity. The fruits of these four investigated plants are promising source of polyphenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, and saponins. These four plants' fruits are good sources of iron, zinc, copper, manganese, selenium, and chromium. It was also observed that these fruits are potential source of antioxidant agent and the possible reason could be that these samples had good amount of phytochemicals. Hence, the proper propagation, conservation, and chemical investigation are recommended so that these fruits should be incorporated for the eradication of food and health related problems. 	ziziphus jujuba polyphenols
0	Nitidine Chloride Is a Mechanism-Based Inactivator of CYP2D6.Nitidine chloride (NC) is a benzophenanthridine alkaloid isolated from the roots of Zanthoxylum nitidum (Roxb.) DC, a widely used traditional herbal medicine. Several reports have revealed NC's multiple pharmacologic properties. The inhibitory effects of NC on human cytochrome P450 enzymes were investigated in the present study. We found that NC caused time- and concentration-dependent inhibition of CYP2D6, and more than 50% of CYP2D6 activity was suppressed after a 15-minute incubation with NC at 100 muM in the primary incubation mixtures, with KI of 4.36 muM, kinact of 0.052 minute-1, and a partition ratio of approximately 290. Moreover, the loss of CYP2D6 activity required the presence of NADPH. Superoxide dismutase/catalase and glutathione showed minor protection against the NC-induced enzyme inhibition. Quinidine as a competitive inhibitor of CYP2D6 slowed down the inactivation by NC. Trapping experiments using N-acetylcysteine demonstrated that quinone and/or carbene intermediate(s) were/was generated in human liver microsomal incubations with NC. In addition, potassium ferricyanide prevented the enzyme from the inactivation mediated by NC, which provided evidence that inhibition of CYP2D6 resulted from heme destruction by the formation of a carbene-iron complex. CYP1A2 was found to be the major enzyme involved in the generation of NC quinone metabolites. In conclusion, NC is a mechanism-based inactivator of CYP2D6. The generation of a carbene intermediate might be mainly responsible for the enzyme inactivation.	NC CYP2D6
3	Effects of canthin-6-one alkaloids from Zanthoxylum chiloperone on Trypanosoma cruzi-infected mice.Canthin-6-one (1), isolated from Zanthoxylum chiloperone (Rutaceae), possesses a broad sprectum of antifungal and leishmanicidal activities. In this study, we have examined the antiparasitic effects of canthin-6-one (1), 5-methoxycanthin-6-one (2), canthin-6-one N-oxide (3), as well as that of the total alkaloids of Zanthoxylum chiloperone stem bark, in Balb/c mice infected either acutely or chronically with Trypanosoma cruzi. The compounds were administered orally or subcutaneously at 5mg/kg/day for 2 weeks, whereas the alkaloidal extract was given at 50mg/kg/day for 2 weeks. The antiparasitic activity was compared with that of benznidazole given at 50mg/kg/day for 2 weeks. In the case of acute infection, parasiteamia was significantly reduced following oral treatment with canthin-6-one (1). Moreover, the total alkaloids of Zanthoxylum chiloperone stem bark led to high levels of parasitological clearance. Seventy days post-infection, the serological response in the acute model was significantly different between oral canthin-6-one (1) and benznidazole-treated mice. Chronic model of the disease showed that both canthin-6-one (1) and the alkaloidal extract at the above dosage induced 80-100% animal survival compared to untreated controls. These results indicate that canthin-6-one (1) exhibits trypanocidal activity in vivo in the mouse model of acute or chronic infection. This is the first demonstration of anti-Trypanosoma cruzi activity for a member of this chemical group (canthinones). Considering the very low toxicity of canthin-6-one (1), our results suggest that long-term oral treatment with this natural product could prove advantageous compared to the current chemotherapy of Chagas disease.	canthin-6-one chagas disease
2	Antimycobacterial, anti-inflammatory and genotoxicity evaluation of plants used for the treatment of tuberculosis and related symptoms in South Africa.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis strains and long duration of treatment has established an urgent need to search for new effective agents. The great floral diversity of South Africa has potential for producing new bioactive compounds, therefore pharmacological screening of plant extracts within this region offers much potential. To assess the in vitro antimycobacterial, anti-inflammatory and genotoxicity activity of selected plants that are used for the treatment of TB and related symptoms in South Africa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ground plant materials from 10 plants were extracted sequentially with four solvents (petroleum ether, dichloromethane, 80% ethanol and water) and a total of 68 extracts were produced. A broth microdilution method was used to screen extracts against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra. The cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme was used to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of the extracts and the Salmonella microsome assay using two Salmonella typhimurium strains (TA98 and TA100) to establish genotoxicity. RESULTS: Six out of 68 extracts showed good antimycobacterial activity. Three extracts showed good inhibition (&gt;70%) of COX-2 enzyme. All the extracts tested were non-genotoxic against the tested Salmonella strains. CONCLUSION: The results observed in this study indicate that some of the plants such as Abrus precatorius subsp. africanus, Ficus sur, Pentanisia prunelloides and Terminalia phanerophlebia could be investigated further against drug-resistant TB strains.	abrus precatorius subsp tuberculosis
1	Evaluation of the quality of Chinese and Vietnamese cassia using LC-MS and multivariate analysis.In the present study, the chemical composition of water extracts of Chinese and Vietnamese cassia (Cinnamomum cassia) were compared using multivariate analysis of LC-MS data. By principal component analysis of the LC-MS data, 6 compounds, cinnzeylanine (1), cinnzeylanol (2), anhydrocinnzeylanol (3), cinncasinol A (4), epicatechin (5) and procyanidin B2 (6), were identified as the marker compounds to characterize Chinese and Vietnamese cassia. It was clarified that Chinese cassia contains relatively larger amounts of epicatechin and procyanidin B2. On the other hand, Vietnamese cassia is characterized by a relatively larger amount of diterpenes. As catechin derivatives and diterpenes have different types of activity, it is important to choose the cassia that best suits the product for which it is to be used, whether in food or in herbal medicine.	cinnamomum cassia cinnzeylanol
1	Isobutylhydroxyamides from Sichuan Pepper and Their Protective Activity on PC12 Cells Damaged by Corticosterone.The pericarp of Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim., commonly known as Sichuan pepper, is a widely used spice to remove fishy odor and add palatable taste. A phytochemical investigation of the 95% ethanol extract of Sichuan pepper resulted in the isolation of 21 isobutylhydroxyamides, including 8 new ones named ZP-amides G-N, among which the chiral resolution of racemic ZP-amide A and ZP-amide B was successfully accomplished. The protective activity on corticosterone-treated PC12 cells of the isolated isobutylhydroxyamides was also evaluated. The new compounds 3-5 and the known compounds 1, 1a, 2, 2a, 11, and 15 improved the survival rate of PC12 cells. The bioactivity studies disclosed the potential of Sichuan pepper to be developed as new neuroprotective functional food.	sichuan pepper Isobutylhydroxyamides
1	Toxicity of Zanthoxylum piperitum and Zanthoxylum armatum oil constituents and related compounds to Stomoxys calcitrans (Diptera: Muscidae).Zanthoxylum plants (Rutaceae) have drawn attention because they contain insecticidal principles against insects. An assessment was made of the insecticidal and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activities of Zanthoxylum piperitum steam distillate and Zanthoxylum armatum seed oil, their 28 constituents, and eight structurally related compounds against female stable fly, Stomoxys calcitrans (L.). Results were compared with those of two organophosphorus insecticides chlorpyrifos and dichlorvos. Potent fumigant toxicity was observed with cuminaldehyde, thymol, (1S)-(-)-verbenone, (-)-myrtenal, carvacrol, (S)-(Z)-verbenol, Zanthoxylum piperitum steam distillate, cuminyl alcohol, Zanthoxylum armatum seed oil, piperitone, (-)-(Z)-myrtanol, and citronellal (LC50, 0.075-0.456 microg/cm3). However, they were five orders of magnitude less toxic than either chlorpyrifos or dichlorvos. An in vitro bioassay using female fly heads indicates that strong AChE inhibition was produced by citronellyl acetate, alpha-pinene, thymol, carvacrol, and alpha-terpineol (1.20-2.73 mM), but no direct correlation between fly toxicity and AChE inhibition by the test compounds was observed. Structure-activity relationships indicate that structural characteristics, such as carbon skeleton, degrees of saturation and types of functional groups, and vapor pressure parameter, appear to play a role in determining toxicities of the test monoterpenoids to stable flies. Global efforts to reduce the level of highly toxic synthetic insecticides in the agricultural environment justify further studies on Z. piperitum and Z. armatum oil-derived materials as potential insecticides for the control of stable fly populations.	z. piperitum alpha-terpineol
1	Comparison of drip, pipe and surge spring root irrigation for Jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) fruit quality in the Loess plateau of China.Loess Plateau is a typical rain-fed farming region, facing the threat of drought. Irrigation method is among the most important factors affecting jujube quality. This study investigated the response of Ziziphus jujuba Mill. cv. Lizao quality to three different irrigation methods (drip-, pipe- and surge spring root irrigation) combining two water levels (20 m(3)/hm(2) and 120 m(3)/hm(2)). The effects of the trials were evaluated by taking into account the physical-chemical characteristics of jujubes and the antioxidant activity. Concomitant to this, the concentration of some taste-related (viz. glucose, fructose, TSS and malic acid) and health-related compounds/parameters (viz. catechin and epicatechin) were generally much greater in jujube fruit treated with drip irrigation (120 m(3)/hm(2)). Different irrigation treatments had no significant effects on antioxidant capacity, total phenolics and proanthocyanidins (except for pipe irrigation 20 m(3)/hm(2)). The best compromise between quality and irrigation of jujube fruit was achieved with drip irrigation (120 m(3)/hm(2)). 	jujube fructose
4	Abrus Agglutinin, a type II ribosome inactivating protein inhibits Akt/PH domain to induce endoplasmic reticulum stress mediated autophagy-dependent cell death.Abrus agglutinin (AGG), a type II ribosome-inactivating protein has been found to induce mitochondrial apoptosis. In the present study, we documented that AGG-mediated Akt dephosphorylation led to ER stress resulting the induction of autophagy-dependent cell death through the canonical pathway in cervical cancer cells. Inhibition of autophagic death with 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and siRNA of Beclin-1 and ATG5 increased AGG-induced apoptosis. Further, inhibiting apoptosis by Z-DEVD-FMK and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) increased autophagic cell death after AGG treatment, suggesting that AGG simultaneously induced autophagic and apoptotic death in HeLa cells. Additionally, it observed that AGG-induced autophagic cell death in Bax knock down (Bax-KD) and 5-FU resistant HeLa cells, confirming as an alternate cell killing pathway to apoptosis. At the molecular level, AGG-induced ER stress in PERK dependent pathway and inhibition of ER stress by salubrinal, eIF2alpha phosphatase inhibitor as well as siPERK reduced autophagic death in the presence of AGG. Further, our in silico and colocalization study showed that AGG interacted with pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Akt to suppress its phosphorylation and consequent downstream mTOR dephosphorylation in HeLa cells. We showed that Akt overexpression could not augment GRP78 expression and reduced autophagic cell death by AGG as compared to pcDNA control, indicating Akt modulation was the upstream signal during AGG's ER stress mediated autophagic cell death. In conclusion, we established that AGG stimulated cell death by autophagy might be used as an alternative tumor suppressor mechanism in human cervical cancer.   2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

3	Cinnamaldehyde induces cell apoptosis mediated by a novel circular RNA hsa_circ_0043256 in non-small cell lung cancer.Cinnamaldehyde (CA), the primary chemical component of the Chinese traditional herb Cinnamomum cassia, is an effective cytotoxic agent against various human cancers. Our previous study indicated that CA could trigger apoptosis in three kinds of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. However, CA mechanism of action in NSCLC has not been unveiled completely. Herein, we showed that a novel circular RNA hsa_circ_0043256 was upregulated in NSCLC cells in response to CA treatment, as detected by microarray and real-time PCR. Hsa_circ_0043256 could inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis, while hsa_circ_0043256 knock-down could promote cell proliferation and restrain apoptosis induced by CA. Bioinformatics analysis predicted that hsa_circ_0043256 could work as a miR-1252 sponge, which could in turn directly target a vital negative regulator of Canonical Wnt signaling, Itchy E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (ITCH), as validated by dual-luciferase assay. Western blot results further confirmed that hsa_circ_0043256 could upregulate ITCH expression, whereas miR-1252 could partially abolish this effect. Interestingly, hsa_circ_0043256 knock-down could weaken Wnt/beta-catenin pathway inhibition induced by CA. Finally, we discovered that CA induced apoptosis and meanwhile upregulated hsa_circ_0043256 expression in vivo. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that ITCH expression was positively association with hsa_circ_0043256 levels. Above all, we characterized a new mechanism mediated by hsa_circ_0043256/miR-1252/ITCH axis in CA function against NSCLC, providing a novel insight into lung cancer therapy.	Cinnamaldehyde NSCLC
2	Detoxification of Abrus precatorius L. seeds by Ayurvedic Shodhana process and anti-inflammatory potential of the detoxified extract.BACKGROUND: Abrus precatorius seeds traditionally used for the treatment of sciatica and alopecia contains the toxic protein, abrin, a Type II Ribosome Inactivating Protein. Ayurveda recommends the use of Abrus seeds after the Shodhana process (detoxification). OBJECTIVE: The current study was aimed at performing the Shodhana process, swedana (boiling) of Abrus precatorius seeds using water as a medium and to evaluate the anti-inflammatory potential of seed extract post detoxification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Non-detoxified and detoxified extracts were prepared and subsequently subjected to various in vitro and in vivo assays. In hemagglutination assay, the non-detoxified extract shows higher agglutination of RBCs than detoxified extract indicating riddance of toxic hemagglutinating proteins by Shodhana. This was confirmed by the SDSPAGE analysis of detoxified extract revealing the absence of abrin band in detoxified extract when compared to non-detoxified extract. RESULTS: The cytotoxicity assay in HeLa cell line expresses a higher reduction in growth percentage of the cells with non-detoxified extract as compared to detoxified extract indicating successful detoxification. Brine shrimp lethality test indicated the reduction in toxicity index of detoxified extract as compared to non-detoxified extract. Further, the whole body apoptosis assay in zebrafish revealed that percentage of viable cells were greater for detoxified extract than non-detoxified extract. The anti-inflammatory studies using carrageenan induced paw edema model in rats was carried out on the extracts with doses of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg, per oral, where the detoxified extract exhibited significant inhibition of rat paw edema at both the doses comparable to that of Diclofenac sodium. CONCLUSION: Absence of toxicity and the retention of the anti-inflammatory activity of detoxified Abrus seed extract confirmed that the Swedana process is effective in carrying out the detoxification without affecting its therapeutic potential.	abrus precatorius edema
3	Inhibition of fungal spore adhesion by zosteric Acid as the basis for a novel, nontoxic crop protection technology.ABSTRACT To explore the potential for nontoxic crop protection technologies based on the inhibition of fungal spore adhesion, we have tested the effect of synthetic zosteric acid (p-(sulfo-oxy) cinnamic acid), a naturally occurring phenolic acid in eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) plants, on spore adhesion and infection in two pathosystems: rice blast caused by Magnaporthe grisea and bean anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum lindemuthianum. We have shown that zosteric acid inhibits spore adhesion to model and host leaf surfaces and that any attached spores fail to develop appressoria, and consequently do not infect leaf cells. Low concentrations of zosteric acid that are effective in inhibiting adhesion are not toxic to either fungus or to the host. The inhibition of spore adhesion in the rice blast pathogen is fully reversible. On plants, zosteric acid reduced (rice) or delayed (bean) lesion development. These results suggest that there is potential for novel and environmentally benign crop protection technologies based on manipulating adhesion.	zosteric acid infection
1	Proteasome inhibitors prevent tracheary element differentiation in zinnia mesophyll cell cultures To determine whether proteasome activity is required for tracheary element (TE) differentiation, the proteasome inhibitors clasto-lactacystin beta-lactone and carbobenzoxy-leucinyl-leucinyl-leucinal (LLL) were used in a zinnia (Zinnia elegans) mesophyll cell culture system. The addition of proteasome inhibitors at the time of culture initiation prevented differentiation otherwise detectable at 96 h. Inhibition of the proteasome at 48 h, after cellular commitment to differentiation, did not alter the final percentage of TEs compared with controls. However, proteasome inhibition at 48 h delayed the differentiation process by approximately 24 h, as indicated by examination of both morphological markers and the expression of putative autolytic proteases. These results indicate that proteasome function is required both for induction of TE differentiation and for progression of the TE program in committed cells. Treatment at 48 h with LLL but not clasto-lactacystin beta-lactone resulted in partial uncoupling of autolysis from differentiation. Results from gel analysis of protease activity suggested that the observed incomplete autolysis was due to the ability of LLL to inhibit TE cysteine proteases.	zinnia elegans clasto-lactacystin beta-lactone
1	Cinnamaldehyde suppresses NLRP3 derived IL-1beta via activating succinate/HIF-1 in rheumatoid arthritis rats.Cinnamaldehyde (CA) is an essential component of cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia Presland), which is often used as a flavoring condiment in beverages, pastries, perfumes, etc. Cinnamon is also used as herbal medicine in China and Southeast Asia to treat rheumatoid arthritis. However, the molecular mechanism is unclear. In this study, we aim to investigate its anti-inflammatory effects against Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using activated macrophages (Raw246.7) in vitro and adjuvant arthritis rats (AA) in vivo. The results demonstrated that CA significantly reduced synovial inflammation in AA rats, possibly due to suppression of the expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially the IL-1beta. Further investigation found that CA also suppressed the activity of HIF-1alpha by inhibiting the accumulation of succinate in cytoplasm. As we know, the reduction of HIF-1alpha nucleation slows down IL-1beta production, because HIF-1alpha activates the expression of NLRP3, which is involved in the assembly of inflammasome and processing of IL-1beta. In addition, CA also inhibited the expression of the succinate receptor GPR91, which in turn inhibited the activation of HIF-1alpha. In conclusions, our results suggested that CA might be a potential therapeutic compound to relieve rheumatoid arthritis progress by suppressing IL-1beta through modulating succinate/HIF-1alpha axis and inhibition of NLRP3.	cinnamomum cassia Cinnamaldehyde
3	Ceylon cinnamon does not affect postprandial plasma glucose or insulin in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance.Previous studies on healthy subjects have shown that the intake of 6 g Cinnamomum cassia reduces postprandial glucose and that the intake of 3 g C. cassia reduces insulin response, without affecting postprandial glucose concentrations. Coumarin, which may damage the liver, is present in C. cassia, but not in Cinnamomum zeylanicum. The aim of the present study was to study the effect of C. zeylanicum on postprandial concentrations of plasma glucose, insulin, glycaemic index (GI) and insulinaemic index (GII) in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). A total of ten subjects with IGT were assessed in a crossover trial. A standard 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was administered together with placebo or C. zeylanicum capsules. Finger-prick capillary blood samples were taken for glucose measurements and venous blood for insulin measurements, before and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 min after the start of the OGTT. The ingestion of 6 g C. zeylanicum had no significant effect on glucose level, insulin response, GI or GII. Ingestion of C. zeylanicum does not affect postprandial plasma glucose or insulin levels in human subjects. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment in Europe has suggested the replacement of C. cassia by C. zeylanicum or the use of aqueous extracts of C. cassia to lower coumarin exposure. However, the positive effects seen with C. cassia in subjects with poor glycaemic control would then be lost.	coumarin impaired glucose tolerance
4	MAPK inhibitors and pifithrin-alpha block cinnamaldehyde-induced apoptosis in human PLC/PRF/5 cells.Cinnamaldehyde (Cin) has been shown to be effective in inducing apoptotic cell death in a number of human cancer cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of pifithrin-alpha (PFTalpha; a specific p53 inhibitor) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) inhibitors [namely SP600125 (a specific JNK inhibitor), SB203580 (a specific p38 inhibitor) and PD98059 (a specific ERK inhibitor)] on apoptotic signaling transduction mechanism induced by Cin in human hepatoma PLC/PRF/5 (CD95-negative) cells. Using XTT assay, Cin exhibited a powerful cytotoxic effect and apoptotic induction in PLC/PRF/5 cells. Apoptosis was elicited when cells were treated with 1 microM Cin as characterized by morphological changes and the appearance of phosphatidylserine on the outer surface of the plasma membrane. Cin down-regulated the expression of Bcl-(XL), up-regulated mutant p53 and Bax proteins and promoted caspase-3 to active forms, as well as cleaving poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in a time-dependent pattern. This could be supported by the activation and phosphorylation of MAPKs, including JNK, ERK and p38 kinases. Pre-incubation with PFTalpha and specific MAPK inhibitors significantly diminished the effect of Cin-induced apoptosis. The activities of anti-apoptotic (Bcl-(XL)) and pro-apoptotic (Bax) proteins were remarkably affected by PFTalpha and PD98059 pre-treatment. PFTalpha effectively blocked PARP cleavage in cells treated with Cin, and also markedly prevented the phosphorylation of JNK, p38 and ERK proteins. These results suggest that p53 induction and MAPK signaling pathways are required for Cin-mediated apoptosis in PLC/PRF/5 cells.	Bax cancer
1	Characterization of the last step of lignin biosynthesis in Zinnia elegans suspension cell cultures.The last step of lignin biosynthesis in Zinnia elegans suspension cell cultures (SCCs) catalyzed by peroxidase (ZePrx) has been characterized. The k(3) values shown by ZePrx for the three monolignols revealed that sinapyl alcohol was the best substrate, and were proportional to their oxido/reduction potentials, signifying that these reactions are driven exclusively by redox thermodynamic forces. Feeding experiments demonstrate that cell wall lignification in SCCs is controlled by the rate of supply of H(2)O(2). The results also showed that sites for monolignol beta-O-4 cross-coupling in cell walls may be saturated, suggesting that the growth of the lineal lignin macromolecule is not infinite.	zinnia elegans sinapyl alcohol
1	Phytochemical and biological activities of four wild medicinal plants.The fruits of four wild plants, namely, Capparis decidua, Ficus carica, Syzygium cumini, and Ziziphus jujuba, are separately used as traditional dietary and remedial agents in remote areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. The results of our study on these four plants revealed that the examined fruits were a valuable source of nutraceuticals and exhibited good level of antimicrobial activity. The fruits of these four investigated plants are promising source of polyphenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, and saponins. These four plants' fruits are good sources of iron, zinc, copper, manganese, selenium, and chromium. It was also observed that these fruits are potential source of antioxidant agent and the possible reason could be that these samples had good amount of phytochemicals. Hence, the proper propagation, conservation, and chemical investigation are recommended so that these fruits should be incorporated for the eradication of food and health related problems. 	ziziphus jujuba flavonoids
2	Mechanistic insights into the neutralization of cytotoxic abrin by the monoclonal antibody D6F10.Abrin, an A/B toxin obtained from the Abrus precatorius plant is extremely toxic and a potential bio-warfare agent. Till date there is no antidote or vaccine available against this toxin. The only known neutralizing monoclonal antibody against abrin, namely D6F10, has been shown to rescue the toxicity of abrin in cells as well as in mice. The present study focuses on mapping the epitopic region to understand the mechanism of neutralization of abrin by the antibody D6F10. Truncation and mutational analysis of abrin A chain revealed that the amino acids 74-123 of abrin A chain contain the core epitope and the residues Thr112, Gly114 and Arg118 are crucial for binding of the antibody. In silico analysis of the position of the mapped epitope indicated that it is present close to the active site cleft of abrin A chain. Thus, binding of the antibody near the active site blocks the enzymatic activity of abrin A chain, thereby rescuing inhibition of protein synthesis by the toxin in vitro. At 1:10 molar concentration of abrin:antibody, the antibody D6F10 rescued cells from abrin-mediated inhibition of protein synthesis but did not prevent cell attachment of abrin. Further, internalization of the antibody bound to abrin was observed in cells by confocal microscopy. This is a novel finding which suggests that the antibody might function intracellularly and possibly explains the rescue of abrin's toxicity by the antibody in whole cells and animals. To our knowledge, this study is the first report on a neutralizing epitope for abrin and provides mechanistic insights into the poorly understood mode of action of anti-A chain antibodies against several toxins including ricin.	abrus precatorius toxicity
1	Comparative analysis of chemical compositions and antimicrobial activities of essential oils from Abies holophylla and Abies koreana activities of essential oils from Abies holophylla and Abies koreana.The chemical compositions and antibacterial and antifungal activities of essential oils extracted from Abies holophylla and A. koreana were investigated. GC-MS analysis revealed that 38 compounds comprised 95.88% of the A. holophylla essential oil, with the main components being bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-ol (28.05%), delta3-carene (13.85%), alpha-pinene (11.68%), camphene (10.41%), dl-limonene (7.61%), beta-myrcene (7.11%), trans-caryophyllene (5.36%), and alpha- bisabolol (3.67%). In the essential oil from A. koreana, 36 compounds comprised 98.67% of the oil, and the main compounds were bornyl ester (41.79%), camphene (15.31%), alpha-pinene (11.19%), dl-limonene (8.58%), fenchyl acetate (5.55%), and alpha-terpinene (2.29%). Both essential oils showed great potential of antibacterial activity against several bacteria tested, in the range of 2.2-8.8 mug per disc by the agar disc diffusion method, and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 5.5-21.8 mg/ml by the microdilution method. Both oils showed very effective antifungal activities toward all pathogenic strains tested, including Candida glabrata, with MIC values in the range of 0.5-2.2 mg/ml. As a whole, A.koreanaoil showed better antibacterial and antifungal properties than A.holophylla oil.	a. koreana camphene
1	In vitro efficacy of 75 essential oils against Aspergillus niger.Aspergillus niger is an opportunistic human pathogen and a strong air pollutant. A study was conducted with 75 different essential oils for the inhibition of hyphal growth and spore formation in Aspergillus niger. Cinnamomum zeylanicum (bark), Cinnamomum zeylanicum (leaf), Cinnamomum cassia, Syzygium aromaticum and Cymbopogon citratus were the top five essential oils which demonstrated marked inhibitory effect against hyphal growth and spore formation of A. niger. The chemical composition of these five most active essential oils was investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectra (GC-MS). Most of the other essential oils were found challenging to combat A. niger, suggesting their use as strong aroma therapeutic agents.	cymbopogon citratus essential oils
1	A novel drug candidate for Alzheimer's disease treatment: gx-50 derived from Zanthoxylum bungeanum.This study focused on a promising drug candidate, N-[2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethyl]-3-phenyl-acrylamide (gx-50), a compound extracted from Sichuan pepper (Zanthoxylum Bungeanum), to determine whether it would be an effective therapeutic for Alzheimer's disease (AD) via biological experiments. In vivo, we determined the pharmacokinetic profile of gx-50 and evaluated the effect of gx-50 on the cognitive abilities of amyloid-beta protein precursor transgenic (AbetaPP-Tg) mice by Morris water maze testing. In addition, we examined the effects of gx-50 on amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers in the brains of AbetaPP-Tg mice by immunohistochemistry. In vitro, we observed a direct effect of gx-50 on Abeta oligomers by atomic force microscopy, detected the neuroprotective effects of gx-50 by western blotting and cell apoptosis assays, and measured its effects on intracellular calcium currents by laser confocal microscopy. Experiments in vivo showed that gx-50 could penetrate the blood brain barrier and improve the cognitive abilities of mice. Moreover, gx-50 treatment decreased the accumulation of Abeta oligomers in the cerebral cortex. The results in vitro demonstrated that gx-50 could disassemble Abeta oligomers, inhibit Abeta-induced neuronal apoptosis and apoptotic gene expression, and reduce neuronal calcium toxicity. These results strongly suggest that gx-50 is a potential candidate drug for treating AD.	zanthoxylum bungeanum N-[2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethyl]-3-phenyl-acrylamide
2	Histochemical localization of glycoconjugates in the developing endolymphatic sac and vestibular end organs of the mouse.The distribution of glycoconjugates in the endolymphatic sac (ES) and vestibular end organs from the 12th gestational day (GD) in the developing mouse to the 6th day after birth was analyzed using six biotinylated lectins: wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), Abrus precatorius agglutinin (APA), Ulex europaeus agglutinin I (UEA-I), Ricinus communis agglutinin 120 (RCA120), Helix pomatia agglutinin (HPA), concanavalin A (conA). In the 13th and 15th GD sections, the luminal contents in the fetal ES were strongly labelled with lectins, while only a small amount of substance in the ES was labelled with lectins after the 17th GD. In the 13th GD sections, before the cupula and otoconia were formed, the fetal ES started to produce glycoconjugates labelled with WGA, APA, RCA120 and ConA. In the 17th GD sections, the immature cupula and otoconia were strongly labelled with WGA, APA and RCA120. Sugar residues stained by lectins detected in the substance of the fetal ES were the same as those found in the immature cupula and otoconia. HPA only stained the ES epithelium around the 13th and 15th GD. The fetal ES may interact with the formation of the cupula and otoconia, especially in the early stage during evolution and that HPA-reactive glycoconjugates may be related to the intracellular elements of the ES epithelium only during a well-defined phase of development.	ulex europaeus otoconia
1	Tyrosinase-inhibitory constituents from the twigs of Cinnamomum cassia.A methanol extract of the twigs of Cinnamomum cassia was found to possess inhibitory activity against tyrosinase. Purification of the MeOH extract afforded four new phenolics, cassiferaldehyde (6), icariside DC (9), cinnacassinol (10), and dihydrocinnacasside (13), together with 10 known compounds (1-5, 7-12, and 14). The structures of the new compounds were determined by spectroscopic data interpretation. Compounds 1-6 and 8-13 showed strong inhibitory activity against tyrosinase, with IC(50) values ranging from 0.24 to 0.94 mM.	cinnamomum cassia dihydrocinnacasside
3	Separation and purification of saponins from Semen Ziziphus jujuba and their sedative and hypnotic effects.Semen Ziziphus jujuba (SZJ) has long been used in Chinese traditional medicine for the treatment of anxiety and insomnia because of its effect of decreasing monoaminergic system activity; saponins are thought to be the main bioactive factors. To investigate the sedative and hypnotic effects of saponins from SZJ, silica gel column chromatography and thin-layer chromatography were used to purify the crude extract of total saponins from SZJ. High-performance liquid chromatography showed that saponins from SZJ comprised two components, compounds I and II. Animal tests were conducted using these two compounds to compare their sedative and hypnotic effects. Results showed that both compounds had a significant effect (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01) on walking time compared with that of the control group. Compound I had a significant effect on coordinated movement (P &lt; 0.05). Both compounds prolonged the suprathreshold barbiturate induced sleeping time (P &lt; 0.05). The number of sleeping animals increased by 30% and 20% for compounds I and II, respectively, under the subthreshold dose of sodium barbital.	saponins insomnia
1	Bioactive components in the fruits of Ziziphus jujuba Mill. against the inflammatory irritant action of Euphorbia plants.Chinese jujube (also known as Chinese date) is the fruit of Ziziphus jujuba Mill. (Rhamnaceae). As a famous folk medicine, it is used as antidote in traditional Chinese formula, Shi Zao Decoction, to relieve the drastic inflammatory irritant nature of Euphorbia species. The irritant activities may cause serious adverse effects in clinical practices. This study aimed to investigate the active components of Z. jujuba through the inhibitory effects on the inflammatory cells activated by Euphorbia kansui and prostratin, a phorbol ester isolated from Euphorbia fischeriana. Peritoneal macrophage of rat and splenic lymphocyte (splenocyte) of mouse were selected to evaluate these actions in vitro. Nitric oxide (NO) release of macrophage and the proliferation of splenocyte were examined through Griess method and MTT assay. TNF-alpha, as an important pro-inflammatory cytokines, was detected with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Six fractions extracted from Z. jujuba were evaluated and fraction F (triterpene acids fraction) was demonstrated to be the most active part, and then, 21 compounds isolated from Z. jujuba were tested at the concentrations range from 1 mug/ml to 100 mug/ml. The results show that 7 compounds of them are likely to be active compounds concerning to their pronounced inhibitory action on the activated inflammatory cells. These effects might be helpful to attenuate the irritant action of Euphorbiaceae plants and protect the gastrointestinal tissue from potent inflammatory injury, which should be beneficial to some diseases, like inflammatory bowel disease.	z. jujuba triterpene acids
3	Protective effects of cinnamic acid and cinnamic aldehyde on isoproterenol-induced acute myocardial ischemia in rats.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Cinnamomum cassia is a well-known traditional Chinese herb that is widely used for the treatment of ischemic heart disease (IHD). It has favorable effects, but its mechanism is not clear. To investigate the effects of cinnamic aldehyde (CA) and cinnamic acid (CD) isolated from Cinnamomum cassia against myocardial ischemia produced in rats by isoproterenol (ISO). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized equally to nine groups: a control group, an untreated model group, CA (22.5, 45, 90 mg/kg) or CD (37.5, 75, 150 mg/kg) treatment, or propranolol (30 mg/kg). Rats were treated for 14 days and then given ISO, 4 mg/kg for 2 consecutive days by subcutaneous injection. ST-segment elevation was measured after the last administration. Serum levels of creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), nitric oxide (NO), and blood rheology were measured after the rats were sacrificed. The hearts were excised for determining heart weight index, microscopic examination, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) measurements. RESULTS: CA and CD decreased the ST elevation induced by acute myocardial ischemia, decreased serum levels of CK-MB, LDH, TNF-alpha and IL-6, and increased serum NO activity. CA and CD increased SOD activity and decreased MDA content in myocardial tissue. CONCLUSION: CA and CD were cardioprotective in a rat model of ischemic myocardial injury. The protection was attributable to anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, as well as increased NO. The results support further study of CA and CD as potential treatments for ischemic heart disease.	cinnamic aldehyde ischemic heart disease
1	In Vitro Incorporation of Radioiodinated Eugenol on Adenocarcinoma Cell Lines (Caco2, MCF7, and PC3).Recently, the synthesis of radiolabeled plant origin compounds has been increased due to their high uptake on some cancer cell lines. Eugenol (EUG), a phenolic natural compound in the essential oils of different spices such as Syzygium aromaticum (clove), Pimenta racemosa (bay leaves), and Cinnamomum verum (cinnamon leaf), has been exploited for various medicinal applications. EUG has antiviral, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory functions and several anticancer properties. The objective of this article is to synthesize radioiodinated (131I) EUG and investigate its effect on Caco2, MCF7, and PC3 adenocarcinoma cell lines. It is observed that radioiodinated EUG would have potential on therapy and imaging due to its notable uptakes in studied cells.	clove Eugenol
1	Phytochemical analyses of Ziziphus jujuba Mill. var. spinosa seed by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.Ziziphus jujuba Mill. var. spinosa (Z. jujuba) seeds have attracted much attention within the field of medicine due to their significant effects against disturbances of the central nervous system. Secondary metabolites composition is key to the influence of the pharmaceutical and commercial qualities of this plant. In this work, the phytochemical profile of Z. jujuba seeds was analysed by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The UPLC-MS/MS information identified the main secondary metabolites in Z. jujuba seeds, including flavonoid C-glycosides, triterpene acids and unsaturated fatty acids. The leading chemical identified by UPLC-MS/MS was betulinic acid, and oleic acid was the leading volatile from the GC-MS results. All the samples tested showed similar phytochemical profiles, but levels of the chemical compounds varied. Principal component analysis revealed the principal secondary metabolites that could define the differences in quality. It was confirmed that the combination of UPLC-MS/MS and GC-MS was an effective technique to demonstrate the pharmaceutical quality of Z. jujuba seeds. 	z. jujuba flavonoid c-glycosides
2	Zanthoxylum avicennae extracts inhibit cell proliferation through protein             phosphatase 2A activation in HA22T human hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro             and in vivo.Hepatocellular carcinoma is a common type of cancer that is usually associated             with poor prognosis. In this study, we examined the in vitro and in vivo mechanisms             of the traditional Vietnamese herb Zanthoxylum avicennae on the inhibition of             HA22T human hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation. HA22T cells were treated             with different concentrations of Zanthoxylum avicennae extracts (YBBEs) and analyzed             with the MTT assay, western blot analysis, flow cytometry, siRNA transfection             assays and co-immunoprecipitation assay. Additionally, the HA22T-implanted xenograft             nude mouse model was applied to confirm the cellular effects. YBBEs showed a strong             inhibition of HA22T cell viability in a dose-dependent manner and significantly             reduced cell proliferation-related proteins as well as induced cell cycle arrest             in the G2/M phase. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) siRNA or okadaic acid totally             blocked YBBE-mediated cell proliferation inhibition. In addition, an HA22T-implanted             nude mouse model further confirmed that YBBEs inhibit HA22T tumor cell growth             and downregulate the survival and cell cycle regulating proteins, as well as activate             the PP2A protein. Our findings indicate that the inhibition of HA22T cell proliferation             by YBBEs is mediated through PP2A activation.	zanthoxylum avicennae hepatocellular carcinoma
0	Total flavone of Abelmoschus manihot suppresses epithelial-mesenchymal transition via interfering transforming growth factor-beta1 signaling in Crohn's disease intestinal fibrosis.AIM: To explore the role and mechanism of total flavone of Abelmoschus manihot (TFA) on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progress of Crohn's disease (CD) intestinal fibrosis. METHODS: First, CCK-8 assay was performed to assess TFA on the viability of intestinal epithelial (IEC-6) cells and select the optimal concentrations of TFA for our further studies. Then cell morphology, wound healing and transwell assays were performed to examine the effect of TFA on morphology, migration and invasion of IEC-6 cells treated with TGF-beta1. In addition, immunofluorescence, real-time PCR analysis (qRT-PCR) and western blotting assays were carried out to detect the impact of TFA on EMT progress. Moreover, western blotting assay was performed to evaluate the function of TFA on the Smad and MAPK signaling pathways. Further, the role of co-treatment of TFA and si-Smad or MAPK inhibitors has been examined by qRT-PCR, western blotting, morphology, wound healing and transwell assays. RESULTS: In this study, TFA promoted transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1)-induced (IEC-6) morphological change, migration and invasion, and increased the expression of epithelial markers and reduced the levels of mesenchymal markers, along with the inactivation of Smad and MAPK signaling pathways. Moreover, we revealed that si-Smad and MAPK inhibitors effectively attenuated TGF-beta1-induced EMT in IEC-6 cells. Importantly, co-treatment of TFA and si-Smad or MAPK inhibitors had better inhibitory effects on TGF-beta1-induced EMT in IEC-6 cells than either one of them. CONCLUSION: These findings could provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms of TFA on TGF-beta1-induced EMT in IEC-6 cells and TFA is expected to advance as a new therapy to treat CD intestinal fibrosis.	flavone TGF-beta1
1	2-undecanone rich leaf essential oil from Zanthoxylum armatum.The leaf essential oils of Zanthoxylum armatum DC (Rutaceae) from Kumaon, India, extracted by hydrodistillation, were analyzed by capillary gas chromatography (GC-FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The major classes of compounds found in the leaf oils were acyclic and menthane monoterpenoids as well as simple alcohols, aldehydes and ketones. The high proportion of non-terpenic acyclic ketones, notably 2-undecanone and 2-tridecanone, and the low abundance of undec-10-en-1-al and p-phellandren-8-ol make the composition entirely new. Other constituents present in significant amounts were oxygenated monoterpenes, which include 1,8-cineole, linalool, terpinen-4-ol, and alpha-terpineol, and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons represented mainly by trans-caryophyllene, a-humulene and germacrene D. On the contrary, the oil distilled from the leaves on the second day of distillation was characterized by a high content of 2-tridecanone (27.1%) and trans-caryophyllene (7.4%), as compared with 3.5% and 4.6%, respectively, for the fresh leaves; a slight decrease in pH of the distillate was also significant. Moreover, the presence of a high 2-undecanone content followed by 2-tridecanone is being reported for the first time for Z. armatum from this region. In terms of molecular diversity, the simple acyclic ketones dominate the essential oils as compared with linalool that was reported in several previous studies on Z. armatum. Therefore, the two acyclic ketones may be utilized to establish the origin and authenticity of the material.	z. armatum 2-undecanone
1	Comparative analysis of chemical compositions and antimicrobial activities of essential oils from Abies holophylla and Abies koreana activities of essential oils from Abies holophylla and Abies koreana.The chemical compositions and antibacterial and antifungal activities of essential oils extracted from Abies holophylla and A. koreana were investigated. GC-MS analysis revealed that 38 compounds comprised 95.88% of the A. holophylla essential oil, with the main components being bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-ol (28.05%), delta3-carene (13.85%), alpha-pinene (11.68%), camphene (10.41%), dl-limonene (7.61%), beta-myrcene (7.11%), trans-caryophyllene (5.36%), and alpha- bisabolol (3.67%). In the essential oil from A. koreana, 36 compounds comprised 98.67% of the oil, and the main compounds were bornyl ester (41.79%), camphene (15.31%), alpha-pinene (11.19%), dl-limonene (8.58%), fenchyl acetate (5.55%), and alpha-terpinene (2.29%). Both essential oils showed great potential of antibacterial activity against several bacteria tested, in the range of 2.2-8.8 mug per disc by the agar disc diffusion method, and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 5.5-21.8 mg/ml by the microdilution method. Both oils showed very effective antifungal activities toward all pathogenic strains tested, including Candida glabrata, with MIC values in the range of 0.5-2.2 mg/ml. As a whole, A.koreanaoil showed better antibacterial and antifungal properties than A.holophylla oil.	a. holophylla alpha-pinene
2	Phytotherapy against insomnia: extravagant claims or an alternative medicine?Insomnia or sleeplessness is a disorder characterized by a personal incapability to falling or staying asleep for a desirable period of time. Apart from Valeriana officinalis and Ziziphus jujuba most of the ethnobotanicals used for sleep disorders have not been evaluated for pharmacological or clinical efficacy against insomnia. Chinese herbal medicines involving polyherbal formulations are yet to be characterized and long-term side effects are yet to be evaluated. Anti insomniac phytotherapy opens up an exciting aspect of research which might benefit a large number of patients suffering from different degrees of insomnia.	valeriana officinalis sleep disorders
1	Identifying core features of adaptive metabolic mechanisms for chronic heat stress attenuation contributing to systems robustness.The contribution of metabolism to heat stress may play a significant role in defining robustness and recovery of systems; either by providing the energy and metabolites required for cellular homeostasis, or through the generation of protective osmolytes. However, the mechanisms by which heat stress attenuation could be adapted through metabolic processes as a stabilizing strategy against thermal stress are still largely unclear. We address this issue through metabolomic and transcriptomic profiles for populations along a thermal cline where two seagrass species, Zostera marina and Zostera noltii, were found in close proximity. Significant changes captured by these profile comparisons could be detected, with a larger response magnitude observed in northern populations to heat stress. Sucrose, fructose, and myo-inositol were identified to be the most responsive of the 29 analyzed organic metabolites. Many key enzymes in the Calvin cycle, glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathways also showed significant differential expression. The reported comparison suggests that adaptive mechanisms are involved through metabolic pathways to dampen the impacts of heat stress, and interactions between the metabolome and proteome should be further investigated in systems biology to understand robust design features against abiotic stress.	zostera noltii Sucrose
2	Secondary metabolites from the root wood of Zanthoxylum wutaiense and their antitubercular activity.Bioassay-guided fractionation of the root wood of Zanthoxylum wutaiense led to the isolation of five new compounds, wutaipyranol A (1), 8-methoxywutaipyranol A (2), demethoxywutaiensal (3), demethoxywutaiensol (4), and dihydrodemethoxywutaiensol (5), together with six known compounds. Their structures were elucidated by 1D- and 2D-NMR, as well as MS analyses. Among the isolates, wutaipyranol A (1), 8-methoxywutaipyranol A (2), and demethoxywutaiensal (3) exhibited antitubercular activities against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H(37) Rv in vitro, with MIC values of 52.4, 55.6, and 45.8 mug/ml, respectively.	zanthoxylum wutaiense demethoxywutaiensal
1	Preventive Effects of Total Flavonoid C-Glycosides from Abrus mollis on Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease through Activating the PPARalpha Signaling Pathway.Abrus pulchellus subsp. mollis (Hance) Verdc. (Leguminosae) is a well-known edible plant usually added to soups and beverages. In this study, vicenin-2 (1: ), isoschaftoside (2: ), schaftoside (3: ), and their enrichment fraction, total flavonoid C-glycosides, derived from the extracts of A. mollis, were firstly found to prevent nonalcoholic fatty liver disease both in vitro and in vivo. In the in vitro study, total flavonoid C-glycosides decreased the lipid accumulation in oleic acid-treated HepG2 cells. The mechanisms of total flavonoid C-glycosides are involved in the regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha and its downstream, and the reduction of proinflammatory cytokines. In high-fat diet-induced fatty liver rats, total flavonoid C-glycosides decreased the levels of glutamic-oxalacetic transaminease and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, and decreased the lipid accumulation both in the liver and blood without affecting food intake. In addition, total flavonoid C-glycosides also increased the activities of the antioxidant enzyme system in vivo. In conclusion, total flavonoid C-glycosides are active components of A. mollis on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and can be used in functional food and supplements for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease prevention and treatment.	a. mollis flavonoid c-glycosides
4	Development and characterization of immobilized cannabinoid receptor (CB1/CB2) open tubular column for on-line screening.Cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, are therapeutic targets in the treatment of anxiety, obesity, movement disorders, glaucoma, and pain. We have developed an on-line screening method for CB1 and CB2 ligands, where cellular membrane fragments of a chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line, KU-812, were immobilized onto the surface of an open tubular (OT) capillary to create a CB1/CB2-OT column. The binding activities of the immobilized CB1/CB2 receptors were established using frontal affinity chromatographic techniques. This is the first report that confirms the presence of functional CB1 and CB2 receptors on KU-812 cells. The data from this study confirm that the CB1/CB2-OT column can be used to determine the binding affinities (K(i) values) for a single compound and to screen individual compounds or a mixture of multiple compounds. The CB1/CB2-OT column was also used to screen a botanical matrix, Zanthoxylum clava-herculis, where preliminary results suggest the presence of a high-affinity phytocannabinoid.	CB1 glaucoma
1	Structural characterization of polysaccharides from Zizyphus jujuba and evaluation of antioxidant activity.Fruit of Zizyphus jujuba Mill, a traditional Chinese herb widely consumed in Asian countries, has been reported to possess several vital biological activities. This study intends to develop an appropriate analytical method for isolation of polysaccharides from Z. jujuba fruits and evaluate their antioxidant activity. Initially, powdered Z. jujuba fruits were subjected to hot water extraction, followed by ethanol precipitation, deproteination, dialysis and fractionation in a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column. One neutral polysaccharide fraction (ZJPN) and 3 acidic polysaccharide fractions (ZJPa1, ZJPa2 and ZJPa3) were isolated with the average MW ranging from 40,566 to 129,518 Da. GC analysis revealed that 6 monosaccharides, namely, rhamnose, arabinose, xylose, mannose, glucose and galactose were present in polysaccharide fractions. The galacturonic acid content in polysaccharide fractions followed the order: ZJPa3&gt;ZJPa2&gt;ZJPa1&gt;ZJPN. All the 4 polysaccharide fractions were found to be more effective in scavenging superoxide anions than hydroxyl radicals, while acidic polysaccharides showed a more pronounced effect in chelating ferrous ion.	z. jujuba arabinose
2	Abrin poisoning.Abrin is a toxic protein obtained from the seeds of Abrus precatorius (jequirity bean), which is similar in structure and properties to ricin. Abrin is highly toxic, with an estimated human fatal dose of 0.1-1 microgram/kg, and has caused death after accidental and intentional poisoning. Abrin can be extracted from jequirity beans using a relatively simple and cheap procedure. This satisfies one criterion of a potential chemical warfare agent, although the lack of large scale production of jequirity seeds means that quantity is unavailable for ready mass production of abrin for weapons. This contrasts with the huge cultivation of Ricinus seeds for castor oil production. At the cellular level, abrin inhibits protein synthesis, thereby causing cell death. Many of the features observed in abrin poisoning can be explained by abrin-induced endothelial cell damage, which causes an increase in capillary permeability with consequent fluid and protein leakage and tissue oedema (the so-called vascular leak syndrome). Most reported cases of human poisoning involve the ingestion of jequirity beans, which predominantly cause gastrointestinal toxicity. Management is symptomatic and supportive. Experimental studies have shown that vaccination with abrin toxoid may offer some protection against a subsequent abrin challenge, although such an approach is unlikely to be of benefit in a civilian population that in all probability would be unprotected.	abrus precatorius gastrointestinal toxicity
1	Effects of Tapinanthus globiferus and Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides extracts on human leukocytes in vitro.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at investigating the genotoxicity and cytotoxicity effect of Tapinanthus globiferus and Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides to human leukocytes. In addition, the reductive potential and the chemical composition of the two plant extracts were also determined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human leukocytes were obtained from healthy volunteer donors. The genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of T. globiferus and Z. zanthoxyloides were assessed using the comet assay and trypan blue exclusion, respectively. The antioxidant activity of the plant extracts was evaluated by the reducing power assay. Furthermore, high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector was used to characterize and quantify the constituents of these plants. RESULTS: T. globiferus (10-150 microg/mL) was neither genotoxic nor cytotoxic at the concentrations tested, suggesting that it can be consumed safely at relatively high concentrations. However, Z. zanthoxyloides showed cytoxicity and genotoxicity to human leukocytes at the highest concentration tested (150 microg/mL). In addition, the total reducing power of T. globiferus was found higher than Z. zanthoxyloides in potassium ferricyanide reduction. Both plants extract contained flavonoids (rutin and quercetin) and phenolic acids (chlorogenic and caffeic). CONCLUSION: The results obtained support the fact that some caution should be paid regarding the dosage and the frequency of use of Z. zanthoxyloides extract.	z. zanthoxyloides phenolic acids
1	[Determination of triterpenoic acids in fruits of Ziziphus jujuba using HPLC-MS with polymeric ODS column].A simple and sensitive method has been developed to simultaneously determine betunilic acid, oleanolic acid and ursolic acid in the fruits of Ziziphus jujuba from different regions by HPLC-MS. This HPLC assay was performed on PAH polymeric C18 bonded stationary phase column with mobile phase contained acetonitrile-water (90: 10) and with negative ESI detection mode. The developed approach was characterized by short time consumption for chromatographic separation, high sensitivity and good reliability so as to meet the requirements for rapid analysis of large-batch fruits of Z. jujuba from different habitats.	z. jujuba oleanolic acid
4	Differential antiproliferation effect of 2'-benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde in K-ras-transformed cells via downregulation of thiol antioxidants.2'-Benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde (BCA), one of the derivatives of 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (HCA) isolated from the bark of Cinnamomum cassia, induces apoptosis in human cancer cells. We found that BCA induces stronger antiproliferative effects in K-ras-transformed cells (RK3E-ras) than in isogenic non-transformed cells (RK3E). Treatment of RK3E-ras with BCA resulted in increased ROS generation and depletion of intracellular glutathione, whereas BCA-treated RK3E showed no significant increase in the ROS level with concurrent increase in intracellular glutathione (GSH). Thiol antioxidants recovered cell proliferation inhibition caused by BCA in both cell lines, while non-thiol antioxidants failed to recover cell death. BCA decreased metallothionein (MT) expression in RK3E-ras, while inducing remarkable MT expression in RK3E. The increase of intracellular GSH in RK3E is partially caused by differential induction of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS) due to BCA treatment. To evaluate the upstream pathway for differential expression of gamma-GCS and MT, we analyzed early DJ-1 (PARK7) and NF-E2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) changes after BCA treatment. In RK3E, DJ-1 expression considerably increased for 3 h with concurrent induction of Nrf2, whereas in RK3E-ras cells BCA decreased these protein levels. Based on these findings, it seems that the therapeutic selectivity of BCA in RK3E-ras results from decreased thiol antioxidants via decreased DJ-1 and Nrf2 expression.	K-ras cancer
1	Polysaccharide structure of degraded glucomannan from Abrus precatorius Linn. seeds.Degraded glucomannan was isolated from Abrus precatorius Linn. seed polysaccharide (Papilionaceae). Acid hydrolysis and methylation studies produced certain degraded methyl sugars as, 2, 3, 6-tri-O-methyl-D-glucose and 2, 3, 6-tri-O-methyl-D-mannose in 1:4 molar ratio. On the basis of hydrolysis and methylation experiments, a polysaccharide structure has been assigned to the degraded glucomannan and to the parent glucomannan of Abrus precatorius Linn. seed.	abrus precatorius polysaccharide
2	Interaction of gypsum and the rhizome of Anemarrhena asphodeloides plays an important role in anti-allergic effects of byakkokakeishito in mice.Gypsum is a crude mineral drug used in the formulas of Japanese kampo medicine and traditional Chinese medicine. The present study aimed to evaluate the anti-allergic effect of byakkokakeishito extract (BKT), which consists of gypsum (natural hydrous calcium sulfate), Anemarrhena Rhizome (rhizome of Anemarrhena asphodeloides), Cinnamon Bark (bark of trunk of Cinnamomum cassia), Oriza Seed (seed of Oryza sativa), and Glycyrrhiza (root and stolon of Glycyrrhiza uralensis), and to clarify the role of gypsum in the formula. We prepared BKT by boiling a mixture of various quantities of gypsum and fixed amounts of the other four crude drugs in water. We evaluated the anti-allergic activity of the formulations using three different murine models of allergy: contact dermatitis induced by painting hapten onto skin; allergic dermatitis-like symptoms induced by cutaneous injection of mite-antigen; and skin passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) reaction using ovalbumin as antigen. The calcium content in the various BKT samples was dose-dependently increased up to 60 g/day of human dosage. BKT significantly suppressed the allergic symptoms in the three different experimental models. The effect of BKT was augmented by increasing the gypsum dosage only in the PCA reaction model. The extract prepared from a mixture of Anemarrhena Rhizome and gypsum exhibited an effect comparable to that of BKT. BKT exhibits an anti-allergic effect in several animal models, which may provide experimental evidence for the clinical use of BKT in allergic diseases. Gypsum may augment the anti-allergic activity of BKT, presumably through increasing intestinal absorption of Anemarrhena Rhizome-derived active constituents. 	anemarrhena asphodeloides allergic diseases
1	Isobutylhydroxyamides from Zanthoxylum bungeanum and Their Suppression of NO Production.Four new unsaturated aliphatic acid amides, named zanthoamides A-D (1-4), and eight known ones-tetrahydrobungeanool (5), ZP-amide A (6), ZP-amide B (7), ZP-amide C (8), ZP-amide D (9), ZP-amide E (10), bugeanumamide A (11), and (2E,7E,9E)-N-(2-hydroxy-2-methylpropyl)-6,11-dioxo-2,7,9-dodecatrienamide (12)-were isolated from the pericarps of Zanthoxylum bungeanum. The structures of these compounds were elucidated by extensive use of spectroscopic methods, including HRESIMS, 1D and 2D NMR analyses and comparison with previously reported data. Compound 4 contained a rare C6 fatty acid unit with an acetal group. Results revealed that compounds 1, 5, 6, and 12 showed inhibitory effects on nitric oxide (NO) production in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages, with IC50values of 48.7 +- 0.32, 27.1 +- 1.15, 49.8 +- 0.38, and 39.4 +- 0.63 microM, respectively, while the other compounds were inactive (IC50 &gt; 60 muM). They could contribute to the anti-inflammatory effects of Z. bungeanum by suppression of NO production.	z. bungeanum Isobutylhydroxyamides
4	Abrus abrin derived peptides induce apoptosis by targeting mitochondria in HeLa cells.In our previous study, Abrus abrin derived peptide fraction (ABP) with molecular weight in range of 600-1500Da was shown to have potent antitumor activity in Dalton's lymphoma (DL) tumor bearing mice. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the mechanism of mitochondrial apoptosis induced by the peptide fraction. ABP was found to have selective antiproliferative activity (10ng-100ng/ml) on several tumor cell lines in vitro without having any cytotoxic effect on normal cell lines with a dose of 1000ng/ml. Analysis of the growth inhibitory mechanism in HeLa cells revealed DNA fragmentation with appearance of the sub G(0)/G(1) peak indicative of apoptosis. Further investigation results showed that the apoptotic machinery of HeLa induced by ABP was associated with the release of reactive oxygen species, a drop in mitochondrial transmembrane potential, upregulation of Bax, downregulation of Bcl-2, and activation of caspase-3. The peptide fraction was found to target mitochondria of HeLa cells as observed by confocal microscopy. This peptide fraction offers a source of mitochondria penetrating peptides which might have therapeutic induction of apoptosis in cancer cells.	caspase-3 cancer
4	Angoline: a selective IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway inhibitor isolated from Zanthoxylum nitidum.STAT3 signaling pathway is an important target for human cancer therapy. Thus, the identification of small-molecules that target STAT3 signaling will be of great interests in the development of anticancer agents. The aim of this study was to identify novel inhibitors of STAT3 pathway from the roots of Zanthoxylum nitidum (Roxb.) DC. The bioassay-guided fractionation of MeOH extract of Z. nitidum using a STAT3-responsive gene reporter assay led to the isolation of angoline (1) as a potent and selective inhibitor of the STAT3 signaling pathway (IC50=11.56 muM). Angoline inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation and its target gene expression and consequently induced growth inhibition of human cancer cells with constitutively activated STAT3 (IC50=3.14-4.72 muM). This work provided a novel lead for the development of anti-cancer agents targeting the STAT3 signaling pathway.	STAT3 cancer
1	Inhibition of STAT3 signaling pathway by nitidine chloride suppressed the angiogenesis and growth of human gastric cancer.STAT3 has been strongly implicated in human malignancies, and constitutive activation of STAT3 serves a crucial role in cell survival, angiogenesis, immune evasion, and inflammation. In this study, we showed that nitidine chloride, a natural phytochemical alkaloid derived from Zanthoxylum nitidum (Roxb) DC, exerts potent anticancer activity through STAT3 signaling cascade. Nitidine chloride dose dependently suppressed VEGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tubular structure formation in vitro and dramatically reduced VEGF-triggered neovascularization in mouse cornea and Matrigel plugs in vivo. This angiogenesis inhibition mediated by nitidine chloride was well interpreted by the suppression of Janus kinase 2/STAT3 signaling and STAT3 DNA-binding activity in endothelial cells. Furthermore, nitidine chloride suppressed the constitutively activated STAT3 protein, its DNA-binding activity, and the expression of STAT3-dependent target genes, including cyclin D1, Bcl-xL, and VEGF in human gastric cancer cells. Consistent with the earlier findings, nitidine chloride inhibited gastric tumor cell growth and induced tumor cell apoptosis in vitro and effectively suppressed the volume, weight, and microvessel density of human SGC-7901 gastric solid tumors (n = 8) at a dosage of 7 mg/kg/d (intraperitoneal injection). Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis further revealed that the expression of STAT3, CD31, and VEGF protein in xenografts was remarkably decreased by the alkaloid. Taken together, we propose that nitidine chloride is a promising anticancer drug candidate as a potent STAT3 signaling inhibitor.	zanthoxylum nitidum (roxb) dc nitidine chloride
1	Abelmoschus moschatus (Malvaceae), an aromatic plant, suitable for medical or food uses to improve insulin sensitivity.Abelmoschus moschatus (Malvaceae) is an aromatic and medicinal plant, distributed in many parts of Asia, including south Taiwan. The present study was undertaken to clarify whether the herb is effective in improving insulin resistance. Insulin resistance in rats was induced by a diet containing 60% fructose for 6 weeks. The degree of insulin resistance was measured by homeostasis model assessment of basal insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Insulin sensitivity was calculated using the composite whole body insulin sensitivity index (ISIcomp) during the oral glucose tolerance test. Insulin receptor-related signaling mediators in soleus muscles of rats were evaluated by immunoprecipitation or immunoblotting. The extract of A. moschatus had a higher level of polyphenolic flavonoids. A. moschatus extract (200 mg/kg per day) displayed the characteristics of rosiglitazone (4 mg/kg per day) in reducing the higher HOMA-IR index as well as elevating ISIcomp in fructose chow-fed rats after a 2-week treatment. Treatment with moschatus extract for 2 weeks increased post-receptor insulin signaling mediated by enhancements in insulin receptor substrate-1-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase step and glucose transporter subtype 4 translocation in insulin-resistant soleus muscles. A. moschatus is therefore proposed as potentially useful adjuvant therapy for patients with insulin resistance and/or the subjects wishing to increase insulin sensitivity.	a. moschatus polyphenolic flavonoids
2	Detoxification of Abrus precatorius L. seeds by Ayurvedic Shodhana process and anti-inflammatory potential of the detoxified extract.BACKGROUND: Abrus precatorius seeds traditionally used for the treatment of sciatica and alopecia contains the toxic protein, abrin, a Type II Ribosome Inactivating Protein. Ayurveda recommends the use of Abrus seeds after the Shodhana process (detoxification). OBJECTIVE: The current study was aimed at performing the Shodhana process, swedana (boiling) of Abrus precatorius seeds using water as a medium and to evaluate the anti-inflammatory potential of seed extract post detoxification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Non-detoxified and detoxified extracts were prepared and subsequently subjected to various in vitro and in vivo assays. In hemagglutination assay, the non-detoxified extract shows higher agglutination of RBCs than detoxified extract indicating riddance of toxic hemagglutinating proteins by Shodhana. This was confirmed by the SDSPAGE analysis of detoxified extract revealing the absence of abrin band in detoxified extract when compared to non-detoxified extract. RESULTS: The cytotoxicity assay in HeLa cell line expresses a higher reduction in growth percentage of the cells with non-detoxified extract as compared to detoxified extract indicating successful detoxification. Brine shrimp lethality test indicated the reduction in toxicity index of detoxified extract as compared to non-detoxified extract. Further, the whole body apoptosis assay in zebrafish revealed that percentage of viable cells were greater for detoxified extract than non-detoxified extract. The anti-inflammatory studies using carrageenan induced paw edema model in rats was carried out on the extracts with doses of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg, per oral, where the detoxified extract exhibited significant inhibition of rat paw edema at both the doses comparable to that of Diclofenac sodium. CONCLUSION: Absence of toxicity and the retention of the anti-inflammatory activity of detoxified Abrus seed extract confirmed that the Swedana process is effective in carrying out the detoxification without affecting its therapeutic potential.	abrus precatorius toxicity
3	Total Flavones of Abelmoschus manihot Remodels Gut Microbiota and Inhibits Microinflammation in Chronic Renal Failure Progression by Targeting Autophagy-Mediated Macrophage Polarization.Background: Recently, progression of chronic renal failure (CRF) has been closely associated with gut microbiota dysbiosis and intestinal metabolite-derived microinflammation. In China, total flavones of Abelmoschus manihot (TFA), a component of Abelmoschus manihot, has been widely used to delay CRF progression in clinics for the past two decades. However, the overall therapeutic mechanisms remain obscure. In this study, we designed experiments to investigate the renoprotective effects of TFA in CRF progression and its underlying mechanisms involved in gut microbiota and microinflammation, compared with febuxostat (FEB), a potent non-purine selective inhibitor of xanthine oxidase. Methods: In vivo, the CRF rat models were induced by uninephrectomy, potassium oxonate, and proinflammatory diet, and received either TFA suspension, FEB, or vehicle after modeling for 28 days. In vitro, the RAW 264.7 cells were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with or without TFA or FEB. Changes in parameters related to renal injury, gut microbiota dysbiosis, gut-derived metabolites, and microinflammation were analyzed in vivo. Changes in macrophage polarization and autophagy and its related signaling were analyzed both in vivo and in vitro. Results: For the modified CRF model rats, the administration of TFA and FEB improved renal injury, including renal dysfunction and renal tubulointerstitial lesions; remodeled gut microbiota dysbiosis, including decreased Bacteroidales and Lactobacillales and increased Erysipelotrichales; regulated gut-derived metabolites, including d-amino acid oxidase, serine racemase, d-serine, and l-serine; inhibited microinflammation, including interleukin 1beta (IL1beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and nuclear factor-kappaB; and modulated macrophage polarization, including markers of M1/M2 macrophages. More importantly, TFA and FEB reversed the expression of beclin1 (BECN1) and phosphorylation of p62 protein and light chain 3 (LC3) conversion in the kidneys by activating the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase-sirtuin 1 (AMPK-SIRT1) signaling. Further, TFA and FEB have similar effects on macrophage polarization and autophagy and its related signaling in vitro. Conclusion: In this study, we demonstrated that TFA, similar to FEB, exerts its renoprotective effects partially by therapeutically remodeling gut microbiota dysbiosis and inhibiting intestinal metabolite-derived microinflammation. This is achieved by adjusting autophagy-mediated macrophage polarization through AMPK-SIRT1 signaling. These findings provide more accurate information on the role of TFA in delaying CRF progression.	flavones chronic renal failure
2	Cinnamon and Chronic Diseases.Cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum and Cinnamon cassia), the eternal tree of tropical medicine, belongs to the Lauraceae family and is one of the most important spices used daily by people all over the world. It contains a lot of manganese, iron, dietary fiber, and calcium. Cinnamon contains derivatives, such as cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid, cinnamate, and numerous other components such as polyphenols and antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, anticancer effects. Several reports have dealt with the numerous properties of cinnamon in the forms of bark, essential oils, bark powder, and phenolic compounds, and each of these properties can play a key role in human health. Recently, many trials have explored the beneficial effects of cinnamon in Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, arthritis, and arteriosclerosis, but still we need further investigations to provide additional clinical evidence for this spice against cancer and inflammatory, cardioprotective, and neurological disorders.	cinnamon neurological disorders

0	Mechanisms of Action of Cassiae Semen for Weight Management: A Computational Molecular Docking Study of Serotonin Receptor 5-HT2C.Overweight and obesity is a growing global health concern. Current management of obesity includes lifestyle intervention, bariatric surgery and medication. The serotonin receptor, 5-HT2C, is known to mediate satiety, appetite and consumption behaviour. Lorcaserin, an appetite control drug, has demonstrated efficacy in appetite control by targeting 5-HT2C but causes undesirable side effects. This study aimed to explore the potential usage of Cassiae semen (CS), a well-known traditional Chinese medicine used to treat obesity. A computational molecular docking study was performed to determine the binding mechanism of CS compounds to the 5-HT2C receptors in both active, agonist-bound and inactive, antagonist-bound conformations. By comparing binding poses and predicted relative binding affinities towards the active or inactive forms of the receptor, we hypothesise that two of the CS compounds studied may be potent agonists which may mimic the appetite suppression effects of lorcaserin: obtusifoliol and cassiaside B2. Furthermore, two ligands, beta-sitosterol and juglanin, were predicted to bind favourably to 5-HT2C outside of the known agonist binding pocket in the active receptor, suggesting that such ligands may serve as positive allosteric modulators of 5-HT2C receptor function. Overall, this study proposed several CS compounds which may be responsible for exerting anti-obesity effects via appetite suppression by 5-HT2C receptor activation.	juglanin 5-HT2C
2	Cinnamon extract induces tumor cell death through inhibition of NFkappaB and AP1.BACKGROUND: Cinnamomum cassia bark is the outer skin of an evergreen tall tree belonging to the family Lauraceae containing several active components such as essential oils (cinnamic aldehyde and cinnamyl aldehyde), tannin, mucus and carbohydrate. They have various biological functions including anti-oxidant, anti-microbial, anti-inflammation, anti-diabetic and anti-tumor activity. Previously, we have reported that anti-cancer effect of cinnamon extracts is associated with modulation of angiogenesis and effector function of CD8+ T cells. In this study, we further identified that anti-tumor effect of cinnamon extracts is also link with enhanced pro-apoptotic activity by inhibiting the activities NFkappaB and AP1 in mouse melanoma model. METHODS: Water soluble cinnamon extract was obtained and quality of cinnamon extract was evaluated by HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) analysis. In this study, we tested anti-tumor activity and elucidated action mechanism of cinnamon extract using various types of tumor cell lines including lymphoma, melanoma, cervix cancer and colorectal cancer in vitro and in vivo mouse melanoma model. RESULTS: Cinnamon extract strongly inhibited tumor cell proliferation in vitro and induced active cell death of tumor cells by up-regulating pro-apoptotic molecules while inhibiting NFkappaB and AP1 activity and their target genes such as Bcl-2, BcL-xL and survivin. Oral administration of cinnamon extract in melanoma transplantation model significantly inhibited tumor growth with the same mechanism of action observed in vitro. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that anti-tumor effect of cinnamon extracts is directly linked with enhanced pro-apoptotic activity and inhibition of NFkappaB and AP1 activities and their target genes in vitro and in vivo mouse melanoma model. Hence, further elucidation of active components of cinnamon extract could lead to development of potent anti-tumor agent or complementary and alternative medicine for the treatment of diverse cancers.	cinnamomum cassia diabetic
3	In vivo and in vitro antiviral activity of hyperoside extracted from Abelmoschus manihot (L) medik.AIM: To assess the anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) effect of hyperoside extracted from Abelmoschus manihot (L) medik. METHODS: The human hepatoma Hep G2.2.15 cell culture system and duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) infection model were used as in vivo and in vitro models to evaluate the anti-HBV effects. RESULTS: In the cell model, the 50% toxic concentration of hyperoside was 0.115 g/L; the maximum nontoxic concentration was 0.05 g/L. On the maximum nontoxic concentrations, the inhibition rates of hyperoside on HBeAg and HBsAg in the 2.2.15 cells were 86.41% and 82.27% on d 8, respectively. In the DHBV infection model, the DHBV-DNA levels decreased significantly in the treatment of 0.05 g x kg(-1 ) x d(-1 ) and 0.10 g x kg(-1) x d(-1) dosage groups of hyperoside (P&lt;0.01). The inhibition of the peak of viremia was at the maximum at the dose of 0.10 g x kg(-1 ) x d(-1) and reached 60.79% on d 10 and 69.78% on d 13, respectively. CONCLUSION: These results suggested that hyperoside is a strong inhibitor of HBsAg and HBeAg secretion in 2.2.15 cells and DHBV-DNA levels in the HBV-infected duck model.	hyperoside HBV-infected

1	Invasion inhibitors of human fibrosarcoma HT 1080 cells from the rhizomes of Zingiber cassumunar: structures of phenylbutanoids, cassumunols.The methanolic extract and its EtOAc-soluble fraction from the rhizomes of Zingiber cassumunar inhibited invasion of human fibrosarcoma HT 1080 cells. From the EtOAc-soluble fraction, eight new phenylbutanoids, cassumunols A-H, were isolated together with 30 known constituents. The structures of new phenylbutanoids were elucidated on the basis of chemical and physicochemical evidence. Principal constituents were examined the inhibitory effects on the invasion of HT 1080 cells. Among them, phlain I and III, (E)-1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)buta-1,3-diene, (E)-1-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)buta-1,3-diene, and (-)-beta-sesquiphellandrene showed anti-invasion effects. Interestingly, (E)-1-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)buta-1,3-diene [inhibition (%) 46.8 +- 7.2 (p&lt;0.05) at 30 microM] significantly inhibited the invasion, and only a weak cytotoxic effect was observed.	zingiber cassumunar (E)-1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)buta-1,3-diene
1	From Zinnia to Arabidopsis: approaching the involvement of peroxidases in lignification.Zinnia elegans constitutes one of the most useful model systems for studying xylem differentiation, which simultaneously involves secondary cell wall synthesis, cell wall lignification, and programmed cell death. Likewise, the in vitro culture system of Z. elegans has been the best characterized as the differentiation of mesophyll cells into tracheary elements allows study of the biochemistry and physiology of xylogenesis free from the complexity that heterogeneous plant tissues impose. Moreover, Z. elegans has emerged as an excellent plant model to study the involvement of peroxidases in cell wall lignification. This is due to the simplicity and duality of the lignification pattern shown by the stems and hypocotyls, and to the basic nature of the peroxidase isoenzyme. This protein is expressed not only in hypocotyls and stems but also in mesophyll cells transdifferentiating into tracheary elements. Therefore, not only does this peroxidase fulfil all the catalytic requirements to be involved in lignification overcoming all restrictions imposed by the polymerization step, but also its expression is inherent in lignification. In fact, its basic nature is not exceptional since basic peroxidases are differentially expressed during lignification in other model systems, showing unusual and unique biochemical properties such as oxidation of syringyl moieties. This review focuses on the experiments which led to a better understanding of the lignification process in Zinnia, starting with the basic knowledge about the lignin pattern in this plant, how lignification takes place, and how a sole basic peroxidase with unusual catalytic properties is involved and regulated by hormones, H2O2, and nitric oxide. 	z. elegans lignin
2	Phytotherapy against insomnia: extravagant claims or an alternative medicine?Insomnia or sleeplessness is a disorder characterized by a personal incapability to falling or staying asleep for a desirable period of time. Apart from Valeriana officinalis and Ziziphus jujuba most of the ethnobotanicals used for sleep disorders have not been evaluated for pharmacological or clinical efficacy against insomnia. Chinese herbal medicines involving polyherbal formulations are yet to be characterized and long-term side effects are yet to be evaluated. Anti insomniac phytotherapy opens up an exciting aspect of research which might benefit a large number of patients suffering from different degrees of insomnia.	valeriana officinalis sleep disorders
1	On the possibility of lipid-induced regulation of conformation and immunogenicity of influenza a virus H1/N1 hemagglutinin as antigen of TI-complexes.The tubular immunostimulating complex (TI-complex) consisting of cucumarioside A2-2, cholesterol and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) from marine macrophytes is the perspective antigen delivery system for subunit vaccines. MGDG is a lipid matrix for the protein antigen incorporated in the TI-complex. The aim of the present work was to study the influence of MGDGs from different macrophytes on conformation and immunogenicity of the secreted recombinant uncleaved hemagglutinin monomer (HA0S) of influenza A virus H1/N1. Differential scanning calorimetry, fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism showed a dependence of the conformational changes of HA0S on the microviscosity of MGDG. The most viscous MGDG from Zostera marina induced the strongest rearrangements in protein conformation. Immunization of mice with HA0S within TI-complexes comprising different MGDGs resulted in an approximately 2-fold increase of the levels of anti-HA0S antibodies and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) compared with those induced by HA0S alone. TI-complexes based on MGDG from Z. marina stimulated the maximal production of GM-CSF. However, humoral immune response (anti-HA0S antibodies), unlike cell-mediated immune response (GM-CSF), did not depend on the physicochemical properties of MGDGs. It is assumed that this is due to the different localization and conformational lipid sensitivity of the HA0S regions, which are responsible for these types of immune responses.	z. marina cholesterol
2	Inhibition of xanthine oxidase by some Chinese medicinal plants used to treat gout.The enzyme xanthine oxidase catalyses the oxidation of hypoxanthine to xanthine and then to uric acid, which plays a crucial role in gout. A total of 122 traditional Chinese medicinal plants, selected according to the clinical efficacy and prescription frequency for the treatment of gout and other hyperuricemia-related disorders, have been evaluated for the enzyme inhibitory activity. Among the 122 methanol extracts derived from these species, 69 were shown to be inhibitory at 100 microg/ml, with 29 having greater than 50% inhibition. As to the equal amount of water extracts, 40 were disclosed to be active at 100 microg/ml, with 13 possessing more than 50% inhibition. At 50 microg/ml, 58 methanol and 24 water extracts exhibited inhibitory activity, with 15 of the former and two of the latter showing greater than 50% inhibition. The most active was the methanol extract of the twig of Cinnamomum cassia (Lauraceae) (IC(50), 18 microg/ml), which was followed immediately by those of the flower of Chrysanthemum indicum (Asteraceae) (IC(50), 22 microg/ml) and the leaves of Lycopus europaeus (Lamiatae) (IC(50), 26 microg/ml). Among the water extracts, the strongest inhibition of the enzyme was observed with that of the rhizome of Polygonum cuspidatum (Polygonaceae) (IC(50), 38 microg/ml). The IC(50) value of allopurinol used as a positive control was 1.06 microg/ml. The study demonstrated that the effects for these medicinal plants used for the gout treatment were based, at least in part, on the xanthine oxidase inhibitory action.	cinnamomum cassia gout
2	Antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities of ethyl acetate fraction from Zanthoxylum armatum in mice.Zanthoxylum armatum DC. is a traditional Chinese medicine that is prescribed to alleviate pain and treat inflammatory disorders. This species is distributed mainly in the southeast and southwest regions of China. In the present study, we found that ethyl acetate fraction of ethanolic extract of Z. armatum could significantly decrease acetic acid-induced writhing numbers, and suppress formalin induced licking times in the first phase at the highest dose and in the second phase at all tested doses. This observation revealed that Z. armatum extract possessed powerful antinociceptive activity. The mechanisms of the antinociceptive effect might be mainly involved in the periphery inflammatory analgesic. In addition, the ethyl acetate fraction also inhibited xylene-induced ear swelling in a dose-dependent manner in mice. Eight lignans [eudesmin, horsfieldin, fargesin, kobusin, sesamin, asarinin, planispine A, and pinoresinol-di-3,3-dimethylallyl] were identified as major components of the ethyl acetate fraction. Considering related studies reporting the anti-inflammatory activity for the identified lignans, lignan might be responsible for its anti-inflammatory activity. Our results confirm that the traditional use of Z. armatum in the treatment of inflammation and pain is warranted.	z. armatum inflammation
4	Involvement of prohibitin upregulation in abrin-triggered apoptosis.Abrin (ABR), a protein purified from the seeds of Abrus precatorius, induces apoptosis in various types of cancer cells. However, the detailed mechanism remains largely uncharacterized. By using a cDNA microarray platform, we determined that prohibitin (PHB), a tumor suppressor protein, is significantly upregulated in ABR-triggered apoptosis. ABR-induced upregulation of PHB is mediated by the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) pathway, as demonstrated by chemical inhibitors. In addition, ABR significantly induced the expression of Bax as well as the activation of caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in Jurkat T cells, whereas the reduction of PHB by specific RNA interference delayed ABR-triggered apoptosis through the proapoptotic genes examined. Moreover, our results also indicated that nuclear translocation of the PHB-p53 complex may play a role in the transcription of Bax. Collectively, our data show that PHB plays a role in ABR-induced apoptosis, which may be helpful for the development of diagnostic or therapeutic agents.	PHB tumor
3	Aromatic plant-derived essential oil: an alternative larvicide for mosquito control.Five aromatic plants, Carum carvi (caraway), Apium graveolens (celery), Foeniculum vulgare (fennel), Zanthoxylum limonella (mullilam) and Curcuma zedoaria (zedoary) were selected for investigating larvicidal potential against mosquito vectors. Two laboratory-reared mosquito species, Anopheles dirus, the major malaria vector in Thailand, and Aedes aegypti, the main vector of dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever in urban areas, were used. All of the volatile oils exerted significant larvicidal activity against the two mosquito species after 24-h exposure. Essential oil from mullilam was the most effective against the larvae of A. aegypti, while A. dirus larvae showed the highest susceptibility to zedoary oil.	essential oil malaria
2	Aromatic and Aliphatic Apiuronides from the Bark of Cinnamomum cassia.Cinnamomum cassia Presl (Cinnamon) has been widely cultivated in the tropical or subtropical areas, such as Yunnan, Fujian, Guandong, and Hainan in China, as well as India, Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia. Four new glycosides bearing apiuronic acid (1, 4, 6, and 7) and their sodium or potassium salts (2, 3, and 5), together with 31 known compounds, were isolated from a hot water extract of the bark of C. cassia via repeated chromatography. The structures of the new compounds (1-7) were determined by NMR, IR, MS, and ICP-AES data and by acid hydrolysis and sugar analysis. This is the first report of the presence of apiuronic acid glycosides. Some of the isolates were evaluated for their analgesic effects on a neuropathic pain animal model induced by paclitaxel. Cinnzeylanol (8), cinnacaside (9), kelampayoside A (10), and syringaresinol (11) showed analgesic effects against paclitaxel-induced cold allodynia.	c. cassia cold allodynia
2	Effects of Zanthoxylum piperitum ethanol extract on osteoarthritis inflammation and pain.Degenerative arthritis, also known as osteoarthritis (OA), is the most common type of arthritis, which is caused by degenerative damage of the cartilage, which primarily protects the joints, leading to inflammation and pain. The objective of this study was to investigate the in vivo and in vitro effects of treatment with ZPE-LR (90% EtOH extract of Zanthoxylum piperitum) on pain severity and inflammation. When using an in vivo OA model MIA (monosodiumidoacetate-induced arthritis) rats, ZPE-LR (100 mg/kg) oral-administratio significantly inhibited MIA-induced change in loaded weight ratio on the left foot, and articular cartilage thickness. To confirm the positive effects on pain relief, acetic acid, heat and formalin-induced pain were remarkably decreased by 50 and 100 mg/kg ZPE-LR oral-administration. Pain related KCNJ6 mRNA expression as well as K + current was increased after ZPE-LR treatment in BV-2 cells. To confirm the positive effects on inflammation, TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) induced inflammation measured by mouse ear thickness and biopsy punch weight and TPA-induced iNOS, COX-2 mRNA and protein expression were remarkably suppressed by 50 and 100 mg/kg ZPE-LR oral-administration. In addition, TPA-induced iNOS, COX-2 mRNA level and protein expression were reduced. Acetic acid, heat and formalin-induced pain were remarkably decreased by 50 and 100 mg/kg ZPE-LR oral-administration. We examined in vitro ZPE-LR effects in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells. LPS-induced p65 translocation to the nucleus was prohibited by ZPE-LR 100 mug/ml oral administration. Moreover, ROS generation by LPS was significantly inhibited by ZPE-LR 50 and 100 mug/ml treatment. To investigate new ZPE-LR activating mechanisms, the gene fishing method (not a typical term, should probably use PCR based genetic screening) was used. LPS-induced HPRT1 (hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1) was decreased by ZPE-LR. However, RPL8 (Ribosomal protein L8) which showed no change in mRNA expression due to LPS, did show increased mRNA levels after ZPE-LR treatment. Our data elucidate mechanisms underlying ZPE-LR and suggest ZPE-LR may be a potential therapeutic agent to modulate osteoarthritis inflammation and pain.	zanthoxylum piperitum osteoarthritis inflammation
1	Lignans from the bark of Zanthoxylum simulans.Investigation on the EtOAc extract of the bark of Zanthoxylum simulans led to the isolation of four new lignans including zanthoxylumin A (1), zanthoxylumin B (2), ( - )-magnolin (3), and ( - )-pinoresinol-di-3,3-dimethylallyl ether (4). Their structures were established by comprehensive analysis of the spectral data, especially 1D and 2D NMR spectra. 	zanthoxylum simulans lignans
2	Review: Diverse pharmacological properties of Cinnamomum cassia: A review.Cinnamomum cassia is widely utilized as a spice in different cookeries worldwide, especially in Asian cuisines. This herb is also being used in different forms of traditional medicine (Unani, Ayurvedic, Japanese and Chinese) for managing conditions like dyspepsia, peptic ulcer disease and ischemic brain injury. Recent studies have shown the scientific evidence for the medicinal use of this particular herb in several diseases like H. pylori infection, diabetes, brain ischemia and cancers. This article reviews the literature on potential benefits of the herb published within the last 10 years. The authors used Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms "Cinnamomum" with "cassia" or "arromaticum" to filter the PubMed database. To date, no systemic review focusing on medicinal use of C. cassia was found in the literature. Various research articles elucidating diverse pharmacological properties of C. cassia were identified. The standardised extract of C. cassia or the active compounds extracted from the herb might prove to be a novel candidate for early prevention and complimentary management of conditions like diabetes mellitus or H. pylori-associated disorders. 	c. cassia diabetes mellitus
1	Volatile organic nitrogen-containing constituents in ambrette seed Abelmoschus moschatus Medik (Malvaceae).A detailed investigation of the basic fraction of a CO2 extract of ambrette seeds (Abelmoschus moschatus) revealed a total of 58 nitrogen-containing compounds. The identification of these compounds was carried out by GC-MS and NMR. All the identified nitrogen-containing compounds are reported here for the first time in ambrette seeds. Among these are 27 pyrazine derivatives and 12 pyridines, including the tentative identification of four new natural compounds, 1-(6-ethyl-3-hydroxypyridin-2-yl)ethanone (1), 1-(3-hydroxy-5,6-dimethylpyridin-2-yl)ethanone (2), 1-(3-hydroxy-6-methylpyridin-2-yl)ethanone (3), and 1-(3-hydroxy-5-methylpyridin-2-yl)ethanone (4). The odor of the basic fraction was assumed to be due to these pyrazines and pyridines and also the presence of seven thiazoles. The odors described suggest that these N-compounds contribute to what is described in perfumery terms as the "natural and rounded" character of the ambrette extract.	abelmoschus moschatus pyrazines
3	Cinnamaldehyde suppresses NLRP3 derived IL-1beta via activating succinate/HIF-1 in rheumatoid arthritis rats.Cinnamaldehyde (CA) is an essential component of cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia Presland), which is often used as a flavoring condiment in beverages, pastries, perfumes, etc. Cinnamon is also used as herbal medicine in China and Southeast Asia to treat rheumatoid arthritis. However, the molecular mechanism is unclear. In this study, we aim to investigate its anti-inflammatory effects against Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using activated macrophages (Raw246.7) in vitro and adjuvant arthritis rats (AA) in vivo. The results demonstrated that CA significantly reduced synovial inflammation in AA rats, possibly due to suppression of the expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially the IL-1beta. Further investigation found that CA also suppressed the activity of HIF-1alpha by inhibiting the accumulation of succinate in cytoplasm. As we know, the reduction of HIF-1alpha nucleation slows down IL-1beta production, because HIF-1alpha activates the expression of NLRP3, which is involved in the assembly of inflammasome and processing of IL-1beta. In addition, CA also inhibited the expression of the succinate receptor GPR91, which in turn inhibited the activation of HIF-1alpha. In conclusions, our results suggested that CA might be a potential therapeutic compound to relieve rheumatoid arthritis progress by suppressing IL-1beta through modulating succinate/HIF-1alpha axis and inhibition of NLRP3.

1	Seasonal variation in the leaf essential oil composition of Zanthoxylum clava-herculis growing in Huntsville, Alabama.The seasonal variation in the chemical composition of the leaf essential oil of Zanthoxylum clava-herculis has been analyzed by GC-MS. Three individual trees were sampled four times during the course of the 2004 growing season. Notable differences were recorded in the essential oil yields from the three trees on the four collection dates; yields were highest in May and lowest in July. The leaf essential oils were made up of 25 components, largely menthane monoterpenoids, dominated by limonene (44-73%) and 1,8-cineole (16-43%), with lesser amounts of alpha-thujene, linalool, gamma-terpinene, and alpha-terpineol. The ratio of oxygenated monoterpenoids to monoterpene hydrocarbons generally increased during the season, largely reflected in the 1,8-cineole/limonene ratio.	zanthoxylum clava-herculis limonene
3	Delayed occurrence of H-ras12V-induced hepatocellular carcinoma with long-term treatment with cinnamaldehydes.Cinnamaldehyde from the bark of Cinnamomum cassia has been reported to have antitumor activity mediated by the inhibition of farnesyl transferase. We assessed in vivo the chemo-preventive effect of cinnamaldehydes on H-ras12V-induced hepatocellular carcinoma formation. A mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma was established by using the transgene of mutated H-ras12V under the regulation of albumin enhancer/promoter. When treated with cinnamaldehyde for 10 weeks, hepatic tumor development was delayed with 2'-benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde (BCA) compared with control hepatocellular carcinoma formation. The effect of 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (HCA) was comparable. The number of lesions and the size of each lesion were significantly reduced by BCA. Cell proliferation in the lesion was detected by incorporation of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU). BCA increased the number of splenocytes, concanavalin A-stimulated splenocyte proliferation and the infiltration of lymphocytes into liver. Data suggest that the delayed hepatic tumor development observed with BCA could be mediated by a long-term immunostimulating effect on T cells.	BCA hepatocellular carcinoma
1	[Study on the effects of different compatibility of guizhi decoction on component of volatile oil from Cinnamomum cassia by GC-MS].OBJECTIVE: To study the changes of volatile oil from different compatibility of Guizhi decoction and explore their connection. METHODS: The volatile oil of Cinnamomum cassia and different compatibility of Guizhi decoction extracted by steam distillation were analyzed by GC-MS. RESULTS: The main components of volatile oil in Cinnamomum cassia were found in different compatibility of Guizhi decoction and they accounted the most amount of total volatile oil,but the contents of the main components were decreased, there were more components existed in different compatibility of Guizhi decoction than those in Cinnamomum cassia, the new components came from Zingiber officinale mostly. CONCLUSION: GC-MS can be used to reflect the changes of volatile oil from different compatibility of Guizhi decoction, and the result will provide some evidence for the research of regular pattern of compatibility in Guizhi decoction.	zingiber officinale volatile oil
1	Hepatoprotective activity of leaves of Zanthoxylum armatum DC in CCl4 induced hepatotoxicity in rats.Zanthoxylum armatum DC (Rutaceae) is extensively used in indigenous system of medicine as a tonic, carminative, stomachic and anthelmintic. In the present study, the hepatoprotective activity of the leaves ethanolic extract of Z. armatum (EEZA) was evaluated in CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity in rats. The extract at a dose of 500 mg/kg registered a significant decrease in the levels of serum glutamyl oxalacetic acid transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamyl pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase (ALKP), and serum bilurubin (SBLN) and liver inflammation, which was supported by histopathological studies on liver, thus exhibited a significant hepatoprotective activity. The phytochemical screening of defatted ethanolic extract showed the presence of sterols, alkaloids, flavonoids, and reducing sugars.	z. armatum flavonoids

Although 2-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (HCA), another compound from Cinnamomum cassia, has been widely studied with regard to its antitumor activity, MCA has not attracted researchers' interest due to its mild toxic effects on cancer cells and its mechanisms of action remain unknown. In this study, we examined the effects of MCA on the TNF-alpha-induced proliferation and migration of human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). As shown by our results, MCA inhibited TNF-alpha-induced cell proliferation by reducing the levels of cyclin D1, cyclin D3, CDK4 and CDK6, and increasing the levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p21 and p27, without resulting in cellular cytotoxicity. Furthermore, MCA decreased the level of secreted matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 by inhibiting MMP-9 transcription. Unexpectedly, MCA did not affect the TNF-alpha-induced levels of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). However, by showing that MCA potently inhibited the degradation of IkappaBalpha and the subsequent nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), we demonstrated that MCA exerts its effects through the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. MCA also effectively inhibited platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced HASMC migration. Taken together, these observations suggest that MCA has the potential for use as an anti-atherosclerotic agent.	MCA IkappaBalpha
2	Traditional medicine practices among community members with chronic kidney disease in northern Tanzania: an ethnomedical survey.BACKGROUND: In sub-Saharan Africa, chronic kidney disease (CKD) is being recognized as a non-communicable disease (NCD) with high morbidity and mortality. In countries like Tanzania, people access many sources, including traditional medicines, to meet their healthcare needs for NCDs, but little is known about traditional medicine practices among people with CKD. Therefore, we sought to characterize these practices among community members with CKD in northern Tanzania. METHODS: Between December 2013 and June 2014, we administered a previously-developed survey to a random sample of adult community-members from the Kilimanjaro Region; the survey was designed to measure traditional medicine practices such as types, frequencies, reasons, and modes. Participants were also tested for CKD, diabetes, hypertension, and HIV as part of the CKD-AFRiKA study. To identify traditional medicines used in the local treatment of kidney disease, we reviewed the qualitative sessions which had previously been conducted with key informants. RESULTS: We enrolled 481 adults of whom 57 (11.9 %) had CKD. The prevalence of traditional medicine use among adults with CKD was 70.3 % (95 % CI 50.0-84.9 %), and among those at risk for CKD (n = 147; 30.6 %), it was 49.0 % (95 % CI 33.1-65.0 %). Among adults with CKD, the prevalence of concurrent use of traditional medicine and biomedicine was 33.2 % (11.4-65.6 %). Symptomatic ailments (66.7 %; 95 % CI 17.3-54.3), malaria/febrile illnesses (64.0 %; 95 % CI 44.1-79.9), and chronic diseases (49.6 %; 95 % CI 28.6-70.6) were the most prevalent uses for traditional medicines. We identified five plant-based traditional medicines used for the treatment of kidney disease: Aloe vera, Commifora africana, Cymbopogon citrullus, Persea americana, and Zanthoxylum chalybeum. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of traditional medicine use is high among adults with and at risk for CKD in northern Tanzania where they use them for a variety of conditions including other NCDs. Additionally, many of these same people access biomedicine and traditional medicines concurrently. The traditional medicines used for the local treatment of kidney disease have a variety of activities, and people with CKD may be particularly vulnerable to adverse effects. Recognizing these traditional medicine practices will be important in shaping CKD treatment programs and public health policies aimed at addressing CKD.	zanthoxylum chalybeum kidney disease
2	HPLC method for measurement of human salivary alpha-amylase inhibition by aqueous plant extracts.Control of hyperglycemia is an important treatment in metabolic disorders such as type II diabetes and obesity. alpha-Amylase, as the first enzyme of glucose release from dietary polysaccharides, is a potential target to identify new sources of novel anti-obesity and anti-diabetic drugs. In this work, different herbal extracts as alpha-amylase inhibitors were studied by measuring the rate of the cleavage of a maltooligomer substrate 2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl-beta-D-maltoheptoside. Measurement of chromophore containing products after reversed phase HPLC separation was used for alpha-amylase activity measurement. Rates of hydrolysis catalysed by human salivary alpha-amylase were determined in the presence and absence of lyophilised water extracts of eleven herbs. Remarkable bioactivities were found for extracts of Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume (bark), Camellia sinensis L. (leaf), Ribes nigrum L. (leaf), Laurus nobilis L. (leaf), Vaccinium macrocarpon Aiton (fruit) and Syzygium aromaticum L. (bud). Determined IC50 values were in 0.017-41 mug/ml range for these six selected plant extracts. Our results confirm the applicability of this HPLC-based method for the quick and reliable comparison of plants as alpha-amylase inhibitors.	laurus nobilis l type ii diabetes
1	Analgesia Synergism of Essential Oil from Pericarp of Zanthoxylum schinifolium and Verapamil.Objective. To evaluate the synergistic analgesic effect of essential oil of Zanthoxylum schinifolium Sieb. et Zucc. (EOZ) and verapamil (Ver). Method. The qualitative and quantitative composition of EOZ were determined with gas chromatography/Mass spectrometer. The interaction between EOZ and Ver in antinociceptive activity was evaluated by using acetic acid-induced writhing, hot plate, and tail flick tests in mice and in isolated toad sciatic nerve test. Results. Linalool, limonene, and sabinene are the major components of EOZ. EOZ (middle-dose: 40 mg kg(-1), high-dose: 80 mg kg(-1)) and EOZ + Ver (Each dose group) have remarkable analgesic effects on pain in mice induced by acetic acid-induced writhing, hot plate, and tail flick tests. Low-dose EOZ (20 mg kg(-1)) had no analgesic action, but when it is combined with Ver it has shown significant antinociception. Verapamil has a faint analgesic effect but was not able to inhibit action potential transmission in toad sciatic nerve. EOZ (0.2%) and EOZ + Ver (0.2% + 0.05%) also inhibited action potential transmission in toad sciatic nerve. Combination of EOZ with Ver had a greater analgesic effect and inhibition of nerve action potential transmission compared to its components EOZ and Ver. Conclusion. The combination of EOZ with Ver produces a synergistic analgesic effect. 	zanthoxylum schinifolium Linalool
1	Phytochemical analyses of Ziziphus jujuba Mill. var. spinosa seed by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.Ziziphus jujuba Mill. var. spinosa (Z. jujuba) seeds have attracted much attention within the field of medicine due to their significant effects against disturbances of the central nervous system. Secondary metabolites composition is key to the influence of the pharmaceutical and commercial qualities of this plant. In this work, the phytochemical profile of Z. jujuba seeds was analysed by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The UPLC-MS/MS information identified the main secondary metabolites in Z. jujuba seeds, including flavonoid C-glycosides, triterpene acids and unsaturated fatty acids. The leading chemical identified by UPLC-MS/MS was betulinic acid, and oleic acid was the leading volatile from the GC-MS results. All the samples tested showed similar phytochemical profiles, but levels of the chemical compounds varied. Principal component analysis revealed the principal secondary metabolites that could define the differences in quality. It was confirmed that the combination of UPLC-MS/MS and GC-MS was an effective technique to demonstrate the pharmaceutical quality of Z. jujuba seeds. 	z. jujuba betulinic acid
2	Insect repellent activity of medicinal plant oils against Aedes aegypti (Linn.), Anopheles minimus (Theobald) and Culex quinquefasciatus Say based on protection time and biting rate.This study investigated insect bite protection and length of the protection with 30 repellents which were divided into 3 categories: plant oil, essential oil and essential oil with ethyl alcohol, tested against three mosquito species, Aedes aegypti, Anopheles minimus and Culex quinquefasciatus, under laboratory conditions. The plant oil group was comprised of Phlai (Zingiber cassumunar) and Sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum). Both substances were effective as repellents and feeding deterrents against An. minimus (205 minutes protection time and a biting rate of 0.9%), Cx. quinquefasciatus (165 minutes protection time and 0.9% biting rate) and Ae. aegypti (90 minutes protection time and 0.8% biting rate). Essential oil from citronella grass (Cymbopogon nardus) exhibited protection against biting from all 3 mosquito species: for An. minimus, Cx. quinquefasciatus and Ae. aegypti, the results were 130 minutes and 0.9%, 140 minutes and 0.8%, and 115 minutes and 0.8%, respectively. The period of protection time against Ae. aegypti for all repellent candidates tested was lower than the Thai Industrial Standards Institute (TISI) determined time of greater than 2 hours.	ocimum basilicum essential oil
0	Compounds from Sichuan and Melegueta peppers activate, covalently and non-covalently, TRPA1 and TRPV1 channels.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Oily extracts of Sichuan and Melegueta peppers evoke pungent sensations mediated by different alkylamides [mainly hydroxy-alpha-sanshool (alpha-SOH)] and hydroxyarylalkanones (6-shogaol and 6-paradol). We assessed how transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) and TRP vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), two chemosensory ion channels, participate in these pungent sensations. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The structure-activity relationships of these molecules on TRPA1 and TRPV1 was measured by testing natural and synthetic analogues using calcium and voltage imaging on dissociated dorsal root ganglia neurons and human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing the wild-type channels or specific cysteine mutants using glutathione trapping as a model to probe TRPA1 activation. In addition, using Trpv1 knockout mice, the compounds' aversive responses were measured in a taste brief-access test. KEY RESULTS: For TRPA1 activation, the cis C6 double bond in the polyenic chain of alpha-SOH was critical, whereas no structural specificity was required for activation of TRPV1. Both 6-shogaol and 6-paradol were found to activate TRPV1 and TRPA1 channels, whereas linalool, an abundant terpene in Sichuan pepper, activated TRPA1 but not TRPV1 channels. Alkylamides and 6-shogaol act on TRPA1 by covalent bonding whereas none of these compounds activated TRPV1 through such interactions. Finally, TRPV1 mutant mice retained sensitivity to 6-shogaol but were not responsive to alpha-SOH. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The pungent nature of components of Sichuan and Melegueta peppers was mediated via interactions with TRPA1 and TRPV1 channels and may explain the aversive properties of these compounds.	6-paradol TRPV1
1	SPE-HPLC method for the determination of four flavonols in rat plasma and urine after oral administration of Abelmoschus manihot extract.A SPE-HPLC method was developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of flavonols, isoquercitrin (1), hibifolin (2), myricetin (3), quercetin-3'-O-d-glucoside (4) and quercetin (5) in rat plasma and urine after oral administration of the total flavonoids from Abelmoschus manihot (TFA). The astragalin (6) and kaempferol (7) were used as internal standards (IS). Plasma and urine samples were pretreated by solid-phase extraction using Winchem C(18) reversed-phase cartridges. Analysis of the plasma and urinary extract was performed on YMC-Pack ODS-A C(18) and Thermo ODS-2HYEPRSIL C(18) reversed-phase column, respectively and a mobile phase of acetonitrile-0.1% phosphoric acid was employed. HPLC analysis was conducted with different elution gradients. The flow rate was 1.0 mL/min and the detection wavelength was set at 370 nm. Calibration ranges in plasma for flavonols 2-5 were at 0.011-2.220, 0.014-2.856, 0.022-4.320, and 0.028-5.600 microg/mL, respectively. In urine calibration ranges for flavonols 1, 2, 4 and 5 were at 2.00-16.00, 8.56-102.72, 2.70-21.60, and 3.00-24.00 microg/mL, respectively. The RSD of intra- and inter-day was less than 5.40% and 4.89% in plasma, and less than 3.96% and 6.85% in urine for all the analyses. A preliminary experiment to investigate the plasma concentration and urinary excretion of the flavonols after oral administration of TFA to rats demonstrated that the present method was suitable for determining the flavonols in rat plasma and urine.	abelmoschus manihot myricetin
1	Trans-Cinnamic Acid Stimulates White Fat Browning and Activates Brown Adipocytes.Recently, pharmacological activation of brown fat and induction of white fat browning (beiging) have been considered promising strategies to treat obesity. To search for natural products that could stimulate the process of browning in adipocytes, we evaluated the activity of trans-cinnamic acid (tCA), a class of cinnamon from the bark of Cinnamomum cassia, by determining genetic expression using real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and protein expression by immunoblot analysis for thermogenic and fat metabolizing markers. In our study tCA induced brown like-phenotype in 3T3-L1 white adipocytes and activated HIB1B brown adipocytes. tCA increased protein content of brown-fat-specific markers (UCP1, PRDM16, and PGC-1alpha) and expression levels of beige-fat-specific genes (Cd137, Cidea, Cited1, Tbx1, and Tmen26) in 3T3-L1 white adipocytes, as well as brown-fat-specific genes (Lhx8, Ppargc1, Prdm16, Ucp1, and Zic1) in HIB1B brown adipocytes. Furthermore, tCA reduced expression of key adipogenic transcription factors C/EBPalpha and PPARgamma in white adipocytes, but enhanced their expressions in brown adipocytes. In addition, tCA upregulates lipid catabolism. Moreover, mechanistic study revealed that tCA induced browning in white adipocytes by activating the beta3-AR and AMPK signaling pathways. tCA can induce browning, increase fat oxidation, reduce adipogenesis and lipogenesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and activate HIB1B adipocytes, suggesting its potential to treat obesity.	cinnamomum cassia tCA
3	Trans-cinnamaldehyde improves neuroinflammation-mediated NMDA receptor dysfunction and memory deficits through blocking NF-kappaB pathway in presenilin1/2 conditional double knockout mice.A chronic neuroinflammatory response has been considered as a critical pathogenesis promoting neurodegenerative progression in Alzheimer's disease (AD). During neuroinflammatory process, microglia are excessively activated and simultaneously release numerous pro-inflammatory mediators that cause synaptic dysfunction in the forebrain prior to neuronal degeneration and memory deficits in AD. Thus, prevention of neuroinflammation-mediated synaptic dysfunction may be a potential therapeutic approach against neurodegenerative disorders. Trans-cinnamaldehyde (TCA) is a primary bioactive component derived from the stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia, and it possesses potent anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities in in vivo and in vitro experiments. However, the in-depth molecular mechanisms of TCA underlying anti-neuroinflammatory and neuroprotective effects on memory deficits in AD are still unclear. The presenilin 1 and 2 conditional double knockout (PS cDKO) mice exhibit AD-like phenotypes including obvious neuroinflammatory responses and synaptic dysfunction and memory deficits. Here, PS cDKO were used to evaluate the potential neuroprotective effects of TCA against neuroinflammation-mediated dementia by performing behavioral tests, electrophysiological recordings and molecular biology analyses. We observed that TCA treatment reversed abnormal expression of synaptic proteins and tau hyperphosphorylation in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of PS cDKO mice. TCA treatment also ameliorated NMDA receptor (NMDAR) dysfunction including impaired NMDAR-mediated responses and long-term potentiation (LTP) induction in the hippocampus of PS cDKO mice. Moreover, TCA possesses an ability to suppress neuroinflammatory responses by diminishing microglial activation and levels of pro-inflammatory mediators in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of PS cDKO mice. Importantly, improving NMDAR dysfunction and memory deficits of PS cDKO mice was due to the inhibition of neuroinflammatory responses through TCA's interruptive effect on the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway. Therefore, TCA may be a potential anti-neuroinflammatory agent for deterring neurodegenerative progression of AD.	TCA AD
1	Differentiating parts of Cinnamomum cassia using LC-qTOF-MS in conjunction with principal component analysis.Cinnamon bark (Rou Gui in Chinese), cinnamon twig (Gui Zhi) and shaved cinnamon bark (Gui Sin) have been widely used as spices and in traditional Chinese medicine since ancient times. On-going issues related to quality and authenticity necessitate the development of analytical methods capable of providing an objective evaluation of samples. In this study, chemical fingerprints of cinnamon bark, cinnamon twigs and shaved cinnamon bark were established using liquid chromatography quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometry in conjunction with principal component analysis (PCA). From 125 samples of cinnamon, we identified the following eight compounds and their the detection ratios: coumarin, cinnamaldehyde, cinnamyl alcohol, cinnamic acid, 2-hydroxycinnamaldehyde, 2-hydroxycinnamic acid, 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde and 4-methoxycinnamaldehyde. Of these, 4-methoxycinnamaldehyde presented the largest variations in detection ratio, making up 64.0, 97.4 and 50.0% in cinnamon bark, cinnamon twig, and shaved cinnamon bark, respectively. The quantities of cinnamyl alcohol, coumarin and cinnamaldehyde also varied between the three parts of the plant. Chemical fingerprints of the three cinnamon samples were established using principal component analysis, the results of which indicate that cinnamon bark and shaved cinnamon bark could be easily differentiated, despite a marked similarity in outward appearance. Cinnamon twig was also shown to depart from the other clusters. The proposed method provides a fast and efficient means of identifying cinnamon herbs for quality control purposes.

1	Effect of molluscicidal components of Abrus precatorius, Argemone mexicana and Nerium indicum on certain biochemical parameters of Lymnaea acuminata.Exposure to 40% and 80% of the 24 h LC50 of the molluscicidal component of Abrus precatorius (abrin and glycyrrhizin), Argemone mexicana (protopine and sanguinarine) and Nerium indicum (oleandrin) caused a significant decrease in the levels of protein, free amino acid, DNA and RNA in the nervous tissue of Lymnaea acuminata. Except for glycyrrhizin, all the above molluscicides caused a significant reduction in phospholipid levels and a simultaneous increase in the rate of lipid peroxidation in the nervous tissue of treated snails.	argemone mexicana protopine
1	In vitro activities of plant extracts on human Loa loa isolates and cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells.Loa loa, a filarial worm, can cause fatal encephalitis in humans. In an attempt to find alternatives to the standard treatments (ivermectin and diethylcarbamazine citrate), we tested 12 methanolic extracts of nine traditional plant remedies. The extracts (100-0.09 microg/ml) were incubated with 20 Loa loa microfilariae isolated from patients at 37 degrees C with 5% CO(2) in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal serum and antibiotics. Activity was evaluated 120 h later by counting live microfilariae under a microscope. Cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells was estimated by measuring 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2-5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide transformation to formazan at 450 nM in a spectrophotometer. The plants tested were Lophira alata, Greenwayodendron suaveolens, Uapaca togoensis, Zanthoxylum heitzii, Peperomia pellucida, Piptadeniastrum africanum, Petersianthus macrocarpus, Vernonia conferta, and Vernonia hymenolepis. Chemical screening showed that most of the extracts contained reducing sugars, tannin or polyphenols, sterols or triterpenes, saponosides, and alkaloids. None contained carotinoids and few contained flavonoids. The 50% lethal concentration ranged from 0.22 to 70.28 microg/ml, while the 50% inhibitory concentration for eukaryotic cells (IC(50)) ranged from 8.52 to 119.52 microg/ml. Extracts of P. macrocarpus (selectivity index = 72.16), P. africanum (13.69), Z. heitzii (12.11), and L. alata (9.26) were highly selective for L. loa.	p. africanum alkaloids
2	Cinnamomum cassia Suppresses Caspase-9 through Stimulation of AKT1 in MCF-7 Cells but Not in MDA-MB-231 Cells.BACKGROUND: Cinnamomum cassia bark is a popular culinary spice used for flavoring and in traditional medicine. C. cassia extract (CE) induces apoptosis in many cell lines. In the present study, particular differences in the mechanism of the anti-proliferative property of C. cassia on two breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, were elucidated. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The hexane extract of C. cassia demonstrated high anti-proliferative activity against MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells (IC50, 34 +- 3.52 and 32.42 +- 0.37 mug/ml, respectively). Oxidative stress due to disruption of antioxidant enzyme (SOD, GPx and CAT) activity is suggested as the probable cause for apoptosis initiation. Though the main apoptosis pathway in both cell lines was found to be through caspase-8 activation, caspase-9 was also activated in MDA-MB-231 cells but suppressed in MCF-7 cells. Gene expression studies revealed that AKT1, the caspase-9 suppressor, was up-regulated in MCF-7 cells while down-regulated in MDA-MB-231 cells. Although, AKT1 protein expression in both cell lines was down-regulated, a steady increase in MCF-7 cells was observed after a sharp decrease of suppression of AKT1. Trans-cinnamaldehyde and coumarin were isolated and identified and found to be mainly responsible for the observed anti-proliferative activity of CE (Cinnamomum cassia). CONCLUSION: Activation of caspase-8 is reported for the first time to be involved as the main apoptosis pathway in breast cancer cell lines upon treatment with C. cassia. The double effects of C. cassia on AKT1 gene expression in MCF-7 cells is reported for the first time in this study.	c. cassia breast cancer
0	Asperindoles A-D and a p-Terphenyl Derivative from the Ascidian-Derived Fungus Aspergillus sp. KMM 4676.Four new indole-diterpene alkaloids asperindoles A-D (1-4) and the known p-terphenyl derivative 3&amp;Prime;-hydroxyterphenyllin (5) were isolated from the marine-derived strain of the fungus Aspergillus sp., associated with an unidentified colonial ascidian. The structures of 1-5 were established by 2D NMR and HRESIMS data. The absolute configurations of all stereocenters of 1-4 were determined by the combination of ROESY data, coupling constants analysis, and biogenetic considerations. Asperindoles C and D contain a 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid (2-HIBA) residue, rarely found in natural compounds. Asperindole A exhibits cytotoxic activity against hormone therapy-resistant PC-3 and 22Rv1, as well as hormone therapy-sensitive human prostate cancer cells, and induces apoptosis in these cells at low-micromolar concentrations.	asperindoles a pc-3 and 22rv1
1	Hepatoprotective activity of leaves of Zanthoxylum armatum DC in CCl4 induced hepatotoxicity in rats.Zanthoxylum armatum DC (Rutaceae) is extensively used in indigenous system of medicine as a tonic, carminative, stomachic and anthelmintic. In the present study, the hepatoprotective activity of the leaves ethanolic extract of Z. armatum (EEZA) was evaluated in CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity in rats. The extract at a dose of 500 mg/kg registered a significant decrease in the levels of serum glutamyl oxalacetic acid transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamyl pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase (ALKP), and serum bilurubin (SBLN) and liver inflammation, which was supported by histopathological studies on liver, thus exhibited a significant hepatoprotective activity. The phytochemical screening of defatted ethanolic extract showed the presence of sterols, alkaloids, flavonoids, and reducing sugars.	z. armatum sugars
2	Antimycobacterial, anti-inflammatory and genotoxicity evaluation of plants used for the treatment of tuberculosis and related symptoms in South Africa.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis strains and long duration of treatment has established an urgent need to search for new effective agents. The great floral diversity of South Africa has potential for producing new bioactive compounds, therefore pharmacological screening of plant extracts within this region offers much potential. To assess the in vitro antimycobacterial, anti-inflammatory and genotoxicity activity of selected plants that are used for the treatment of TB and related symptoms in South Africa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ground plant materials from 10 plants were extracted sequentially with four solvents (petroleum ether, dichloromethane, 80% ethanol and water) and a total of 68 extracts were produced. A broth microdilution method was used to screen extracts against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra. The cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme was used to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of the extracts and the Salmonella microsome assay using two Salmonella typhimurium strains (TA98 and TA100) to establish genotoxicity. RESULTS: Six out of 68 extracts showed good antimycobacterial activity. Three extracts showed good inhibition (&gt;70%) of COX-2 enzyme. All the extracts tested were non-genotoxic against the tested Salmonella strains. CONCLUSION: The results observed in this study indicate that some of the plants such as Abrus precatorius subsp. africanus, Ficus sur, Pentanisia prunelloides and Terminalia phanerophlebia could be investigated further against drug-resistant TB strains.	ficus sur tuberculosis
1	Three new compounds from Cinnamomum cassia.Three new compounds, including two new diterpenoids, named epianhydrocinnzeylanol (1) and cinnacasiol H (2), and one hydroxylasiodiplodin, (3R,4S,6R)-4,6-dihydroxy-de-O-methyllasiodiplodin (3), together with five known diterpenoids (4-8) and two known phenolic glycosides (9-10) were isolated from the barks of Cinnamomum cassia. Their structures were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analysis and comparison of the chemical shift values with those of related known compounds. The anti-inflammatory activities of the isolates were evaluated on nitric oxide production in lipopolysaccharide-induced BV-2 microglial cells and the compounds showed weak inhibition activities. 	cinnamomum cassia epianhydrocinnzeylanol
2	Mechanism of the anti-cancer activity of Zizyphus jujuba in HepG2 cells.The Zizyphus jujuba fruit has been used as a traditional Chinese medicinal herb and considered to affect various physiological functions in the body for thousands of years. However, its anti-cancer activity and mechanism of action remain to be elucidated. We investigated the anti-cancer activity of Zizyphus jujuba Mill and its underlining mechanisms of action in human hepatoma cells (HepG2) and found that the extract of Z. jujuba decreased the viability of the cells. Further extraction of the initial Z. jujuba extract with organic solvents revealed that the chloroform fraction (CHCl(3)-F) was the most effective. Interestingly, the CHCl(3)-F induced not only apoptosis but also G1 arrest at a low concentration (100 mug/ml) and G2/M arrest at a higher concentration (200 mug/ml) by cell cycle assay. Apoptosis, an increase in intracellular ROS (reactive oxygen species) level, a decline of mitochondrial membrane potential at low Z. jujuba concentrations, and a ROS-independent mitochondrial dysfunction pathway at high concentrations were all observed. CHCl(3)-F-induced G1 arrest in HepG2 cells was associated with an increase in hypohosphorylation of Rb and p27(Kip1), and a decrease of phosphorylated Rb. However, CHCl(3)-F-induced G2/M arrest in HepG2 cells correlated with a decrease of the p27(Kip1) levels and generation of the phosphorylation of p27(Kip1), however the hypohosphorylation of Rb protein remained. Collectively, our findings suggest that the CHCl(3)-F extract of Z. jujuba extract induced a concentration dependent effect on apoptosis and a differential cell cycle arrest in HepG2 cells.	z. jujuba hepatoma
1	New benzo[c]phenanthridine and benzenoid derivatives, and other constituents from Zanthoxylum ailanthoides: Effects on neutrophil pro-inflammatory responses.A new benzo[c]phenanthridine, oxynorchelerythrine (1), and two new benzenoid derivatives, methyl 4-(2-hydroxy-4-methoxy-3-methyl-4-oxobutoxy)benzoate (2) and (E)-methyl 4-(4-((Z)-3-methoxy-3-oxoprop-1-enyl)phenoxy)-2-methylbut-2-enoate (3), have been isolated from the twigs of Zanthoxylum ailanthoides, together with 11 known compounds (4-14). The structures of these new compounds were determined through spectroscopic and MS analyses. Among the isolated compounds, decarine (4), (-)-syringaresinol (6), (+)-episesamin (8), glaberide I (9), (-)-dihydrocubebin (10), and xanthyletin (11) exhibited potent inhibition (IC50 values &lt;= 4.79 microg/mL) of superoxide anion generation by human nutrophils in response to N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine/cytochalasin B (fMLP/CB). Compounds 4, 8, and 11 also inhibited fMLP/CB-induced elastase release with IC50 values &lt;= 5.48 microg/mL.	zanthoxylum ailanthoides benzo[c]phenanthridine
1	Efficient quantification of the phenolic profiles of Zanthoxylum bungeanum leaves and correlation between chromatographic fingerprint and antioxidant activity.Sixteen subsequent fractions were prepared from the ethyl acetate fraction of Zanthoxylum bungeanum leaves after bio-guided chromatographic separation. The HPLC profiles and antioxidant activity of the various fractions indicated that the content of eight phenolic compounds (chlorogenic acid, epicatechin, rutin, hyperoside, trifolin, quercitrin, afzelin and quercetin) and antioxidant activity vary significantly, and high concentrations of a combination of eight phenolic compounds would result in an increase of the antioxidant activity. These results suggested that the eight compounds could be used as chemical markers for quality assessment of Z. bungeanum leaves. Correlation between chromatographic fingerprint and antioxidant activity of the fractions showed that quercitrin and hyperoside play crucial roles in the antioxidant activity, and they can be seen as the milestone for quality control. The findings also suggested that five obtained fractions (E-3-3, E-2-4, E-7, E-5 and E-4) could become useful supplements for functional food ingredients and health-related products. 	z. bungeanum epicatechin
1	Hydrophilic interaction ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry for determination of nucleotides, nucleosides and nucleobases in Ziziphus plants.In this study, a rapid and sensitive analytical method was developed for the determination of 20 nucleobases, nucleosides and nucleotides in Ziziphus plants at trace levels by using hydrophilic interaction ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC-UHPLC-TQ-MS/MS) in multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. Under the optimized chromatographic conditions, good separation for 20 target compounds were obtained on a UHPLC Amide column with sub-2mum particles within 10min. The overall LODs and LOQs were between 0.11-3.12ngmL(-1) and 0.29-12.48ngmL(-1) for the 20 analytes, respectively. It is the first report about simultaneous analysis of nucleobases, nucleosides and nucleotides in medicinal plants using HILIC-UHPLC-TQ-MS/MS method, which affords good linearity, precision, repeatability and accuracy. The developed method was successfully applied to Ziziphus plant (Z. jujuba, Z. jujuba var. spinosa and Z. mauritiana) samples. The analysis showed that the fruits and leaves of Ziziphus plants are rich in nucleosides and nucleobases as well as nucleotides, and could be selected as the healthy food resources. Our results in present study suggest that HILIC-UHPLC-TQ-MS/MS method could be employed as a useful tool for quality assessment of the samples from the Ziziphus plants as well as other medicinal plants or food samples using nucleotides, nucleosides and nucleobases as markers. 	z. jujuba var nucleosides
2	Hydroalcoholic extract of Zizyphus jujuba ameliorates seizures, oxidative stress, and cognitive impairment in experimental models of epilepsy in rats.The anticonvulsant effect of the hydroalcoholic extract of Zizyphus jujuba (HEZJ) fruit (100, 250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg, orally) was evaluated in experimental seizure models in rats. The effect of HEZJ on seizure-induced cognitive impairment, oxidative stress, and cholinesterase activity was also investigated. HEZJ (1000 mg/kg) exhibited maximum protection (100%) against generalized tonic-clonic seizures in the pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) seizure model and and 66.7% protection against tonic hindlimb extension in the maximal electroshock (MES) seizure model. Significant impairment in cognitive functions was observed in both PTZ- and MES-challenged rats. Pretreatment with HEZJ resulted in significant improvement in learning and memory. HEZJ also reversed the oxidative stress induced by both PTZ and MES. The significant decrease in cholinesterase activity observed in the PTZ and MES models was significantly reversed by pretreatment with HEZJ. Thus, the present study demonstrates the anticonvulsant effect of HEZJ as well as amelioration of cognitive impairment induced by seizures in rats.	seizures cognitive impairment
4	Daikenchuto, a Kampo medicine, regulates intestinal fibrosis associated with decreasing expression of heat shock protein 47 and collagen content in a rat colitis model.Heat shock protein (HSP) 47 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of intestinal fibrosis. Daikenchuto (DKT), a traditional Japanese herbal (Kampo) medicine, has been reported to ameliorate intestinal inflammation. The aims of this study were to determine time-course profiles of several parameters of fibrosis in a rat model, to confirm the HSP47-expressing cells in the colon, and finally to evaluate DKT's effects on intestinal fibrosis. Colitis was induced in male Wistar rats weighing 200 g using an enema of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). HSP47 localization was determined by immunohistochemistry. Colonic inflammation and fibrosis were assessed by macroscopic, histological, morphometric, and immunohistochemical analyses. Colonic mRNA expression of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1), HSP47, and collagen type I were assessed by real time-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). DKT was administered orally once a day from 8 to 14 d after TNBS administration. The colon was removed on the 15th day. HSP47 immunoreactivity was coexpressed with alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive cells located in the subepithelial space. Intracolonic administration of TNBS resulted in grossly visible ulcers. Colonic inflammation persisted for 6 weeks, and fibrosis persisted for 4 weeks after cessation of TNBS treatment. The expression levels of mRNA and proteins for TGF-beta1, HSP47, and collagen I were elevated in colonic mucosa treated with TNBS. These fibrosis markers indicated that DKT treatment significantly inhibited TNBS-induced fibrosis. These findings suggest that DKT reduces intestinal fibrosis associated with decreasing expression of HSP47 and collagen content in the intestine.	fibrosis TGF-beta1
3	Acute demyelinating encephalitis after jequirity pea ingestion (Abrus precatorius).INTRODUCTION: Castor and jequirity beans are uncommon causes of poisoning. The more common but less severe castor poisoning is well described, but jequirity bean (Abrus Precatorius) poisoning is rare. The toxicity is attributed to toxalbumins (ricin and abrin) that act by inhibiting protein synthesis. Their use as agents of biological warfare, mechanisms of action, and clinical features of poisoning are summarized. CASE REPORT: A 30-year-old previously healthy female presented with bloody diarrhea and deep coma following ingestion of 3-4 seeds of a plant called 'ratti.' Investigations, including an MRI brain scan, showed evidence of acute demyelinating encephalitis. The patient died three days later due to progressive central nervous system depression. DISCUSSION: This is a previously unreported manifestation of jequirity bean poisoning. Demyelination is immune-mediated, and Abrus is a well-known immuno-modulator and stimulator. A possible immunological pathogenic mechanism is hypothesized.	toxalbumins jequirity bean poisoning
4	Involvement of prohibitin upregulation in abrin-triggered apoptosis.Abrin (ABR), a protein purified from the seeds of Abrus precatorius, induces apoptosis in various types of cancer cells. However, the detailed mechanism remains largely uncharacterized. By using a cDNA microarray platform, we determined that prohibitin (PHB), a tumor suppressor protein, is significantly upregulated in ABR-triggered apoptosis. ABR-induced upregulation of PHB is mediated by the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) pathway, as demonstrated by chemical inhibitors. In addition, ABR significantly induced the expression of Bax as well as the activation of caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in Jurkat T cells, whereas the reduction of PHB by specific RNA interference delayed ABR-triggered apoptosis through the proapoptotic genes examined. Moreover, our results also indicated that nuclear translocation of the PHB-p53 complex may play a role in the transcription of Bax. Collectively, our data show that PHB plays a role in ABR-induced apoptosis, which may be helpful for the development of diagnostic or therapeutic agents.	Bax tumor
1	Total flavone of Abelmoschl manihot L. medic exhibits protective effect against hind-limb ischemia in rat model.Total flavones of Abelmoschus manihot L. Medic (TFA) is the major active component isolated from Chinese herb Abelmoschus manihot L. Medic. TFA has shown neuroprotective effect against cerebral ischemia injury in rats and rabbits. However, the effects of TFA on hind-limb ischemia and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Therefore, in the present study, we used a rat hind-limb ischemia model to investigate protective effect of TFA against limb ischemia injury. The rat model of hind-limb ischemia was established. Treatment groups received TFA at two different doses (160 and 40mg/kg) daily for 10 days. Sham operated control group and model group received saline. At the end the rats were sacrificed, hindlimb tissues were stained with Haematoxylin-Eosin and Masson's trichrome. RNA and protein were extracted from tissues for PCR and Western blot analysis. The results showed that TFA reduced lower limb ischemic injury, recovered tissue volume and diminished fibrosis and muscle degeneration. Mechanistically, we showed that TFA increased the expression of anti-apoptotic factor such as Bcl-2 and survivin, decreased the expression of pro-apoptotic factor such as Caspase 3, Bax and Bak and inhibited the activation of caspase 3 and 9. In summary, this study proves new evidence that TFA protects hind-limb against ischemia injury by inhibiting apoptosis and could be a promising therapeutic agent for acute lower extremity ischemia.	abelmoschus manihot flavones
2	Evaluation of natural products on inhibition of inducible cyclooxygenase (COX-2) and nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in cultured mouse macrophage cells.The inhibitors of prostaglandin biosynthesis and nitric oxide production have been considered as potential anti-inflammatory and cancer chemopreventive agents. In this study, we evaluated approximately 170 methanol extracts of natural products including Korean herbal medicines for the inhibition of prostaglandin E(2) production (for COX-2 inhibitors) and nitric oxide formation (for iNOS inhibitors) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophages RAW264.7 cells. As a result, several extracts such as Aristolochia debilis, Cinnamomum cassia, Cinnamomum loureirii, Curcuma zedoaria, Eugenia caryophyllata, Pterocarpus santalius, Rehmania glutinosa and Tribulus terrestris showed potent inhibition of COX-2 activity (&gt;80% inhibition at the test concentration of 10 micro g/ml). In addition, the extracts of A. debilis, Caesalpinia sappan, Curcuma longa, C. zedoaria, Daphne genkwa and Morus alba were also considered as potential inhibitors of iNOS activity (&gt;70% inhibition at the test concentration of 10 micro g/ml). These active extracts mediating COX-2 and iNOS inhibitory activities are warranted for further elucidation of active principles for development of new cancer chemopreventive and/or anti-inflammatory agents.	cinnamomum cassia cancer
1	Anti-inflammatory effect of cinnamaldehyde in Helicobacter pylori induced gastric inflammation.Cinnamomum cassia is widely employed for gastrointestinal complaints such as dyspepsia, flatulence, diarrhea, and vomiting. Studies report cinnamaldehyde (CM) as a major active constituent of cinnamon. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory mechanism of CM on Helicobacter (H.) pylori-infected gastric epithelial cells in order to validate cinnamon traditional use in gastrointestinal (GI)-related disorders. AGS/MKN-45 cells and H. pylori (193C) were employed for co-culture experiments. Anti-H. pylori cytotoxic and anti-adhesion activity of CM were determined. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, real time polymerase chain reaction analysis and immunoblotting were used to measure the effect on interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion/expression. The effect on activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) was determined by immunoblot analysis. The non-cytotoxic CM (&lt;=125 microM) was also non-bactericidal at the given time, suggesting the effect in H. pylori/cell co-culture system was not due to alteration in H. pylori viability or the toxicity to the cells. Also, CM did not show any anti-adhesion effect against H. pylori/cell co-culture. However, pre-incubation of the cells with CM significantly inhibited the IL-8 secretion/expression from H. pylori-infected cells (p&lt;0.01). In addition, CM suppressed H. pylori-induced NF-kappaB activation and prevented degradation of inhibitor (I)-kappaB This study provides evidence that the anti-inflammatory effect of C. cassia on H. pylori-infected gastric cells is due to blockage of the NF-kappaB pathway by cinnamaldehyde. This agent can be considered as a potential candidate for in vivo and clinical studies against various H. pylori related gastric pathogenic processes.	c. cassia cinnamaldehyde
1	Chromium and polyphenols from cinnamon improve insulin sensitivity.Naturally-occurring compounds that have been shown to improve insulin sensitivity include Cr and polyphenols found in cinnamon (Cinnamomon cassia). These compounds also have similar effects on insulin signalling and glucose control. The signs of Cr deficiency are similar to those for the metabolic syndrome and supplemental Cr has been shown to improve all these signs in human subjects. In a double-blind placebo-controlled study it has been demonstrated that glucose, insulin, cholesterol and HbA1c are all improved in patients with type 2 diabetes following Cr supplementation. It has also been shown that cinnamon polyphenols improve insulin sensitivity in in vitro, animal and human studies. Cinnamon reduces mean fasting serum glucose (18-29%), TAG (23-30%), total cholesterol (12-26%) and LDL-cholesterol (7-27%) in subjects with type 2 diabetes after 40 d of daily consumption of 1-6 g cinnamon. Subjects with the metabolic syndrome who consume an aqueous extract of cinnamon have been shown to have improved fasting blood glucose, systolic blood pressure, percentage body fat and increased lean body mass compared with the placebo group. Studies utilizing an aqueous extract of cinnamon, high in type A polyphenols, have also demonstrated improvements in fasting glucose, glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in women with insulin resistance associated with the polycystic ovary syndrome. For both supplemental Cr and cinnamon not all studies have reported beneficial effects and the responses are related to the duration of the study, form of Cr or cinnamon used and the extent of obesity and glucose intolerance of the subjects.	cinnamon Cr
2	Hydroalcoholic extract of Zizyphus jujuba ameliorates seizures, oxidative stress, and cognitive impairment in experimental models of epilepsy in rats.The anticonvulsant effect of the hydroalcoholic extract of Zizyphus jujuba (HEZJ) fruit (100, 250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg, orally) was evaluated in experimental seizure models in rats. The effect of HEZJ on seizure-induced cognitive impairment, oxidative stress, and cholinesterase activity was also investigated. HEZJ (1000 mg/kg) exhibited maximum protection (100%) against generalized tonic-clonic seizures in the pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) seizure model and and 66.7% protection against tonic hindlimb extension in the maximal electroshock (MES) seizure model. Significant impairment in cognitive functions was observed in both PTZ- and MES-challenged rats. Pretreatment with HEZJ resulted in significant improvement in learning and memory. HEZJ also reversed the oxidative stress induced by both PTZ and MES. The significant decrease in cholinesterase activity observed in the PTZ and MES models was significantly reversed by pretreatment with HEZJ. Thus, the present study demonstrates the anticonvulsant effect of HEZJ as well as amelioration of cognitive impairment induced by seizures in rats.	seizures epilepsy
0	Cinnamaldehyde protects against oxidative stress and inhibits the TNF-alpha-induced inflammatory response in human umbilical vein endothelial cells.Oxidative stress and inflammation play critical roles in the development of cardiovascular diseases. Cinnamaldehyde (CA) is a natural compound from Cinnamomum cassia, and its anticancer, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities have been widely investigated. In the present study, the cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of CA on H2O2- or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-exposed human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were examined. CA and its natural derivative, 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde (MCA), markedly increased the cellular protein level of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and promoted the translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) to the nucleus. CA-mediated Nrf2/HO-1 activation protected the HUVECs from H2O2-induced oxidative stress, which promotes apoptosis. HO-1 depletion by siRNA attenuated the CA-mediated cell protective effects against oxidative stress. Additionally, CA markedly inhibited the adhesion of U937 monocytic cells to HUVECs by decreasing the expression level of vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM-1). An in vivo experiment confirmed the anti-inflammatory effects of CA, as lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory cell infiltration was effectively inhibited by the compound. Overall, these observations suggest that CA may be used as a therapeutic agent for oxidative stress-mediated cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis.

1	Components and insecticidal activity against the maize weevils of Zanthoxylum schinifolium fruits and leaves.In our screening program for new agrochemicals from Chinese medicinal herbs and wild plants, Zanthoxylum schinifolium essential oils were found to possess strong insecticidal activity against the maize weevil Sitophilus zeamais. The essential oils of Z. schinifolium fruits and leaves were extracted via hydrodistillation and investigated by GC and GC-MS. Estragole (69.52%) was the major compound of the essential oil of fresh fruits, followed by linalool (8.63%) and limonene (4.34%) and 94.33% of the total components were monoterpenoids. The main components of the essential oil of fresh leaves were linalool (12.94%), ar-tumerone (8.95%), limonene (6.45%) and elixene (5.43%) and only 50.62% were monoterpenoids. However, the essential oil from purchased fruits contained linalool (33.42%), limonene (13.66%) and sabinene (5.72%), followed by estragole (4.67%), nerol (4.56%) and 4-terpineol (4.27%). Estragole, linalool and sabinene were separated and purified by silica gel column chromatography and preparative thin layer chromatography, and further identified by means of physicochemical and spectrometric analysis. The essential oil from the fresh fruits (LD50 = 15.93 mug/adult) possessed two times more toxicity to the insects compared with that of fresh leaves (LD50 = 35.31 mug/adult). Estragole, linalool and sabinene exhibited contact activity against S. zeamais with LD50 values of 17.63, 13.90 and 23.98 mug/adult, respectively. The essential oils of Z. schinifolium possessed strong fumigant toxicity against S. zeamais adults with LC50 values of 13.19 mg/L (fresh fruits), 24.04 mg/L (fresh leaves) and 17.63 mg/L (purchased fruits). Estragole, linalool and sabinene also exhibited strong fumigant toxicity against the maize weevils with LC50 values of 14.10, 10.46 and 9.12 mg/L, respectively.	z. schinifolium Estragole
1	Effect of a Vietnamese Cinnamomum cassia essential oil and its major component trans-cinnamaldehyde on the cell viability, membrane integrity, membrane fluidity, and proton motive force of Listeria innocua.The antibacterial mechanism of a Cinnamomum cassia essential oil from Vietnam and of its main component (trans-cinnamaldehyde, 90% (m/m) of C. cassia essential oil) against a Listeria innocua strain was investigated to estimate their potential for food preservation. In the presence of C. cassia essential oil or trans-cinnamaldehyde at their minimal bactericidal concentration (2700 mug mL(-1)), L. innocua cells fluoresced green after staining with Syto9  and propidium iodide, as observed by epifluorescence microscopy, suggesting that the perturbation of membrane did not cause large pore formation and cell lysis but may have introduced the presence of viable but nonculturable bacteria. Moreover, the fluidity, potential, and intracellular pH of the cytoplasmic membrane were perturbed in the presence of the essential oil or trans-cinnamaldehyde. However, these membrane perturbations were less severe in the presence of trans-cinnamaldehyde than in the presence of multicomponent C. cassia essential oil. This indicates that in addition to trans-cinnamaldehyde, other minor C. cassia essential oil components play a major role in its antibacterial activity against L. innocua cells. 	c. cassia trans-cinnamaldehyde
1	Tissue-specific chemical profiling and quantitative analysis of bioactive components of Cinnamomum cassia by combining laser-microdissection with UPLC-Q/TOF-MS.BACKGROUND: Cinnamomi Cortex, the dried stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia Presl (Rougui in Chinese) has been widely used in traditional Chinese medicine, cooking and perfumery for thousands of years. Traditionally, the Cinnamomi Cortex of thick size is considered to be of good quality; however, there is no scientific data to support this point. Considering that essential oils are the main bioactive components, Cinnamomi Cortex of greater variety and amount essential oils is thought to be of better quality. In this study, laser microdissection coupled with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole/time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q/TOF-MS) was applied to profile the essential oils in different tissues of Cinnamomi Cortex and to determine if there is a correlation between the essential oil content and the stem bark thickness. RESULTS: We report the tissue-specific metabolic profiles of different grades of Cinnamomi Cortex. Nineteen chemical components were unequivocally or tentatively identified in the chromatogram of the test samples. The results indicate that the bioactive components, the essential oils, were mainly present in the phloem. CONCLUSION: Phloem thickness is the key character for evaluating the quality of Cinnamomi Cortex. Our results can be of great importance in improving the cultivation, harvesting, and processing of Cinnamomi Cortex, as well as enhancing its effects in clinical applications.	cinnamomum cassia essential oils
1	The cinnamon-derived dietary factor cinnamic aldehyde activates the Nrf2-dependent antioxidant response in human epithelial colon cells.Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of tumor-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. Recent research suggests that pharmacological intervention using dietary factors that activate the redox sensitive Nrf2/Keap1-ARE signaling pathway may represent a promising strategy for chemoprevention of human cancer including CRC. In our search for dietary Nrf2 activators with potential chemopreventive activity targeting CRC, we have focused our studies on trans-cinnamic aldehyde (cinnamaldeyde, CA), the key flavor compound in cinnamon essential oil. Here we demonstrate that CA and an ethanolic extract (CE) prepared from Cinnamomum cassia bark, standardized for CA content by GC-MS analysis, display equipotent activity as inducers of Nrf2 transcriptional activity. In human colon cancer cells (HCT116, HT29) and non-immortalized primary fetal colon cells (FHC), CA- and CE-treatment upregulated cellular protein levels of Nrf2 and established Nrf2 targets involved in the antioxidant response including heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and gamma-glutamyl-cysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS, catalytic subunit). CA- and CE-pretreatment strongly upregulated cellular glutathione levels and protected HCT116 cells against hydrogen peroxide-induced genotoxicity and arsenic-induced oxidative insult. Taken together our data demonstrate that the cinnamon-derived food factor CA is a potent activator of the Nrf2-orchestrated antioxidant response in cultured human epithelial colon cells. CA may therefore represent an underappreciated chemopreventive dietary factor targeting colorectal carcinogenesis.	cinnamomum cassia essential oil
1	Antifungal constituents of northern prickly ash, Zanthoxylum americanum mill.Leaf, fruit, stem, bark and root of Zanthoxylum americanum were investigated for antifungal activity with 11 strains of fungi representing diverse opportunistic and systemic pathogens, including Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus fumigatus. All extracts demonstrated a broad spectrum of antifungal activity and inhibited at least eight fungal species in a disk diffusion assay (600 microg/disk). Antifungal activity was light-dependent, with fruit and leaf extracts most active in general. The presence of light-mediated compounds, such as psoralen, 8-methoxypsoralen and imperatorin in extracts of different organs was confirmed by RP-HPLC. A high furanocoumarin content was detected in fruit and leaf and low furanocoumarin levels were found in bark and wood. A high positive correlation was observed between total furanocoumarin content and fungal inhibition zones (r2=0.902, p&lt;0.001). The results provide a phytochemical basis for the very widespread use of Z. americanum in indigenous North American ethnomedical tradition for conditions that may be related to fungal infections.	z. americanum 8-methoxypsoralen
3	Hydroxy-alpha-sanshool activates TRPV1 and TRPA1 in sensory neurons.Sanshools are major active ingredients of Zanthoxylum piperitum and are used as food additives in East Asia. Sanshools cause irritant, tingling and sometimes paresthetic sensations on the tongue. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the pungent or tingling sensation induced by sanshools is not known. Because many transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are responsible for the sensations induced by various spices and food additives, we expressed 17 TRP channels in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells and investigated their activation by hydroxy-alpha-sanshool (HalphaSS) or hydroxy-beta-sanshool (HbetaSS) isolated from Zanthoxylum piperitum. It was found that HalphaSS, but not HbetaSS, depolarized sensory neurons with concomitant firing of action potentials and evoked inward currents. Among 17 TRP channels expressed in HEK cells, HalphaSS caused Ca(2+) influx in cells transfected with TRPV1 or TRPA1, and evoked robust inward currents in cells transfected with TRPV1 or TRPA1. In primary cultured sensory neurons, HalphaSS induced inward currents and Ca(2+) influx in a capsazepine-dependent manner. Moreover, HalphaSS-induced currents and Ca(2+) influx were greatly diminished in TRPV1(-/-) mice. HalphaSS evoked licking behavior when injected into a single hind paw of wild-type mice, but this was much reduced in TRPV1-deficient mice. These results indicate that TRPV1 and TRPA1 are molecular targets of HalphaSS in sensory neurons. We conclude that the activations of TRPV1 and TRPA1 by HalphaSS explain its unique pungent, tingling sensation.	HalphaSS sensations
3	Effects of cassia oil on serum and hepatic uric acid levels in oxonate-induced mice and xanthine dehydrogenase and xanthine oxidase activities in mouse liver.We investigated the hypouricemic effects of cassia oil extracted from Cinnamomum cassia using hyperuricemic mice induced by potassium oxonate, and its inhibitory actions against liver xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) and xanthine oxidase (XOD) activities. Oral administration of cassia oil significantly reduced serum and hepatic urate levels in hyperuricemic mice in a time- and dose-dependent manner. At doses of 450 mg/kg of cassia oil or above, serum urate levels of the oxonate-pretreated mice were not different from the normal control mice. Cassia oil at 600 mg/kg was found to be as potent as allopurinol, which reduced hepatic urate levels to lower than normal. In normal mice, urate levels in liver, but not in serum, were altered with dose-dependent decrease after cassia oil treatment. Furthermore, the ratio, liver uric acid/serum uric acid, was determined after cassia oil administration with time- and dose-dependent decreases in hyperuricemic mice. The positive dose-dependent decrease ratio was also observed after cassia oil treatment in the normal animals. The decreased extent of ratio elicited by cassia oil in normal mice appeared to be greater than that in the hyperuricemic animal. In addition, cassia oil significantly exhibited marked reductions in liver XDH/XOD activities, with an apparent dose-dependence in the normal and hyperuricemic mice. The onset of inhibition in enzyme activities elicited by allopurinol was much higher than that elicited by cassia oil. These results suggested that hypouricemic effects of cassia oil could be explained, at least partly, by inhibiting liver in vivo activities of XDH/XOD.	hypouricemic hyperuricemic
2	The effect of medicinal plants of Islamabad and Murree region of Pakistan on insulin secretion from INS-1 cells.In vitro testing of the extracts of medicinal plants collected from Islamabad and the Murree region on insulin secretagogue activity was carried out. Dried ethanol extracts of all plants (ZH1-ZH19) were dissolved in ethanol and DMSO, and tested at various concentrations (between 1 and 40 microg/mL) for insulin release from INS-1 cells in the presence of 5.5 mM glucose. Glibenclamide was used as a control. Promising insulin secretagogue activity in various plant extracts at 1, 10, 20 and 40 microg/mL was found, while in some cases a decrease in insulin secretion was also observed. Artemisia roxburghiana, Salvia coccinia and Monstera deliciosa showed insulin secretagogue activity at 1 microg/mL (p &lt; 0.05) while Abies pindrow, Centaurea iberica and Euphorbia helioscopia were active at 10 microg/mL (p &lt; 0.05). Extracts of Bauhinia variegata and Bergenia himalacia showed effects at 20 microg/mL (p &lt; 0.05), and Taraxacum officinale and Viburnum foetens at 40 microg/mL (p &lt; 0.05). Insulin secretagogue activity could not be detected in the extracts of Adhatoda vasica, Cassia fistula, Chrysanthemum leucanthemum, Morus alba, Plectranthus rugosus, Peganum harmala and Olea ferruginea. The results suggest that medicinal plants of Islamabad and the Murree region of Pakistan may be potential natural resources for antidiabetic compounds.	euphorbia helioscopia insulin secretion
1	Three new pterocarpans from the aerial parts of Abrus Precatorius.Three new pterocarpans, named abrusprecatins A-C (1-3), along with three known ones, namely medicarpin (4), maackiain (5), and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-8,9-methylenedioxypterocarpan (6) were isolated from the aerial parts of Abrus precatorius. The structures of these compounds were established by extensive analysis of mass spectrometric data, 1 D and 2 D NMR spectroscopic data. In addition, the absolute configurations were determined by a combination of single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis and circular dichroism spectroscopy.	abrus precatorius maackiain
4	The cardioprotective effect of total flavonoids on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion in rats.The flowers of Abelmoschus manihot (L.) Medic is a traditional Chinese medicine used for the treatment of ischemic diseases. The present study is to investigate whether total flavones (TA) of extracted from Abelmoschus manihot L. Medic has the potential cardioprotective effect on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) damage in rats. The index of myocardial injury, inflammatory biomarkers and NLRP3-related parameters were measured, respectively. The results demonstrated that compared to I/R group, TA reduced myocardial infarction area, declined serum creatinine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, attenuated serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1beta and tumour necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) production. Moreover, TA markedly enhanced the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and reduced the amounts of malondialdehyde (MDA) in I/R rats. In addition, TA reduced myocardial I/R induced injury in rats by inhibiting NLRPR3 inflammasome. Thus, it is assumed that TA could significantly improve myocardial I/R injury in rats partially through suppressing NLRP3 activtion.	NLRP3 myocardial ischemia
2	Cinnamon extract induces tumor cell death through inhibition of NFkappaB and AP1.BACKGROUND: Cinnamomum cassia bark is the outer skin of an evergreen tall tree belonging to the family Lauraceae containing several active components such as essential oils (cinnamic aldehyde and cinnamyl aldehyde), tannin, mucus and carbohydrate. They have various biological functions including anti-oxidant, anti-microbial, anti-inflammation, anti-diabetic and anti-tumor activity. Previously, we have reported that anti-cancer effect of cinnamon extracts is associated with modulation of angiogenesis and effector function of CD8+ T cells. In this study, we further identified that anti-tumor effect of cinnamon extracts is also link with enhanced pro-apoptotic activity by inhibiting the activities NFkappaB and AP1 in mouse melanoma model. METHODS: Water soluble cinnamon extract was obtained and quality of cinnamon extract was evaluated by HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) analysis. In this study, we tested anti-tumor activity and elucidated action mechanism of cinnamon extract using various types of tumor cell lines including lymphoma, melanoma, cervix cancer and colorectal cancer in vitro and in vivo mouse melanoma model. RESULTS: Cinnamon extract strongly inhibited tumor cell proliferation in vitro and induced active cell death of tumor cells by up-regulating pro-apoptotic molecules while inhibiting NFkappaB and AP1 activity and their target genes such as Bcl-2, BcL-xL and survivin. Oral administration of cinnamon extract in melanoma transplantation model significantly inhibited tumor growth with the same mechanism of action observed in vitro. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that anti-tumor effect of cinnamon extracts is directly linked with enhanced pro-apoptotic activity and inhibition of NFkappaB and AP1 activities and their target genes in vitro and in vivo mouse melanoma model. Hence, further elucidation of active components of cinnamon extract could lead to development of potent anti-tumor agent or complementary and alternative medicine for the treatment of diverse cancers.	cinnamomum cassia lymphoma
2	Cinnamon and Chronic Diseases.Cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum and Cinnamon cassia), the eternal tree of tropical medicine, belongs to the Lauraceae family and is one of the most important spices used daily by people all over the world. It contains a lot of manganese, iron, dietary fiber, and calcium. Cinnamon contains derivatives, such as cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid, cinnamate, and numerous other components such as polyphenols and antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, anticancer effects. Several reports have dealt with the numerous properties of cinnamon in the forms of bark, essential oils, bark powder, and phenolic compounds, and each of these properties can play a key role in human health. Recently, many trials have explored the beneficial effects of cinnamon in Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, arthritis, and arteriosclerosis, but still we need further investigations to provide additional clinical evidence for this spice against cancer and inflammatory, cardioprotective, and neurological disorders.	cinnamon arteriosclerosis
2	Identification of CB1/CB2 ligands from Zanthoxylum bungeanum.In order to study cannabinoid receptor ligands, a novel plate-based assay was developed previously to measure internalization of CB1/CB2 receptors by determining the change in the intracellular levels of the radiolabeled agonists. This plate-based assay was also used for screening against complex matrices, specifically, in the present study screening for CB1/CB2 receptor activity of extracts for several species of the plant genus Zanthoxylum. The objective of this screen was to identify novel antagonists of the CB1 receptor, which simultaneously displayed agonist activity against the CB2 receptor, since compounds matching this criterion could be potential candidates for the treatment of type-1 diabetes. As a result, two Z. bungeanum extracts were deemed active, leading to the identification of eight compounds, of which compound 7 [(2E,4E,8E,10E,12E)-N-isobutyl-2,4,8,10,12-tetradecapentaenamide, gamma-sanshool] was obtained as a promising lead compound. 	z. bungeanum type-1 diabetes
1	Total Flavones of Abelmoschus manihot Exhibits Pro-Angiogenic Activity by Activating the VEGF-A/VEGFR2-PI3K/Akt Signaling Axis.Angiogenesis is a process of new blood vessel formation from pre-existing vessels. Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) binds to VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR2) and thus activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway play a central role in angiogenesis. Total flavones of Abelmoschus manihot (TFA), the major active component of the traditional Chinese herb Abelmoschus manihot, display novel pro-angiogenic activity. However, little information concerning its underlying mechanism is available. Here we investigate the pro-angiogenesis of TFA with the aim of understanding its mechanism of action. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model were used to evaluate pro-angiogenesis of TFA using cell viability, wounding healing, transwell invasion, tube formation, RT-qPCR and Western blot methods. LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, was used to interfere with PI3K/Akt pathway signal for assessing the underlying mechanism. Results in vitro indicated TFA obviously promoted HUVECs proliferation, migration, invasion and tube formation. Furthermore, TFA markedly augmented PI3K and Akt phosphorylation and up-regulated VEGF-A and VEGFR2 expression in HUVECs. However, pre-treatment with LY294002 not only markedly attenuated TFA-induced cells proliferation, migration, invasion and tube formation, but also significantly abolished TFA-induced VEGF-A and VEGFR2 over-expression as well as PI3K and Akt phosphorylation. Experiments in CAM model showed TFA significantly promoted the formation of branched blood vessels and was dramatically suppressed by LY294002. Taken together, TFA promoted angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo which, however, were counteracted by LY294002, suggesting at least in part, TFA exhibits pro-angiogenic activity by activating the VEGF-A/VEGFR2-PI3K/Akt signaling axis.	abelmoschus manihot flavones
1	Toxicity of Zanthoxylum piperitum and Zanthoxylum armatum oil constituents and related compounds to Stomoxys calcitrans (Diptera: Muscidae).Zanthoxylum plants (Rutaceae) have drawn attention because they contain insecticidal principles against insects. An assessment was made of the insecticidal and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activities of Zanthoxylum piperitum steam distillate and Zanthoxylum armatum seed oil, their 28 constituents, and eight structurally related compounds against female stable fly, Stomoxys calcitrans (L.). Results were compared with those of two organophosphorus insecticides chlorpyrifos and dichlorvos. Potent fumigant toxicity was observed with cuminaldehyde, thymol, (1S)-(-)-verbenone, (-)-myrtenal, carvacrol, (S)-(Z)-verbenol, Zanthoxylum piperitum steam distillate, cuminyl alcohol, Zanthoxylum armatum seed oil, piperitone, (-)-(Z)-myrtanol, and citronellal (LC50, 0.075-0.456 microg/cm3). However, they were five orders of magnitude less toxic than either chlorpyrifos or dichlorvos. An in vitro bioassay using female fly heads indicates that strong AChE inhibition was produced by citronellyl acetate, alpha-pinene, thymol, carvacrol, and alpha-terpineol (1.20-2.73 mM), but no direct correlation between fly toxicity and AChE inhibition by the test compounds was observed. Structure-activity relationships indicate that structural characteristics, such as carbon skeleton, degrees of saturation and types of functional groups, and vapor pressure parameter, appear to play a role in determining toxicities of the test monoterpenoids to stable flies. Global efforts to reduce the level of highly toxic synthetic insecticides in the agricultural environment justify further studies on Z. piperitum and Z. armatum oil-derived materials as potential insecticides for the control of stable fly populations.	z. piperitum monoterpenoids
3	Memory-enhancing effect of a supercritical carbon dioxide fluid extract of the needles of Abies koreana on scopolamine-induced amnesia in mice.Abies koreana Wilson (A. koreana) is a shrub or broadly pyramidal evergreen tree endemic in the mountainous regions of South Korea. We obtained the essential oil (EO) from alpine needle leaves of A. koreana by the supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) method. EO was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and 68 compounds were identified constituting 95.66% of the oil. The major components were elemol (11.17%), terpinen-4-ol (9.77%), sabinene (8.86%), 10(15)-cadien-4-ol (7.16%), alpha-terpineol (6.13%), alpha-pinene (6.07%) and gamma-terpinene (4.71%). To investigate the memory-enhancing effects, we conducted a passive avoidance test using a scopolamine (1 mg/kg, ip)-induced amnesia mouse model. A peritoneal injection of EO from A. koreana (100 mg/kg) showed a memory enhancing effect of 72.7% compared with the control. These results suggest that EO of A. koreana may be a useful therapeutic agent against such amnesia-inducing diseases as Alzheimer and vascular dementia.	essential oil alzheimer and vascular dementia
2	Possible attenuation of nitric oxide expression in anti-inflammatory effect of Ziziphus jujuba in rat.The hydroalcoholic extract of fruits of Ziziphus jujuba (ZJ) was investigated for its anti-inflammatory effect using acute and chronic models of inflammation in rat. Wistar albino rats of either sex were employed in the present study (n = 6). Acute inflammation was induced by subplantar administration of carrageenan (1%) in rat hind paw. Chronic inflammation was induced by interscapular implantation of a sterile cotton pellet (50 mg). ZJ extract as test drug and indomethacin (10 mg/kg) as standard were used. Serum nitrite/nitrate was also estimated to determine the expression of nitric oxide. In the acute study, carrageenan (1%) administration caused marked paw edema. Pretreatment with ZJ extract exhibited marked dose-dependent attenuation in edema compared to control. In the chronic study, interscapular implantation of sterile cotton pellets caused significant granuloma formation after 7 days, serving as control. ZJ extract significantly decreased granuloma tissue formation compared to control. The serum nitrite/nitrate level was significantly increased after 7 days in the control group due to chronic inflammation, but was decreased by ZJ extract. Moreover, phytochemical studies indicated the presence of jujubosides, flavonoids and terpenes, which may produce the marked anti-inflammatory effect of ZJ fruit in acute and chronic inflammation, possibly by inhibiting nitric oxide expression. The study provides a scientific and ethnopharmacological rationale for the therapeutic use of ZJ fruit as an anti-inflammatory agent.	ziziphus jujuba inflammation
3	The essential oil from the twigs of Cinnamomum cassia Presl inhibits oxytocin-induced uterine contraction in vitro and in vivo.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The twigs and bark of Cinnamomum cassia Presl (Lauraceae) are widely used in traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of tumor, abdominal pain, dysmenorrhea, digestive system disease and inflammatory diseases. The aim of this study was to determine the inhibitory effect of the essential oil from the twigs of Cinnamomum cassia Presl (EOCC) on uterine contraction in vitro and in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mouse uterine contraction was induced by oxytocin (OT) exposure following estradiol benzoate pretreatment. Mice were given the EOCC (60, 30, and 15mg/kg) by gavage. The level of prostaglandin F2alpha (PGF2alpha) in uterine tissue were determined according to specification of enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. Uterine tissue was collected for histopathological analysis (H&amp;E). Myosin light chain 20 (MLC20), phosphorylation of myosin light chain 20 (p-MLC20) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) proteins in uterine tissue were assessed by Western Blot. Mouse isolated uterus strips were mounted in tissue organ baths containing Locke's solution. The contractile responses were recorded with Power Lab recording system. The effect of the EOCC on uterine contraction induced by OT, PGF2alpha, and acetylcholine (Ach) was observed. Myometrial cells were exposed to OT (7muM) to induce Ca2+ release, and the effect of the EOCC (100, 50, and 25mug/ml) on intracellular Ca2+ was analysed with fluorometry imaging. RESULTS: In vivo study demonstrated that the EOCC significantly reduced OT-induced writhing responses with a maximal inhibition of 66.5%. It also decreased the level of PGF2alpha in OT-induced mice uterine tissue. Moreover, Western blot analysis showed that COX-2 and p-MLC20 expressions in uterine tissue of dysmenorrhea mice were significantly reduced. EOCC inhibited spontaneous uterus contractions in a dose-dependent manner, and the concentration of the EOCC giving 50% of maximal contraction (IC50) value was 61.3mug/ml. The IC50 values of the EOCC on OT, PGF2alpha, and Ach-induced contractions were 113.0mug/ml, 94.7mug/ml, and 61.5mug/ml, respectively. Further in vitro studies indicated that the EOCC could restrain intracellular Ca2+ levels in favour of uterine relaxation. CONCLUSION: Both in vivo and in vitro results suggest that the EOCC possesses significant spasmolytic effect on uterine contraction. Thus, the EOCC yields a possible therapeutic choice for the prevention and treatment of primary dysmenorrhea.	essential oil primary dysmenorrhea
2	Cell penetrating peptides from agglutinin protein of Abrus precatorius facilitate the uptake of Imatinib mesylate.Targeted drug delivery is of paramount importance for cancer patients. Cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) have emerged as potent vehicles for this purpose. Herein, we demonstrate CPP- like properties of two peptides: NH2-SGASDDEEIAR-COOH (SR11) and NH2-ICSSHYEPTVRIGGR-COOH (IR15), derived from the tryptic digest of Abrus precatorius agglutinin. Both IR15 and SR11 were found to be non-toxic at lower doses (up to 50 mug/ml). These two peptides entered into HeLa cells through lipid raft-mediated endocytosis within 15 min and penetrated the nuclear membrane in 60 min of incubation. Co-treatment of peptides (20 mug/ml) and Imatinib (5 muM) in HeLa cells increased uptake of the drug by ~ 55% and lowered the IC50 value to one-third in comparison to the drug added exclusively. However, co-treatment of TAT peptide (standard CPP) did not alter the Imatinib uptake significantly. In summary, we have identified two novel CPPs from tryptic digest of Abrus agglutinin which increased the cellular uptake of Imatinib upon co-administration. Further studies may result in deciphering a novel mode of drug delivery.	abrus precatorius cancer
3	Potentiation of antifungal activity of amphotericin B by essential oil from Cinnamomum cassia.The antifungal activity of the essential oil from Cinnamomum cassia, alone or combined with amphotericin B, a drug widely used for most indications despite side-effects was investigated. The composition of the oil was analysed by GC/MS and characterized by its very high content of cinnamaldehyde (92.2%). The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC 80%), used to evaluate the antifungal activity against Candida albicans, was determined by a macrobroth dilution method followed by a modelling of fungal growth. The essential oil of Cinnamomum cassia exhibited strong antifungal effect (MIC 80% = 0.169 microL/mL and K(aff) = 18,544 microL/mL). A decrease of the MIC 80% of amphotericin B was obtained when the culture medium contained essential oil concentrations ranging from 0.08 to 0.1 microL/mL. The strongest decrease (70%) was obtained when the medium contained 0.1 microL/mL of essential oil. This potentiation of amphotericin B obtained in vitro may show promise for the development of less toxic and more effective therapies especially for the treatment of HIV infection.	cinnamaldehyde hiv infection
2	Evaluation of natural products on inhibition of inducible cyclooxygenase (COX-2) and nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in cultured mouse macrophage cells.The inhibitors of prostaglandin biosynthesis and nitric oxide production have been considered as potential anti-inflammatory and cancer chemopreventive agents. In this study, we evaluated approximately 170 methanol extracts of natural products including Korean herbal medicines for the inhibition of prostaglandin E(2) production (for COX-2 inhibitors) and nitric oxide formation (for iNOS inhibitors) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophages RAW264.7 cells. As a result, several extracts such as Aristolochia debilis, Cinnamomum cassia, Cinnamomum loureirii, Curcuma zedoaria, Eugenia caryophyllata, Pterocarpus santalius, Rehmania glutinosa and Tribulus terrestris showed potent inhibition of COX-2 activity (&gt;80% inhibition at the test concentration of 10 micro g/ml). In addition, the extracts of A. debilis, Caesalpinia sappan, Curcuma longa, C. zedoaria, Daphne genkwa and Morus alba were also considered as potential inhibitors of iNOS activity (&gt;70% inhibition at the test concentration of 10 micro g/ml). These active extracts mediating COX-2 and iNOS inhibitory activities are warranted for further elucidation of active principles for development of new cancer chemopreventive and/or anti-inflammatory agents.	a. debilis cancer
1	Purification and characterization of flavonoids from the leaves of Zanthoxylum bungeanum and correlation between their structure and antioxidant activity.Nine flavonoids were isolated and characterized from the leaves of Zanthoxylum bungeanum. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic techniques as quercetin (1), afzelin (2), quercitrin (3), trifolin (4), quercetin-3-O-beta-D-glucoside (5), isorhamnetin 3-O-alpha-L-rhamnoside (6), hyperoside (7), vitexin (8) and rutin (9). All compounds were isolated from the leaves of Z. bungeanum for the first time. Five compounds (2, 4, 5, 6 and 8) were found for the first time in the genus Zanthoxylum. To learn the mechanisms underlying its health benefits, in vitro (DPPH, ABTS, FRAP and lipid peroxidation inhibition assays) and in vivo (protective effect on Escherichia coli under peroxide stress) antioxidant activities of the nine flavonoids were measured. Quercetin and quercetin glycosides (compounds 1, 3, 5, 7, 9) showed the highest antioxidant activity. Structure-activity relationships indicated that the -OH in 4' position on the B ring and the -OH in 7 position on the A ring possessed high antioxidant activity; B ring and/or A ring with adjacent -OH groups could greatly increase their antioxidant ability. Also, due to the different structures of various flavonoids, they will certainly exhibit different antioxidant capacity when the reactions occur in solution or in oil-in-water emulsion. These findings suggest that Z. bungeanum leaves may have health benefits when consumed. It could become a useful supplement for pharmaceutical products and functional food ingredients in both nutraceutical and food industries as a potential source of natural antioxidants. 	z. bungeanum quercetin glycosides
1	Apoptogenic activity of auraptene of Zanthoxylum schinifolium toward human acute leukemia Jurkat T cells is associated with ER stress-mediated caspase-8 activation that stimulates mitochondria-dependent or -independent caspase cascade.To isolate pharmacologically safe compounds that can induce apoptosis of tumor cells, leaves of an aromatic plant (Zanthoxylum schinifolium), which are widely used as a food flavor and herbal medicine in Korea and Japan, were sequentially extracted by organic solvents. An apoptogenic ingredient in the methylene chloride extract was further purified by silica gel column chromatography and identified as auraptene (AUR). The IC(50) value of AUR against Jurkat T cells was 16.5 microg/ml. After the treatment of Jurkat T cells with AUR, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated activation of caspase-12 and -8 and subsequent apoptotic events including c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, cleavage of FLICE inhibitory protein and Bid, mitochondrial cytochrome c release, activation of caspase-9 and -3, degradation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and apoptotic DNA fragmentation were induced in a dose-dependent manner. The cytotoxicity of AUR was not blocked by the anti-Fas neutralizing antibody ZB-4. The AUR-induced cytotoxicity and apoptotic events were abrogated by ectopic over-expression of Bcl-xL or addition of the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. The individual or simultaneous addition of the m-calpain inhibitor (E64d), JNK inhibitor (SP600125) and mitochondrial permeability transition pore inhibitor (CsA) failed to prevent apoptotic events including caspase-8 activation and Bid cleavage, unless the caspase-8 inhibitor (z-IETD-fmk) was combined, whereas AUR-induced caspase-12 activation was sustained even in the concomitant presence of z-IETD-fmk. These results demonstrated that the apoptotic effect of AUR on Jurkat T cells was exerted by the ER stress-mediated activation of caspase-8, and the subsequent induction of mitochondria-dependent or -independent activation of caspase cascade, which could be suppressed by Bcl-xL.	zanthoxylum schinifolium AUR
1	A new isoflavone glycoside from Abrus cantoniensis.A new isoflavone glycoside named as 8-O-methylrelusin-7-O-beta-D-apifuranosyl-(1 2)-beta-D-glucopyranoside (1), together with two known compounds, 8-O-methylrelusin-7-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (2) and isobiflorin (3), were isolated from Abrus cantoniensis. The structure of the new compound was elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic methods including extensive 1D NMR, 2D NMR, and HRESIMS. This is the first report of isoflavone from Abrus cantoniensis. Moreover, all isolated compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxicity against SMMC-7721 and MHCC97-H cell lines.	abrus cantoniensis isoflavone glycoside
1	Cloning of TPS gene from eelgrass species Zostera marina and its functional identification by genetic transformation in rice.The full-length cDNA sequence (2613 bp) of the trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) gene of eelgrass Zostera marina (ZmTPS) was identified and cloned. Z. marina is a kind of seed-plant growing in sea water during its whole life history. The open reading frame (ORF) region of ZmTPS gene encodes a protein of 870 amino acid residues and a stop codon. The corresponding genomic DNA sequence is 3770 bp in length, which contains 3 exons and 2 introns. The ZmTPS gene was transformed into rice variety ZH11 via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation method. After antibiotic screening, molecular characterization, salt-tolerance and trehalose content determinations, two transgenic lines resistant to 150 mM NaCL solutions were screened. Our study results indicated that the ZmTPS gene was integrated into the genomic DNA of the two transgenic rice lines and could be expressed well. Moreover, the detection of the transformed ZmTPS gene in the progenies of the two transgenic lines was performed from T1 to T4 generations; and results suggested that the transformed ZmTPS gene can be transmitted from parent to the progeny in transgenic rice.	z. marina trehalose
2	[Anthelmintic activity of aqueous extract of Zanthoxylum rhoifolium Lam. leaves (Rutaceae)].The study evaluated the anthelmintic activity of aqueous extract of Zanthoxylum rhoifolium leaves in two experiments. In vitro test, cultures of goat fecal samples were treated with different concentrations of extract (134.5 to 335.0 mg.mL(-1)). In vivo test was composed of 20 sheep: G1: treated with 0.63 g.kg(-1), during four days; G2: same dose, for eight days; G3: ivermectin (200 microg.kg(-1)) and G4 untreated group. In vitro results showed a reduction of Haemonchus spp, Trichostrongylus spp. and Oesophagostomum spp. larvae greater than 95% in the concentrations between 335.0 and 193.7 mg.mL(-1). Faecal egg counting reduction was 51, 56 and 90% in G1, G2 and G3, respectively, while immature stages and adults ranged from 0 to 91% in G1 and from 26 to 94% in G2. Ivermectin effectiveness was 99% for L4 and L5 of H. contortus and 100% for other nematodes species. Clinical and biochemical parameters have remained in the normality and histophatologic analyses did not show alteration suggesting absence of toxicity. Although the great effectiveness of Z. rhoifolium leaves extract in vitro test, it displayed poor efficiency in vivo regarding gastrointestinal nematodes reduction.	z. rhoifolium gastrointestinal nematodes reduction
1	The chemical composition and nutritional potential of the tribal pulse, Abrus precatorius L.The boiled seeds of Abrus precatorius L. are eaten by the residents of the Andaman Islands in India. The seeds were analysed for proximate composition, total (true) protein, seed protein fractions, amino acid profile of seed proteins, minerals and certain antinutritional factors. The seed proteins are rich in most of the essential amino acids, and they are deficient only in cystine and threonine, when compared to the WHO/FAO requirement pattern. The antinutritional factors (total free phenols, tannins, trypsin inhibitor activity and haemagglutinating activity) were also investigated.	abrus precatorius essential amino acids
1	Toxicity of Zanthoxylum piperitum and Zanthoxylum armatum oil constituents and related compounds to Stomoxys calcitrans (Diptera: Muscidae).Zanthoxylum plants (Rutaceae) have drawn attention because they contain insecticidal principles against insects. An assessment was made of the insecticidal and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activities of Zanthoxylum piperitum steam distillate and Zanthoxylum armatum seed oil, their 28 constituents, and eight structurally related compounds against female stable fly, Stomoxys calcitrans (L.). Results were compared with those of two organophosphorus insecticides chlorpyrifos and dichlorvos. Potent fumigant toxicity was observed with cuminaldehyde, thymol, (1S)-(-)-verbenone, (-)-myrtenal, carvacrol, (S)-(Z)-verbenol, Zanthoxylum piperitum steam distillate, cuminyl alcohol, Zanthoxylum armatum seed oil, piperitone, (-)-(Z)-myrtanol, and citronellal (LC50, 0.075-0.456 microg/cm3). However, they were five orders of magnitude less toxic than either chlorpyrifos or dichlorvos. An in vitro bioassay using female fly heads indicates that strong AChE inhibition was produced by citronellyl acetate, alpha-pinene, thymol, carvacrol, and alpha-terpineol (1.20-2.73 mM), but no direct correlation between fly toxicity and AChE inhibition by the test compounds was observed. Structure-activity relationships indicate that structural characteristics, such as carbon skeleton, degrees of saturation and types of functional groups, and vapor pressure parameter, appear to play a role in determining toxicities of the test monoterpenoids to stable flies. Global efforts to reduce the level of highly toxic synthetic insecticides in the agricultural environment justify further studies on Z. piperitum and Z. armatum oil-derived materials as potential insecticides for the control of stable fly populations.	z. piperitum alpha-pinene
2	Agrimonia pilosa Ledeb., Cinnamomum cassia Blume, and Lonicera japonica Thunb. protect against cognitive dysfunction and energy and glucose dysregulation by reducing neuroinflammation and hippocampal insulin resistance in beta-amyloid-infused rats.OBJECTIVES: The water extracts of Cinnamomum cassia Blume bark (CCB; Lauraceae), Lonicera japonica Thunb. flower (LJT; Caprifoliaceae), and Agrimonia pilosa Ledeb. leaves (APL; Rosaceae) prevented amyloid-beta (25-35)-induced cell death in PC12 cells in our preliminary study. We evaluated whether long-term oral consumption of CCB, LJT, and APL improves cognitive dysfunction and glucose homeostasis in rats with experimentally induced AD-type dementia. METHODS: Male rats received hippocampal CA1 infusions of amyloid-beta (25-35, AD) or amyloid-beta (35-25, non-plaque forming, normal-controls, Non-AD-CON), at a rate of 3.6 nmol/day for 14 days. AD rats were divided into four groups receiving either 2% lyophilized water extracts of CCB, LJT, or APL or 2% dextrin (AD-CON) in high-fat diets (43% energy as fat). RESULTS: Hippocampal amyloid-beta deposition, tau phosphorylation, and expressions of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (neruoinflammation markers) were increased, and insulin signaling decreased in AD-CON. CCB, LJT, and APL all prevented hippocampal amyloid-beta accumulation and enhanced hippocampal insulin signaling. CCB, LJT, and APL decreased TNF-alpha and iNOS in the hippocampus and especially APL exhibited the greatest decrease. AD-CON exhibited cognitive dysfunction in passive avoidance and water maze tests, whereas CCB, LJT, and APL protected against cognitive dysfunction, and APL was most effective and was similar to Non-AD-CON. AD-CON had less fat oxidation as an energy fuel, but it was reversed by CCB, LJT, and especially APL. APL-treated rats had less visceral fat than AD-CON rats. AD-CON rats exhibited impaired insulin sensitivity and increased insulin secretion during oral glucose tolerance test compared with Non-AD-CON, but CCB and APL prevented the impairment. DISCUSSION: These results supported that APL, LJT, and CCB effectively prevent the cognitive dysfunction and the impairment of energy and glucose homeostasis induced by amyloid-beta deposition by reducing neuroinflammation and enhancing insulin signaling. APL exhibited the greatest effectiveness for improving cognitive function.	agrimonia pilosa ledeb cognitive dysfunction
1	Xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity of constituents of Cinnamomum cassia twigs.A methanol extract of the twigs of Cinnamomum cassia was found to inhibit xanthine oxidase. Purification of the methanol extract afforded three new phenolic glycosides, cinnacasolide A-C (11-13), together with 10 known compounds (1-10). The structures of the three new compounds were determined by interpretation of spectroscopic data. Cinnamaldehyde derivatives 1-5 and 7 were significant inhibitors of xanthine oxidase, with IC(50) values ranging from 7.8 to 36.3 mug/mL. The results indicate that the acyl group of these cinnamaldehyde derivatives plays an important role in the inhibition of xanthine oxidase.	cinnamomum cassia cinnacasolide a-c
2	In vivo antitrypanosomal effects of some ethnomedicinal plants from Nupeland of north central Nigeria.Four medicinal plants Acacia nilotica, Bombax buonopozense, Terminalia avicennioides and Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides traditionally used for treatment of sleeping sickness in Nupeland were investigated for in vivo antitrypanosomal activity. Methanol extracts of different parts of each plant (stem barks and fruits) were obtained and evaluated for their in vivo antitrypanosomal activities against Trypanosoma brucei brucei. Phytochemical screening of the methanol extracts of each plant were performed by standard procedures. Methanol extracts of A. nilotica (stem bark), B. buonopozense (stem bark), T. avicennioides (round fruit) and Z. zanthoxyloides (stem bark) were effective on trypanosomes. The extracts of A. nilotica and B. buonopozense exhibited antitrypanosomal effects at 200 and 300 mg/kg body weight respectively. Doses were able to clear the parasites from circulation within 6 and 7 days of treatment respectively with prolonging survival period of up to 30 days. While the extracts of T. avicennioides and Z. zanthoxyloides showed trypanostatic effects and could not clear the parasites completely. The methanol extracts of these plants contain metabolites that are associated with antitrypanosomal effects; therefore, these medicinal plants may be sources of new compounds that may be active against T. b. brucei. This study has also justified the claim that some medicinal plants of Nupeland possess antitrypanosomal activity and could be useful in the management of trypanosomiasis.	b. buonopozense trypanosomiasis
2	The Fas/Fas ligand apoptotic pathway is involved in abrin-induced apoptosis.Abrin is a plant glycoprotein toxin from the seeds of Abrus precatorius, sharing similarity in structure and properties with ricin. Abrin is highly toxic, with an estimated human fatal dose of 0.1-1 microg/kg, causing death after accidental or intentional poisoning. It is a potent biological toxin warfare agent. There is no chemical antidote available against the abrin. The elucidation of molecular mechanism of abrin-induced cell death is important for development of therapy. Intrinsic pathway-mediated apoptosis has been well established in abrin-induced cell death. However, the detailed mechanism especially extrinsic receptor-mediated pathway remains uncharacterized. To assess whether some of the apoptosis known to occur after abrin exposure might be mediated by Fas/Fas ligand (Fas L) interactions, we analyzed effect of abrin on Fas pathway in Jurkat cells. Here, we report that activation of the Fas pathway is involved in abrin-induced apoptosis. Following treatment of abrin, Fas L was induced, which stimulated the Fas pathway by cross-linking Fas receptor (Fas R). Apoptosis was mediated by cleavage of the Fas R proximal caspase-8 and the downstream caspase-3, resulting in activation of the prototype caspase substrate poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase and caspase-activated DNase. Blocking Fas L/Fas R interaction by using Fas inhibitor reduced abrin-induced apoptosis, further confirms involvement of Fas pathway. Activation of components of Fas pathway and caspases upon abrin treatment was also found in splenocytes in mice. Our findings offer new perspective for understanding the fundamental mechanism in abrin-induced apoptotic mechanism and may have implication in developing novel therapeutic strategies in the management for abrin-induced complications. 	abrus precatorius poisoning
1	Synthesis and in vitro cytotoxicity of cinnamaldehydes to human solid tumor cells.Cinnamaldehydes and related compounds were synthesized from various cinnamic acids based on the 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde isolated from the bark of Cinnamomum cassia Blume. The cytotoxicity to human solid tumor cells such as A549, SK-OV-3, SK-MEL-2, XF498 and HCT15 were measured. Cinnamic acid, cinnamates and cinnamyl alcohols did not show any cytotoxicity against the human tumor cells. Cinnamaldehydes and related compounds were resistant to A549 cell line up to 15 micrograms/ml. In contrast, HCT15 and SK-MEL-2 cells were much sensitive to these cinnamaldehyde analogues which showed ED50 values 0.63-8.1 micrograms/ml. Cytotoxicity of the saturated aldehydes was much weak compared to their unsaturated aldehydes. From these studies, it was found that the key functional group of the cinnamaldehyde-related compounds in the antitumor activity is the propenal group.	cinnamomum cassia 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde
1	In silico investigation of potential pyruvate kinase M2 regulators from traditional Chinese medicine against cancers.A recent research in cancer research demonstrates that tumor-specific pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) plays an important role in chromosome segregation and mitosis progression of tumor cells. To improve the drug development of TCM compounds, we aim to identify potent TCM compounds as lead compounds of PKM2 regulators. PONDR-Fit protocol was utilized to predict the disordered disposition in the binding domain of PKM2 protein before virtual screening as the disordered structure in the protein may cause the side effect and downregulation of the possibility of ligand to bind with target protein. MD simulation was performed to validate the stability of interactions between PKM2 proteins and each ligand after virtual screening. The top TCM compounds, saussureamine C and precatorine, extracted from Lycium chinense Mill. and Abrus precatorius L., respectively, have higher binding affinities with target protein in docking simulation than control. They have stable H-bonds with residues A:Lys311 and some other residues in both chains of PKM2 protein. Hence, we propose the TCM compounds, saussureamine C and precatorine, as potential candidates as lead compounds for further study in drug development process with the PKM2 protein against cancer. 	abrus precatorius saussureamine c
1	Lifting properties of the alkamide fraction from the fruit husks of Zanthoxylum bungeanum.The fruits of various Zanthoxylum species are used as a spice in the Chinese and Japanese cuisine because of their delicate flavour and tingling properties. The lipophilic hydroxyalkamides hydroxy alpha- and beta-sanshools (1a,b) have been identified as the tingling principles of these plants, and previous studies have validated a sanshool-rich lipophilic extract from the fruit husks of Z. bungeanum Maxim. (Zanthalene   ) as an anti-itching cosmetic ingredient. Because tingling is a sort of 'paralytic pungency', and Zanthalene   potently inhibits synaptic transmission, we have investigated its capacity to relax subcutaneous muscles and act as a topical lifting agent for wrinkles. An anti-wrinkles extract rich in spilanthol (2), a lipophilic alkamide having sensory properties similar to those of Zanthalene   , was used as a reference. Short-term (lifting effect) and long-term (anti-wrinkle) improvements of skin roughness parameters were evaluated by both objectives' and subjectives' measurements. An immediate 'lifting' effect was observed with the sanshool-rich lipophilic extract, at dosages at which the reference alkamide extract was inactive in the objective assays. Limited desensitization after repeated application and good overall tolerability were observed, although a modest long-term anti-wrinkle effect was shown by both products. Taken together, these observations validate the use of sanshool-rich lipophilic extracts as an efficacious, immediate-action lifting agent, and exemplify the relevance of sensory observations to foster the development of innovative cosmetic ingredients.	z. bungeanum maxim alkamide
1	Cinnamomum cassia essential oil and its major constituent cinnamaldehyde induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human oral squamous cell carcinoma HSC-3 cells.Cinnamomum cassia essential oil (CC-EO) has various functional properties, such as anti-microbial, hypouricemic, anti-tyrosinase and anti-melanogenesis activities. The present study aimed to evaluate the anti-cancer activities of CC-EO and its major constituent, cinnamaldehyde, in human oral squamous cell carcinoma HSC-3 cells. Determination of the cell viability, apoptotic characteristics, DNA damage, cell cycle analysis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial membrane potential, cytosolic Ca2+ level and intracellular redox status were performed. Our results demonstrated that CC-EO and cinnamaldehyde significantly decreased cell viability and caused morphological changes. The cell cycle analysis revealed that CC-EO and cinnamaldehyde induced G2/M cell cycle arrest in HSC-3 cells. The apoptotic characteristics (DNA laddering and chromatin condensation) and DNA damage were observed in the CC-EO-treated and cinnamaldehyde-treated HSC-3 cells. Moreover, CC-EO and cinnamaldehyde promoted an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ levels, induced mitochondrial dysfunction and activated cytochrome c release. The results of ROS production and intracellular redox status demonstrated that CC-EO and cinnamaldehyde significantly increased the ROS production and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance levels, and the cellular glutathione content and glutathione peroxidase activity were significantly reduced in HSC-3 cells. Our results suggest that CC-EO and cinnamaldehyde may possess anti-oral cancer activity in HSC-3 cells.   2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

3	Extraction of Flavonoids from the Flowers of Abelmoschus manihot (L.) Medic by Modified Supercritical CO2 Extraction and Determination of Antioxidant and Anti-Adipogenic Activity.Abelmoschus manihot (L.) Medic has been used for many years in Chinese traditional medicine. In this study, supercritical CO2 plus a modifier was utilized to extract flavonoids from the flowers of Abelmoschus manihot (L.) Medic. The effects of temperature (40  C-60  C), pressure (10-30 MPa) and different concentrations of ethanol as modifier (60%-90%, ethanol:water, v/v) on major flavonol content and the antioxidant activity of the extracts were studied by response surface methodology (RSM) using a Box-Behnken design. The flavonol content was calculated as the sum of the concentrations of seven major flavonoids, namely rutin, hyperin, isoquercetin, hibifolin, myricetin, quercetin-3'-O-glucoside and quercetin, which were simultaneously determined by a HPLC method. The antioxidant activity was evaluated by a 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydarzyl (DPPH) free radical-scavenging assay. The results showed that three factors and their interactions could be well fitted to second-order polynomial models (p &lt; 0.05). At the optimal extraction conditions for flavonol content (20 MPa, 52  C, and 85% ethanol content), the yield of flavonoids was 41.96 mg/g and the IC50 value was 0.288 mg/mL, respectively, suggesting the extract has high antioxidant activity. Furthermore, the anti-adipogenic activity of the extract on the 3T3-L1 cell line was investigated. The results indicated that it can downregulate PPARgamma and C/EBPalpha expression at mRNA. In summary, in this study, we have established a cost-effective method for the extraction of flavonoids from the flowers of Abelmoschus manihot (L.) Medic using supercritical fluid extraction and the extracts exhibited potent antioxidant and anti-adipogenic effects, suggesting a possible therapeutic approach for the prevention and treatment of obesity. 	flavonoids obesity
2	In vitro anti-Helicobacter pylori action of 30 Chinese herbal medicines used to treat ulcer diseases.Infection by Helicobacter pylori has been ascertained to be an important etiologic impetus leading usually to chronic active gastritis and gastric ulcer with growing incidences worldwide. Utilizing as the test pathogen a standard and five clinic strains of Helicobacter pylori, the antibacterial action was assessed in vitro with ethanol extracts of 30 Chinese herbal medicines which have been frequently prescribed since ancient times for treating gastritis-like disorders. Among the 30 tested materials, the ethanol extracts of Abrus cantoniensis (Fabaceae), Saussurea lappa (Asteraceae) and Eugenia caryophyllata (Myrtaceae) were strongly inhibitory to all test strains (MICs: approximately 40 microg/ml), and Hippophae rhamnoides (Elaeagnaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii (Liliaceae), Magnolia officinalis and Schisandra chinensis (Magnoliaceae), Corydalis yanhusuo (Papaveraceae), Citrus reticulata (Rutaceae), Bupleurum chinense and Ligusticum chuanxiong (Apiaceae) substantially active with MICs close to 60.0 microg/ml. As to antibacterial actions of the aqueous extracts of the same drugs, those derived from Cassia obtusifolia (Fabaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii and Eugenia caryophyllata were remarkably inhibitory against all the six Helicobacter pylori strains (MICs: approximately 60 microg/ml). The work compared almost quantitatively the magnitude of the anti-Helicobacter pylori actions of the 30 most prescribed gastritis-treating Chinese herbal drugs, and located as well some source plants where potent anti-Helicobacter pylori phytochemicals could be characterized.	hippophae rhamnoides ulcer diseases
4	Zanthoxyli Fructus induces growth arrest and apoptosis of LNCaP human prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo in association with blockade of the AKT and AR signal pathways.Zanthoxyli Fructus belongs to the family of oranges and is used as a seasoning in Asian countries including Japan. This study found that a water extract of Zanthoxyli Fructus possessed anti-tumor activity against a wide variety of cancer cells including those from prostate (LNCaP, DU145, PC-3), breast (MCF-7, T47D, MDA-MB231), lung (NCI-H460, -H520), as well as leukemia (HL-60, NB4, Jurkat) in vitro, as measured by the trypan blue exclusion test. Importantly, Zanthoxyli Fructus slowed the proliferation of LNCaP, DU145, and MDA-MB231 cells present as xenografts in BALB/c nude mice without adverse effects. Further studies explored the molecular mechanism by which Zanthoxyli Fructus inhibited the proliferation of androgen-dependent human prostate cancer LNCaP cells because Zanthoxyli Fructus possessed the strongest anti-tumor activity against these cells. Zanthoxyli Fructus blocked androgen receptor (AR) signaling in conjunction with down-regulation of nuclear levels of AR and induced apoptosis of these cells, as measured by the reporter assay, Western blot analysis, and TUNEL assay, respectively. As expected, Zanthoxyli Fructus also decreased the level of the AR-target molecule, prostate-specific antigen in these cells. Furthermore, Zanthoxyli Fructus inhibited AKT kinase and down-regulated levels of cyclin D1 protein, as measured by the AKT kinase assay with GSK-3alpha/beta as a substrate and Western blot analysis, respectively. Taken together, Zanthoxyli Fructus might be useful as an adjunctive therapeutic agent for the treatment of individuals with a variety of cancer types.	cyclin d1 prostate cancer
2	An Arrow Poison (Abrus Precatorius) Causing Fatal Poisoning in a Child.Ingestion of whole seeds of Abrus precatorius often does not produce serious illness. It generally presents initially with gastrointestinal manifestations. Haemolysis, acute renal damage, hepatotoxicity and seizures are the other manifestations. Herewith we report a child with accidental ingestion of abrus precatorius seeds who presented with altered sensorium and convulsions. The case is being reported on account of its rarity in its initial neurological manifestation and has not been reported earlier in paediatric age group. 	abrus precatorius convulsions
1	Jubanines F-J, cyclopeptide alkaloids from the roots of Ziziphus jujuba.Five Ib-type cyclopeptide alkaloids, jubanines F-J (1-5), and three known compounds, nummularine B (6), daechuine-S3 (7), and mucronine K (8) were isolated from the roots of Ziziphus jujuba. Their structures were fully characterized by spectroscopic analyses in combination with chemical derivatization. Compounds 1-3, and 6 were evaluated for their antiviral activity against the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). Compounds 2, 3, and 6 showed potent inhibitory effects on PEDV replication. 	ziziphus jujuba alkaloids
1	Possible attenuation of nitric oxide expression in anti-inflammatory effect of Ziziphus jujuba in rat.The hydroalcoholic extract of fruits of Ziziphus jujuba (ZJ) was investigated for its anti-inflammatory effect using acute and chronic models of inflammation in rat. Wistar albino rats of either sex were employed in the present study (n = 6). Acute inflammation was induced by subplantar administration of carrageenan (1%) in rat hind paw. Chronic inflammation was induced by interscapular implantation of a sterile cotton pellet (50 mg). ZJ extract as test drug and indomethacin (10 mg/kg) as standard were used. Serum nitrite/nitrate was also estimated to determine the expression of nitric oxide. In the acute study, carrageenan (1%) administration caused marked paw edema. Pretreatment with ZJ extract exhibited marked dose-dependent attenuation in edema compared to control. In the chronic study, interscapular implantation of sterile cotton pellets caused significant granuloma formation after 7 days, serving as control. ZJ extract significantly decreased granuloma tissue formation compared to control. The serum nitrite/nitrate level was significantly increased after 7 days in the control group due to chronic inflammation, but was decreased by ZJ extract. Moreover, phytochemical studies indicated the presence of jujubosides, flavonoids and terpenes, which may produce the marked anti-inflammatory effect of ZJ fruit in acute and chronic inflammation, possibly by inhibiting nitric oxide expression. The study provides a scientific and ethnopharmacological rationale for the therapeutic use of ZJ fruit as an anti-inflammatory agent.	ziziphus jujuba terpenes

Utilizing as the test pathogen a standard and five clinic strains of Helicobacter pylori, the antibacterial action was assessed in vitro with ethanol extracts of 30 Chinese herbal medicines which have been frequently prescribed since ancient times for treating gastritis-like disorders. Among the 30 tested materials, the ethanol extracts of Abrus cantoniensis (Fabaceae), Saussurea lappa (Asteraceae) and Eugenia caryophyllata (Myrtaceae) were strongly inhibitory to all test strains (MICs: approximately 40 microg/ml), and Hippophae rhamnoides (Elaeagnaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii (Liliaceae), Magnolia officinalis and Schisandra chinensis (Magnoliaceae), Corydalis yanhusuo (Papaveraceae), Citrus reticulata (Rutaceae), Bupleurum chinense and Ligusticum chuanxiong (Apiaceae) substantially active with MICs close to 60.0 microg/ml. As to antibacterial actions of the aqueous extracts of the same drugs, those derived from Cassia obtusifolia (Fabaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii and Eugenia caryophyllata were remarkably inhibitory against all the six Helicobacter pylori strains (MICs: approximately 60 microg/ml). The work compared almost quantitatively the magnitude of the anti-Helicobacter pylori actions of the 30 most prescribed gastritis-treating Chinese herbal drugs, and located as well some source plants where potent anti-Helicobacter pylori phytochemicals could be characterized.	bupleurum chinense gastritis
1	Abrin P2 suppresses proliferation and induces apoptosis of colon cancer cells via mitochondrial membrane depolarization and caspase activation.To explore the cytotoxic mechanism of abrin P2 on human colon cancer HCT-8 cells, abrin P2 was isolated from the seed of Abrus precatorius L. It was found that abrin P2 exhibited cytotoxicity toward 12 different human cancer cell lines. Our results demonstrated that abrin P2 suppressed the proliferation of human colon cancer cells (HCT-8 cells) and induced cell cycle arrest at the S and G2/M phases. The mechanism by which abrin P2 inhibited cell proliferation was via the down-regulation of cyclin B1, proliferating cell nuclear antigen and Ki67, as well as the up-regulation of P21. In addition, abrin P2 induced a dose- and time-dependent increase in the rate of HCT-8 cell apoptosis. Treatment with both Z-VAD-FMK, a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, and abrin P2 demonstrated that abrin P2 induced HCT-8 cell apoptosis via the activation of caspases. Together, our results revealed that abrin P2-induced apoptosis in HCT-8 cells was associated with the activation of caspases-3/-8/-9, the reduction in the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and the increase in cytochrome c release. We further showed that abrin P2 administration effectively suppressed the growth of colon cancer xenografts in nude mice. This is the first report that abrin P2 effectively inhibits colon cancer cell growth in vivo and in vitro by suppressing proliferation and inducing apoptosis. 	abrus precatorius abrin p2
2	Cinnamon and Chronic Diseases.Cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum and Cinnamon cassia), the eternal tree of tropical medicine, belongs to the Lauraceae family and is one of the most important spices used daily by people all over the world. It contains a lot of manganese, iron, dietary fiber, and calcium. Cinnamon contains derivatives, such as cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid, cinnamate, and numerous other components such as polyphenols and antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, anticancer effects. Several reports have dealt with the numerous properties of cinnamon in the forms of bark, essential oils, bark powder, and phenolic compounds, and each of these properties can play a key role in human health. Recently, many trials have explored the beneficial effects of cinnamon in Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, arthritis, and arteriosclerosis, but still we need further investigations to provide additional clinical evidence for this spice against cancer and inflammatory, cardioprotective, and neurological disorders.	cinnamon alzheimer's disease
1	Evaluation of the antioxidant effects of Ziziphus mauritiana Lam. Leaf extracts against chronic ethanol-induced hepatotoxicity in rat liver.Chronic alcohol ingestion is known to increase the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby leading to liver damage. Antioxidant enzymes act individually or in combination to reduce or counter the effect of these ROS. Chronic administration of alcohol at (40% v/v, 1 ml/100 g), for 6 weeks showed a significant (p&lt;0.05) elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bilirubin (TB). There was also a significant (p&lt;0.05) decreased levels of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and superoxide dismutase compared to control rats. Pre-treatment of rats with 200, 400 mg/kg body weight of aqueous leaf extract of Ziziphus mauritiana or 100 mg/kg silymarin resulted in a significant (p&lt;0.05) decreased levels of ALT, AST, ALP, and TB with levels of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and superoxide dismutase showing a significant (p&lt;0.05) increase compared to group administered alcohol only. Histopathology of rat liver administered with alcohol only resulted in severe necrosis, mononuclear cell aggregation and fatty degeneration in the central and mid zonal areas which was a characteristic of a damaged liver. Pre-treatment with the aqueous extract of Ziziphus mauritiana or silymarin reduced the morphological changes that are associated with chronic alcohol administration. The presence of tannins, saponins and phenolic compounds observed in the plant extract could be responsible for the observed effects of decreasing the levels of injured tissue marker and lipid peroxidation.	ziziphus mauritiana silymarin
1	In vitro cytotoxic activity of isolated acridones alkaloids from Zanthoxylum leprieurii Guill. et Perr.Chemical investigation of the roots and fruits of Zanthoxylumleprieurii Guill. et Perr. led to the isolation of three new alkaloids including two acridone derivatives, 3-hydroxy-1,4-dimethoxy-10-methyl-9-acridone (2) and 3-hydroxy-1,2-dimethoxy-10-methyl-9-acridone (3) named helebelicine A and B, respectively, and one secobenzo[c]phenantridine, 10-O-demethyl-12-O-methylarnottianamide (10), together with thirteen other compounds. The structures of compounds 2, 3 and 10 as well as those of the known compounds were elucidated by using spectroscopic methods and by comparison with reported data. The brine-shrimp (artemia salina) lethality bioassay of the chloroform extract of the fruits showed modest cytotoxicity with LD(50) at 13.1microg/mL. Isolated compounds 1, 4-6 were found to be moderately active against lung carcinoma cells (A549), colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (DLD-1) and normal cells (WS1) with IC(50) values ranging from 27 to 77microM. In contrast to the positive control etoposide used, the cytotoxicity of the most active compound 4 was found to be selective against cancer cells in comparison to normal cells WS1 with IC(50) of 51+/-8microM and 4.3+/-0.4microM, respectively.

0	Combined treatment with Cinnamaldehyde and beta-TCP had an additive effect on bone formation and angiogenesis in critical size calvarial defect in ovariectomized rats.Accumulating evidence suggests that improvements in osteogenesis and angiogenesis play an important role in repairing osteoporotic bone defects. Cinnamomum cassia (C. cassia), a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, is reported to show anabolic effects on osteoblasts. However, whether C. cassia could actually repair bone defects in osteoporotic conditions remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of combined treatment with Cinnamaldehyde (main oil isolated from the C. cassia) and beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP) on bone formation and angiogenesis in critical size calvarial defects in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Using a previously established OVX model, 5 mm critical size calvarial defect was established in OVX rats. All OVX rats were then randomly divided into OVX group (OVX rats + empty defect), TCP group (OVX rats + beta-TCP), and CTCP group (Cinnamaldehyde 75 mg/kg/day for 12 weeks + beta-TCP). Twelve weeks after treatment, according to Micro-CT and HE staining, combination of Cinnamaldehyde and beta-TCP had an additive effect on bone regeneration compared with other groups (p &lt; 0.05). Based on dynamic fluorochrome-labelling analysis, Cinnamaldehyde+beta-TCP continuously promoted new bone mineralization compared with other groups at each time point (p &lt; 0.05). Microfil perfusion suggested that CTCP group showed more neovascularization compared with other groups (p &lt; 0.05). Immunohistochemical assay supported the findings that Cinnamaldehyde+beta-TCP enhanced expression of OCN, VEGF and CD31. The present study demonstrated that combined treatment with Cinnamaldehyde and beta-TCP promoted bone formation and angiogenesis in osteoporotic bone defects, which provides a promising new strategy for repairing bone defects in osteoporotic conditions.

1	Total Flavones of Abelmoschus manihot Remodels Gut Microbiota and Inhibits Microinflammation in Chronic Renal Failure Progression by Targeting Autophagy-Mediated Macrophage Polarization.Background: Recently, progression of chronic renal failure (CRF) has been closely associated with gut microbiota dysbiosis and intestinal metabolite-derived microinflammation. In China, total flavones of Abelmoschus manihot (TFA), a component of Abelmoschus manihot, has been widely used to delay CRF progression in clinics for the past two decades. However, the overall therapeutic mechanisms remain obscure. In this study, we designed experiments to investigate the renoprotective effects of TFA in CRF progression and its underlying mechanisms involved in gut microbiota and microinflammation, compared with febuxostat (FEB), a potent non-purine selective inhibitor of xanthine oxidase. Methods: In vivo, the CRF rat models were induced by uninephrectomy, potassium oxonate, and proinflammatory diet, and received either TFA suspension, FEB, or vehicle after modeling for 28 days. In vitro, the RAW 264.7 cells were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with or without TFA or FEB. Changes in parameters related to renal injury, gut microbiota dysbiosis, gut-derived metabolites, and microinflammation were analyzed in vivo. Changes in macrophage polarization and autophagy and its related signaling were analyzed both in vivo and in vitro. Results: For the modified CRF model rats, the administration of TFA and FEB improved renal injury, including renal dysfunction and renal tubulointerstitial lesions; remodeled gut microbiota dysbiosis, including decreased Bacteroidales and Lactobacillales and increased Erysipelotrichales; regulated gut-derived metabolites, including d-amino acid oxidase, serine racemase, d-serine, and l-serine; inhibited microinflammation, including interleukin 1beta (IL1beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and nuclear factor-kappaB; and modulated macrophage polarization, including markers of M1/M2 macrophages. More importantly, TFA and FEB reversed the expression of beclin1 (BECN1) and phosphorylation of p62 protein and light chain 3 (LC3) conversion in the kidneys by activating the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase-sirtuin 1 (AMPK-SIRT1) signaling. Further, TFA and FEB have similar effects on macrophage polarization and autophagy and its related signaling in vitro. Conclusion: In this study, we demonstrated that TFA, similar to FEB, exerts its renoprotective effects partially by therapeutically remodeling gut microbiota dysbiosis and inhibiting intestinal metabolite-derived microinflammation. This is achieved by adjusting autophagy-mediated macrophage polarization through AMPK-SIRT1 signaling. These findings provide more accurate information on the role of TFA in delaying CRF progression.	abelmoschus manihot flavones
3	Nitidine chloride suppresses epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in osteosarcoma cell migration and invasion through Akt/GSK-3beta/Snail signaling pathway.Metastasis is the main cause of death in osteosarcoma. Targeting the process of metastasis is a main strategy for osteosarcoma therapy. As a traditional Chinese medicine, Zanthoxylum nitidum (Roxb) has been applied to treat various diseases, including cancer. However, no evidence has been shown on the anti-metastasis effect of nitidine chloride (NC) that was extracted from Zanthoxylum nitidum (Roxb) on osteosarcoma cells, or its underling mechanisms. In the present study, we aimed to demonstrate the role of NC on the migration and invasion of osteosarcoma cells. Viability and proliferation of osteosarcoma cells were examined by MTT assay. Then, by appling scratch wound healing assay and Transwell assays, we evaluated migratory and invasive ability of the cells, respectively. Moreover, the expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers were determined after treatment with NC. Furthermore, the expression of Akt, GSK-3beta and Snail were detected by western blot analysis. In addition, the GSK-3beta activity was examined by GSK-3beta kinase assay. Finally, an inhibitor of GSK-3beta, lithium chloride (LiCl) was applied to testify the effect of NC on the expression of EMT markers and Snail. We found that the proliferative, migratory and invasive ability of the U2OS osteosarcoma cells were all suppressed when treated with NC. NC increased the expression of E-cadherin and decreased the expression of N-cadherin, vimentin and fibronectin in a dose-dependent manner. NC also exerted its ability to suppress the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3beta so as to activate GSK-3beta. Then, by using an GSK-3beta inhibitor, LiCl, we revealed the effect of GSK-3beta in the expression of EMT markers. The expression of Snail was inhibited when treated with NC and LiCl also reversed the NC-inhibited Snail expression. Taken together, these results revealed that NC suppressed EMT and decreased the invasive ability of osteosarcoma cells via the Akt/GSK-3beta/snail signaling pathway. 	NC osteosarcoma

Based on combined spectral analyses, the structures of new compounds 4 and 5 were determined to be 2',3'-dihydroxy-alpha-sanshool and 2',3'-dihydroxy-beta-sanshool, respectively. These compounds exhibited weak cytotoxicity in the A-549 (human lung cancer) cell line.	zanthoxylum piperitum 2',3'-dihydroxy-alpha-sanshool
1	Optimization of ultrasonic extraction of polysaccharides from Ziziphus jujuba Mill. by response surface methodology.BACKGROUND: Ziziphus jujuba Mill. is nutritious and used as food and medicine for more than two thousand years. It has many pharmacological effects, such as elimination of fatigue, dilation of blood vessels, etc. The polysaccharide in it is one of the bioactive substances. In this paper, the ultrasonic extraction effects on the yield and activity of polysaccharide were studied. RESULTS: The optimum ultrasonic extraction conditions were investigated based on a Box-Behnken statistical experimental design. Response surface methodology (RSM) of three factors (ultrasonic power, extraction time and extraction temperature) and three levels was employed to optimize the yield and the antioxidant activity of the polysaccharides. The experimental data were fitted to quadratic response surface models using multiple regression analysis. The best extraction conditions were 120 W, 15 min. and 55 C for highest yield, and 80 W, 15 min. and 40 C for highest hydroxyl radical scavenging activity. CONCLUSION: The study showed that high ultrasonic power was good for obtaining high yield but bad for keeping the antioxidant activity of the polysaccharides.	ziziphus jujuba mill polysaccharides
2	Anti-allergic activity of some selected plants in the Zingiberaceae family.Ethanolic and water extracts, together with volatile oils from the rhizomes of six selected Zingiberaceous plants, including Curcuma mangga, Kaempferia galanga, Kaempferia parviflora, Zingiber cassumunar, Zingiber officinale and Zingiber zerumbet were investigated for their anti-allergic activities using a RBL-2H3 cell line. The ethanolic (EtOH) extract of Kaempferia parviflora exhibited the most potent anti-allergic effect against antigen-induced beta-hexosaminidase release as a marker of degranulation in RBL-2H3 cells, with an IC(50) value of 10.9 microg/ml, followed by Zingiber cassumunar (EtOH, IC(50)=12.9 microg/ml) and Curcuma mangga (water, IC(50)=36.1 microg/ml). The volatile oils of these six plants were apparently inactive (IC(50)&gt;100 microg/ml). The crude extracts were also tested on beta-hexosaminidase activity to clarify whether their effects were due to the inhibition of enzyme activity or of degranulation. As a result, the plant extracts were inactive against the enzyme activity of beta-hexosaminidase. These findings support the use in Thai traditional medicine of these selected Zingiberaceous plants, especially Kaempferia parviflora and Zingiber cassumunar, for treatment of allergy and allergic-related diseases.	zingiber cassumunar allergy
3	Cytotoxic activity of extracts and crude saponins from Zanthoxylum armatum DC. against human breast (MCF-7, MDA-MB-468) and colorectal (Caco-2) cancer cell lines.BACKGROUND: Zanthoxylum armatum DC has been an important traditional plant known for its medicinal properties. It is well known for its antimicrobial, larvicidal and cytotoxic activities. METHODS: The potential anticancer effects of the methanol extract and the crude saponins from fruit, bark and leaves of Z. armatum on breast (MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7) and colorectal (Caco-2) cancer cell lines using MTT, neutral red uptake(NRU) and DAPI stain assays were evaluated. RESULTS: In MTT assay the methanol extract of fruit (Zf), bark (Zb) and leaves (Zl) of Zanthoxylum armatum, showed significant and dose dependent growth inhibition of MCF-7, MDA MB-468 and Caco-2 cancer cell lines in a dose of 200 mug/ml and above. The saponins (Zf.Sa, Zb.Sa and Zl.Sa) showed significant activity against MDA MB-468 (95, 94.5 and 85.3%) as compared to MCF-7 (79.8, 9.43, 49.08%) and Caco-2 (75.8, 61.8, 68.62%) respectively. The extracts were further tested in more sensitive NRU assay and its was found that Zf extract showed higher cytotoxic activity as compared to Zb and Zl extracts with 100 mug/ml concentration. The breast cancer cell lines showed more sensitivity toward the crude saponins from fruit and bark with maximum inhibition of up to 93.81(+-2.32) % with respect to 71.19(+- 2.76) of Actinomycin-D. DAPI staining experiment showed that saponins from fruit induced apoptosis mode of cell death in all three types of cell lines while saponins form leaves and bark showed similar results against MDA MB-468 indicated by nuclear fragmentation and chromatin condensation. The effect of saponins from fruit, bark and leaves (Zf.Sa, Zb.Sa and Zl.Sa) against Caco-2 cell lines inhibited the growth of Caco-2 by 53.16 (+-3.31) %, 66.43 (+- 3.24) and 45.96 (+- 10.67) respectively with respect to Actinomycin-D (4 muM) which showed the growth inhibition of 65.40(+-4.29) %. CONCLUSION: The current study clearly demonstrates that the extract and crude saponins from fruit, bark and leaves of traditional medicinal plant Zanthoxyllum armatum DC., has the potential to exert its cytotoxic effect on cancer cell lines isolated form human by a mechanism involving apoptosis. The overall finding demonstrate that this plant specially fruits, could be potential source of new anticancer compounds for possible drug development against cancer.	saponins cancer
1	Dihydrobenzo[c]phenanthridine alkaloids from stem bark of Zanthoxylum nitidum.Five novel alkaloids, zanthomuurolanine ( 1), epi-zanthomuurolanine ( 2), zanthocadinanines A ( 3) and B ( 4), and epi-zanthocadinanine B ( 5), composed of dihydrochelerythrine and a cadinane-type sesquiterpene linked by a methylene bridge, have been isolated from stem bark of Zanthoxylum nitidum. These structures were elucidated by spectroscopic techniques (UV, IR, MS, CD, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, DEPT, COSY, NOESY, HSQC, and HMBC analyses). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies confirmed the relative configurations of 1 and 4 and provided additional support for the structures of 2, 3, and 5.	zanthoxylum nitidum cadinane
2	The effect of medicinal plants of Islamabad and Murree region of Pakistan on insulin secretion from INS-1 cells.In vitro testing of the extracts of medicinal plants collected from Islamabad and the Murree region on insulin secretagogue activity was carried out. Dried ethanol extracts of all plants (ZH1-ZH19) were dissolved in ethanol and DMSO, and tested at various concentrations (between 1 and 40 microg/mL) for insulin release from INS-1 cells in the presence of 5.5 mM glucose. Glibenclamide was used as a control. Promising insulin secretagogue activity in various plant extracts at 1, 10, 20 and 40 microg/mL was found, while in some cases a decrease in insulin secretion was also observed. Artemisia roxburghiana, Salvia coccinia and Monstera deliciosa showed insulin secretagogue activity at 1 microg/mL (p &lt; 0.05) while Abies pindrow, Centaurea iberica and Euphorbia helioscopia were active at 10 microg/mL (p &lt; 0.05). Extracts of Bauhinia variegata and Bergenia himalacia showed effects at 20 microg/mL (p &lt; 0.05), and Taraxacum officinale and Viburnum foetens at 40 microg/mL (p &lt; 0.05). Insulin secretagogue activity could not be detected in the extracts of Adhatoda vasica, Cassia fistula, Chrysanthemum leucanthemum, Morus alba, Plectranthus rugosus, Peganum harmala and Olea ferruginea. The results suggest that medicinal plants of Islamabad and the Murree region of Pakistan may be potential natural resources for antidiabetic compounds.	viburnum foetens insulin secretion

Biological activity of the mixtures of polar lipids and natural antioxidants echinochrome A from flat sea urchin Scaphechinus mirabilis and polyphenolic complex from sea grass Zostera marina was studied in rats with experimental model of atherosclerosis and diabetes. These experiments revealed optimal compositions for mixtures of polar lipids and antioxidants, which possess high medical-corrective activity. Proposed mechanisms of action of the polar lipids (containing different polyunsaturated fatty acids) and antioxidants studied are presented. These compositions may be used for creation of new biologically-active additives and drugs.	zostera marina diabetes
2	An herbal formula attenuates collagen-induced arthritis via inhibition of JAK2-STAT3 signaling and regulation of Th17 cells in mice.Wenjinghuoluo prescription, a traditional Chinese medicine compound treatment of rheumatoid arthritis characterized by wind-cold-dampness arthralgia, contains five herbs, namely, C. cassia Presl., Cinnamomum cassia Presl., Paeonia lactiflora Pall., Saposhnikovia divaricate (Turcz.) Schischk., and Clematis chinensis Osbeck. We have reported that WJHL could inhibit the production of inflammatory mediators in immune cells. This study explored the effect and mechanism of WJHL on collagen-induced arthritis mice. WJHL could significantly improve clinical arthritic conditions; inhibit bone erosion and osteophyte formation in joints; decrease expression of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-17); reduce protein expression levels of JAK2, p-JAK2, STAT3, p-STAT3 and gene expression levels of JAK2, STAT3, IL-17A, RORgammat mRNA; elevate osteoprotegerin and Foxp3 mRNA levels and lower Th17 cell proportions in splenocytes. Results suggest that WJHL, specifically regulating the JAK2/STAT3 pathway and Th17 cells, may be a promising herbal medicine candidate for the treatment of RA.	cinnamomum cassia RA
1	In vitro activities of plant extracts on human Loa loa isolates and cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells.Loa loa, a filarial worm, can cause fatal encephalitis in humans. In an attempt to find alternatives to the standard treatments (ivermectin and diethylcarbamazine citrate), we tested 12 methanolic extracts of nine traditional plant remedies. The extracts (100-0.09 microg/ml) were incubated with 20 Loa loa microfilariae isolated from patients at 37 degrees C with 5% CO(2) in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal serum and antibiotics. Activity was evaluated 120 h later by counting live microfilariae under a microscope. Cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells was estimated by measuring 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2-5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide transformation to formazan at 450 nM in a spectrophotometer. The plants tested were Lophira alata, Greenwayodendron suaveolens, Uapaca togoensis, Zanthoxylum heitzii, Peperomia pellucida, Piptadeniastrum africanum, Petersianthus macrocarpus, Vernonia conferta, and Vernonia hymenolepis. Chemical screening showed that most of the extracts contained reducing sugars, tannin or polyphenols, sterols or triterpenes, saponosides, and alkaloids. None contained carotinoids and few contained flavonoids. The 50% lethal concentration ranged from 0.22 to 70.28 microg/ml, while the 50% inhibitory concentration for eukaryotic cells (IC(50)) ranged from 8.52 to 119.52 microg/ml. Extracts of P. macrocarpus (selectivity index = 72.16), P. africanum (13.69), Z. heitzii (12.11), and L. alata (9.26) were highly selective for L. loa.	p. africanum sugars
3	Protective effect of the essential oil of Zanthoxylum myriacanthum var. pubescens against dextran sulfate sodium-induced intestinal inflammation in mice.BACKGROUND: Zanthoxylum myriacanthum var. pubescens is an ethnic medicine for digestive disease known as Maqian. A previous report showed that the Maqian fruits essential oil (MQEO) exhibited an NO inhibitory effect on RAW 264.7 cells, but the effect on inflammatory disease in vivo remains unknown. PURPOSE: To investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of Z. myriacanthum var. pubescens as potential candidate for the treatment of intestinal inflammation. STUDY DESIGN: Evaluation of anti-inflammatory effect of MQEO using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced intestinal inflammation in mice and exploration of the mechanisms with THP-1 cells. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were provided drinking water containing 3% DSS for 10 days followed by normal drinking water for 3 days. MQEO (35 and 70mg/kg) were given 5 days before experiments and continued for another 13 days. At the end of experiments, mice were euthanized and colonic tissue was collected to be analyzed by H&amp;E staining, RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry for evaluating the damage of colons, the mRNA levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-12p35 and TNF-alpha, and the expressions of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). The LPS-stimulated THP-1 cell line was used for exploring the role of inflammatory markers using ELISA, western blot and flow cytometry methods. RESULTS: Oral administration of MQEO (35 and 70mg/kg) markedly attenuated the symptoms of intestinal inflammation, including diarrhea, rectal bleeding, and loss of body weight. It also reduced the shortening of colon length and histopathological damage. The expressions of MPO and MMP-9 and the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6 and IL-12p35) in colonic tissue significantly decreased after MQEQ treatment. The activation of NF-kappaB p65 in colonic mucosa was also markedly suppressed. In addition, MQEO significantly suppressed LPS-stimulated production of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, effectively blocked phosphorylation of IKK and IkappaB, and dose-dependently reduced LPS-stimulated expression of TLR4 in THP-1 cells at concentrations ranging from 0.01% to 0.05% (v/v). CONCLUSION: MQEO exhibited protective effect against DSS-induced intestinal inflammation and the anti-inflammatory activity may be associated with TLR4 mediated NF-kappaB signaling pathway, suggesting it might be used as an anti-inflammatory agent.	essential oil intestinal inflammation
2	Nephroprotective properties of the methanol stem extract of Abrus precatorius on gentamicin-induced renal damage in rats.Background The use of plants for the treatment and prevention of diseases in man and his animals has led to a renewed scientific interest in the use of medicinal plants for therapeutic purposes. The nephroprotective properties of methanol stem bark extract of Abrus precatorius against gentamicin-induced renal damage in rats was evaluated in this study. Methods Thirty male Wistar rats were divided into five equal groups. Group A was the negative control group while B was the positive control group which received gentamicin 100 mg/kg intra-peritoneally for 6 days. Group C were pretreated with 100 mg/kg extract for the 3 days and then concurrently with gentamicin 100 mg/kg for 3 days and group D were pretreated with 200 mg/kg extract for 3 days and then concurrently with gentamicin 100 mg/kg for 3 days. Group E received gentamicin intraperitoneally for 6 days followed by administration of 200 mg/kg of the extract for 3 days. Blood samples, kidneys and kidney homogenates were collected for haematological, biochemical, histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis. Results The results showed that no significant haematological changes were noted. The groups treated with extract exhibited significant increase in body weight gain. While group B significantly exhibited focal areas of inflammation, fatty degeneration, congestion of vessels, tubular necrosis and glomerular atrophy, the lesions were mild with the treated groups. Treated groups exhibited a dose dependent significant decrease in serum creatinine, urea, XO, NO and Myeloperoxidase, AOPP, Protein carbonyl, H2O2 generated and MDA levels when compared with group B. There were significant dose dependent improvements in SOD, GST, GSH, Protein thiol, and non-protein thiol levels in the treated groups when compared with group B. In immunohistochemistry, Group B exhibited over expression of CRP and NF-kappaB levels, and marked reduction in expression of Bcl-2 while the reverse was seen in the groups treated with methanol extracts of Abrus precatorius. Conclusion The methanol extract of Abrus precatorius plays a vital role against gentamicin induced renal damage by reducing levels of renal markers of oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis, enhancing enzymatic and non enzymatic renal antioxidant system, alongside an increase in Bcl-2 and a decrease in NF-kappaB and CRP expressions.	abrus precatorius renal damage
1	Unified approach to catechin hetero-oligomers: first total synthesis of trimer EZ-EG-CA isolated from Ziziphus jujuba.A catechin hetero-trimer isolated from Ziziphus jujuba has been synthesized. Among three constituent monomers, (-)-epiafzelechin and (-)-epigallocatechin were prepared by de novo synthesis. Trimer formation relied on the unified approach to oligomers based on the bromo-capping and the orthogonal activation, reaching the reported structure of the natural product.	ziziphus jujuba catechin
1	Xenobiotic biotransformation of 4-methoxy-N-methyl-2-quinolone, isolated from Zanthoxylum monophyllum.Phytochemical evaluation of Zanthoxylum monophyllum has led to the isolation of the alkaloid 4-methoxy-N-methyl-2-quinolone (1) with a significant activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), with an IC50 value of 1.5 microg/mL. Xenobiotic biotransformation of 1 has been conducted with the general goal of increasing the bioactivity of the compound and contributing new leads for further pharmacological research. Twenty-nine microorganisms were used for screening and two (Aspergillus flavus and Cunninghamella echinulata var. echinulata) were able to transform compound 1 to 4-methoxy-2-quinolone (2). Structural identification of the compounds was based on NMR, IR, and MS data.	zanthoxylum monophyllum 4-methoxy-N-methyl-2-quinolone
1	Synergistic antioxidant activity of green tea with some herbs.Cardiovascular diseases, cancer, arthritis, etc. are caused by free radicals that are byproducts of metabolic pathways. Selected plants namely Vitis vinifera, Phyllanthus emblica L., Punica granatum, Cinnamomum cassia, Ginkgo biloba L., and Camellia sinensis Linn. are reported to produce antioxidant property. This study is undertaken to support the hypothesis that formulation of a polyherbal combination of these plants shows a synergistic effect with green tea. The extracts of each drug were characterized by phytochemical studies and tests for phenolics and flavonoids. In vitro antioxidant activity for individual drug and its combination was determined by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), superoxide, and nitric oxide free radical scavenging methods. Our results suggest that a combination of all these herbs with green tea can synergistically enhance antioxidant activity and thus lower doses of each herb with green tea may be used. Antioxidant potential of polyherbal combination was also comparable to that of standard ascorbic acid. Studies showed that selected individual plants contained abundant quantity of phenolics and flavonoids and their polyherbal combination with green tea was found to produce best antioxidant activity among all individual extracts. This will help in avoiding undesirable side effects due to higher doses of single herb.	cinnamomum cassia flavonoids
1	Seed oil and fatty acid content in okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) and related species.Approximately 1100 genebank accessions of okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) and 540 additional accessions that included six of its related species-A. caillei, A. crinitis, A. esculentus, A. ficulneus, A. manihot, A. moschatus and A. tuberculatus-were evaluated for seed oil content using time domain NMR (TD-NMR). Oil content in seed of A. caillei, A. esculentus, A. ficulneus, A. manihot, A. moschatus and A. tuberculatus was in the ranges 2.51-13.61%, 12.36-21.56%, 6.62-16.7%, 16.1-22.0%, 10.3-19.8% and 10.8-23.2%, respectively. Accession PI639680 (A. tuberculatus) had the highest seed oil content (~23%). Accessions of A. esculentus with high seed oil content included PI nos. PI274350 (21.5%), PI538082 (20.9%) and PI538097 (20.9%). Values for the three accessions of A. manihot with the highest seed oil content were PI nos. PI639673 (20.4%), PI639674 (20.9%) and PI639675 (21.9%), all representing var. tetraphyllus. Average percent seed oil in materials of A. esculentus from Turkey and Sudan (17.35% and 17.36%, respectively) exceeded the averages of materials from other locations. Ninety-eight accessions (total of six species) were also examined for fatty acid composition. Values of linoleic acid ranged from 23.6-50.65% in A. esculentus. However, mean linoleic acid concentrations were highest in A. tuberculatus and A. ficulneus. Concentrations of palmitic acid were significantly higher in A. esculentus (range of 10.3-36.35%) when compared to that of other species, and reached a maximum in PI489800 Concentrations of palmitic acid were also high in A. caillei (mean = ~30%). Levels of oleic acid were highest in A. manihot, A. manihot var. tetraphyllus and A. moschatus.	a. manihot oleic acid
2	Zanthoxylum schinifolium leaf ethanol extract inhibits adipocyte differentiation through inactivation of the extracellular signal regulated kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathways in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes.Zanthoxylum schinifolium is widely used as a food flavoring in east Asia. Although this plant has also been used in traditional oriental medicine for the treatment of the common cold, toothache, stomach ache, diarrhea and jaundice, its anti-obesity activity remains to be elucidated. The present study investigated the effects of ethanol extract from the leaves of Z. schinifolium (EEZS) on adipocyte differentiation, and its underlying mechanism, in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes. The results demonstrated that EEZS effectively suppressed intracellular lipid accumulation at non-toxic concentrations, and was associated with the downregulation of several adipocyte-specific transcription factors, including peroxisome proliferation-activity receptor gamma (PPARgamma), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP)alpha and C/EBPbeta, in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, it was observed that EEZS markedly inactivated the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways, which act upstream of PPARgamma and C/EBPs in adipogenesis. These results suggested that EEZS inhibited lipid accumulation by downregulating the major transcription factors involved in the pathway of adipogenesis, including PPARgamma, C/EBPalpha and C/EBPbeta, via regulation of the ERK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways in 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. This indicated the potential use of EEZS as an anti-obesity agent.	z. schinifolium diarrhea
2	Insecticidal activities of bark, leaf and seed extracts of Zanthoxylum heitzii against the African malaria vector Anopheles gambiae.The olon tree, Zanthoxylum heitzii (syn. Fagara heitzii) is commonly found in the central-west African forests. In the Republic of Congo (Congo-Brazzaville) its bark is anecdotally reported to provide human protection against fleas. Here we assess the insecticidal activities of Z. heitzii stem bark, seed and leaf extracts against Anopheles gambiae s.s, the main malaria vector in Africa. Extracts were obtained by Accelerated Solvent Extraction (ASE) using solvents of different polarity and by classical Soxhlet extraction using hexane as solvent. The insecticidal effects of the crude extracts were evaluated using topical applications of insecticides on mosquitoes of a susceptible reference strain (Kisumu [Kis]), a strain homozygous for the L1014F kdr mutation (kdrKis), and a strain homozygous for the G119S Ace1R allele (AcerKis). The insecticidal activities were measured using LD50 and LD95 and active extracts were characterized by NMR spectroscopy and HPLC chromatography. Results show that the ASE hexane stem bark extract was the most effective compound against An. gambiae (LD50 = 102 ng/mg female), but was not as effective as common synthetic insecticides. Overall, there was no significant difference between the responses of the three mosquito strains to Z. heitzii extracts, indicating no cross resistance with conventional pesticides. 	fagara heitzii malaria
1	Purification and characterization of three toxins and two agglutinins from Abrus precatorius seed by using lactamyl-Sepharose affinity chromatography.Three toxins, abrin-I, -II, and -III, and two agglutinins, APA-I and -II, were purified from the seeds of Abrus precatorius by lactamyl-Sepharose affinity chromatography followed by gel filtration and DEAE-Sephacel column chromatography. Abrin-I did not bind on DEAE-Sephacel column chromatography and the bound abrin-II, abrin-III, APA-I, and APA-II were eluted with a sodium acetate gradient. The identity of each protein was established by sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing. The relative molecular weights are abrin-I, 64,000; abrin-II and abrin-III, 63,000 each: APA-I, 130,000; and APA-II, 128,000. Isoelectric focusing revealed microheterogeneity due to the presence of isoforms in each protein. Toxicity and binding studies further confirmed the differences among the lectins. The time course of inhibition of protein synthesis in thymocytes by the toxins showed lag times of 78, 61, and 72 min with Ki's of 0.55, 0.99, and 0.74 ms-1 at a 0.63 nM concentration of each of abrin-I, -II, and -III, respectively. A Scatchard plot obtained from the equilibrium measurement for the lectins binding to lactamyl-Sepharose beads showed nonlinearity, indicating a cooperative mode of binding which was not observed for APA-I binding to Sepharose 4B beads. Further, by the criterion of the isoelectric focusing profile, it was shown that the least toxic abrin-I and the highly toxic abrin-II isolated by lactamyl-Sepharose chromatography were not retained on a low-affinity Sepharose 4B matrix, which signifies the necessity of using a high-affinity matrix for the purification of the lectins.	abrus precatorius Abrin-I
1	Metabolic profiles of the Flos Abelmoschus manihot extract by intestinal bacteria from the normal and CKD model rats based on UPLC-Q-TOF/MS.Flos Abelmoschus manihot is a traditional herbal medicine widely used in clinical practice to tackle chronic kidney disease (CKD) for thousands of years. Nowadays, many studies indicate that gut bacteria are closely related to the progression of CKD and CKD-related complications. In this study, a UPLC-Q-TOF/MS method coupled with the MetaboLynx  software was established and successfully applied to investigate the metabolites and metabolic profile of Flos A. manihot extract by intestinal bacteria from normal and CKD rats. Eight parent components and eight metabolites were characterized by their protonated ions. Among these compounds, 15 were detected in the two group samples while M16 was only determined in the CKD model samples. Compared with the quercetin-type glycosides, fewer myricetin-type and gossypetin-type metabolites were obtained in the two group samples. These metabolites suggested that deglycosylation and methylation are the major metabolic pathways of Flos A. manihot extract. Few differences of metabolite classes were observed in the two group samples. However, the concentrations of aglycones such as quercetin, myricetin and gossypetin in the normal samples were notably higher than those in the CKD model samples. The results are important in unravelling the pharmacological effects of A. manihot and clarifying its mechanism of action in vivo.	a. manihot myricetin
3	New indolopyridoquinazoline, benzo[c]phenanthridines and cytotoxic constituents from Zanthoxylum integrifoliolum.Three new alkaloids, 7,8-dehydro-1-methoxyrutaecarpine, isodecarine, and 8-demethyloxychelerythrine, together with sixteen known compounds, norchelerythrine, oxychelerythrine, decarine, dihydrocherythrinylacetaldehyde, 6-acetonyldihydrochelerythrine, rutaecarpine, 1-hydroxyrutaecarpine, gamma-fagarine, skimmianine, (-)-matairesinol, (-)-isoarctigenin, (+)-epipinoresinol, d-sesamin, lupeol, canthin-6-one, and arnottianamide have been isolated from the root bark of Zanthoxylum integrifoliolum. The structures of these new compounds were determined through spectral analyses. Among the isolates, 7,8-dehydro-1-methoxyrutaecarpine, norchelerythrine, oxychelerythrine, dihydrocherythrinylacetaldehyde, 6-acetonyldihydrochelerythrine, 1-hydroxyrutaecarpine, gamma-fagarine, skimmianine, (-)-matairesinol, and canthin-6-one exhibited cytotoxicities (ED50 values &lt; 4 microg/mL) against P-388 or HT-29 cell lines in vitro.	benzo[c]phenanthridines cytotoxicities
1	Phytochemical and biological activities of four wild medicinal plants.The fruits of four wild plants, namely, Capparis decidua, Ficus carica, Syzygium cumini, and Ziziphus jujuba, are separately used as traditional dietary and remedial agents in remote areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. The results of our study on these four plants revealed that the examined fruits were a valuable source of nutraceuticals and exhibited good level of antimicrobial activity. The fruits of these four investigated plants are promising source of polyphenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, and saponins. These four plants' fruits are good sources of iron, zinc, copper, manganese, selenium, and chromium. It was also observed that these fruits are potential source of antioxidant agent and the possible reason could be that these samples had good amount of phytochemicals. Hence, the proper propagation, conservation, and chemical investigation are recommended so that these fruits should be incorporated for the eradication of food and health related problems. 	ziziphus jujuba alkaloids
1	Variability of phenolic and alkaloid content in different plant parts of Carissa edulis Vahl and Zanthoxylum chalybeum Engl.OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to investigate the relative abundance and effect of post-harvest treatment on total phenolics (TP) and total alkaloids in the leaves and bark of Carissa edulis and Zanthoxylum chalybeum, which would give an indication of the suitability of leaves as alternative sources of medicine in these plant species. RESULTS: Results indicated higher levels of total phenolics than total alkaloids in both of the species under both freezing and air drying conditions. While more alkaloids were found in leaves compared to bark, there was no difference in abundance of phenols between the plant parts of both species. Air drying preserved more TPs than freezing and the opposite was true for alkaloids. For sustainability, leaves are recommended as an alternative source of medicine instead of the preferred root or stem bark. However, the choice of whether to dry or freeze will depend on the specific compound of interest. Assessment of spatial variability of medicinal properties is highly recommended.	carissa edulis phenols
2	Herbal medicines used in the treatment of malaria in Budiope county, Uganda.AIM OF THE STUDY: This study was conducted to document herbal medicines (HMs) used in the treatment of malaria as well as the existing knowledge, attitudes and practices related to malaria recognition, control and treatment in Budiope county, Uganda. METHODS: Data was collected using semi-structured interviews, and open- and close-ended questionnaires. RESULTS: The respondents had a good understanding of malaria, and could recognize it and distinguish it from other fever types. They were also aware that malaria was spread by mosquitoes. Malaria prevalence was high, and affected individuals an average of six times a year. Respondents avoided mosquito bites by using mosquito nets, clearing bush around their homesteads, and burning plant parts to generate smoke. They preferred treating malaria using allopathic medicines because, according to them, they lacked the appropriate traditional knowledge necessary to exploit plants for the treatment of malaria. Secondly, allopathic medicines were believed to be superior to HMs in the treatment of malaria. Twenty-seven species were used for the treatment of malaria. The most frequently mentioned were Vernonia amygdalina, Momordica foetida, Zanthoxylum chalybeum, Lantana camara and Mangifera indica. Drugs from these plants were prepared from single species as water extracts and were administered in variable doses over varied time periods.	momordica foetida malaria
0	Inhibition of P-glycoprotein-mediated transport by extracts of and monoterpenoids contained in Zanthoxyli fructus.Citrus (rutaceous) herbs are often used in traditional medicine and Japanese cuisine and can be taken concomitantly with conventional medicine. In this study, the effect of various citrus-herb extracts on P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated transport was examined in vitro to investigate a possible interaction with P-gp substrates. Component monoterpenoids of the essential oil in Zanthoxyli fructus was screened to find novel P-gp inhibitors. LLC-GA5-COL150 cells transfected with human MDR1 cDNA encoding P-gp were used. Cellular accumulation of [3H]digoxin was measured in the presence or absence of P-gp inhibitors or test samples. Aurantii fructus, Evodiae fructus, Aurantii fructus immaturus, Aurantii nobilis pericarpium, Phellodendri cortex, and Zanthoxyli fructus were extracted with hot water (decocted) and then fractionated with ethyl acetate. The cell to medium ratio of [3H]digoxin accumulation increased significantly in the presence of the decoction of Evodiae fructus, Aurantii nobilis pericarpium, and Zanthoxyli fructus, and the ethyl acetate fraction of all citrus herbs used. The ethyl acetate fraction of Zanthoxyli fructus exhibited the strongest inhibition of P-gp among tested samples with an IC50 value of 166 microg/mL. Then its component monoterpenoids, geraniol, geranyl acetate, (R)-(+)-limonene, (R)-(+)-linalool, citronellal, (R)-(+)-citronellal, DL-citronellol, (S)-(-)-beta-citronellol, and cineole, were screened. (R)-(+)-citronellal and (S)-(-)-beta-citronellol inhibited P-gp with IC50 values of 167 microM and 504 microM, respectively. These findings suggest that Zanthoxyli fructus may interact with P-gp substrates and that some monoterpenoids with the relatively lower molecular weight of about 150 such as (R)-(+)-citronellal can be potent inhibitors of P-gp.

2	The extract of Ziziphus jujuba fruit (jujube) induces expression of erythropoietin via hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha in cultured Hep3B cells.The fruit of Ziziphus jujuba Mill., known as jujube or Chinese date, is commonly consumed as health supplement or herbal medicine worldwide. To study the beneficial role of jujube in enhancing hematopoietic function, we investigated its roles on the expression of erythropoietin in cultured Hep3B human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Application of chemically standardized jujube water extract stimulated erythropoietin expression in a dose-dependent manner, with the highest response by ~ 100 % of increase. A plasmid containing hypoxia response element, a critical regulator for erythropoietin transcription, was transfected into Hep3B cells. Application of jujube water extract onto the transfected cells induced the transcriptional activity of the hypoxia response element. To account for its transcriptional activation, the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha was increased after treatment with jujube water extract: the increase was in both mRNA and protein levels. These results confirmed the hematopoietic function of jujube in the regulation of erythropoietin expression in liver cells. 	jujube hypoxia
4	Stimulatory effect of Cinnamomum cassia and cinnamic acid on angiogenesis through up-regulation of VEGF and Flk-1/KDR expression.Complementary and alternative medicine, Cinnamomum cassia is one of the medicinal plants that have been used to improve various diseases caused by insufficient blood circulation. However, relatively little work has been carried out on the angiogenic responses of C. cassia and its active compound cinnamic acid (CA), despite its excellent pharmacological action. In this study, we study the effect of the ethanol extract of C. cassia (CCE) and its active compound CA, on angiogenic processes in in vitro and in vivo. In the Matrigel plug assay in vivo, CCE and CA dose dependently increased von Willebrand Factor (vWF) antigen expression, and hemoglobin contents, whose elevation paralleled the onset of angiogenesis and was considered an early indicator of endothelial activation. CCE and CA induced endothelial cells proliferation, migration and tubule-like structure in vitro. The 25-50% increase observed with CCE (at low doses of 1 or 10 ng/ml) in HUVEC and BAEC proliferation was similar to that observed with CA. The migration and tubule-like structure effect were observed with HUVEC and BAEC. However, the effect of CCE, CA and VEGF on cell proliferation, migration and tubule-like structure in HUVEC were bigger than the effect of CCE, CA and VEGF in BAEC. In addition, CCE and CA each induced 2.2-fold and 2.5-fold increases the production of VEGF, the mRNA expression of VEGF and Flk-1/KDR, the receptor involved in proliferation, migration, and tubule-like structure of endothelial cells. These data suggest that CCE and its active compound CA induce angiogenesis in vivo and in vitro, and this pathway is related with VEGF and Flk-1/KDR expression of endothelial cells.

2	The inhibitory effect of plant extracts on the collagenolytic activity and cytotoxicity of human gingival fibroblasts by Porphyromonas gingivalis crude enzyme.It is well known that plant extracts inhibit some enzymatic activities. The present study examined the inhibitory effects of natural plant extracts against the collagenolytic activity of Porphyromonas gingivalis. The enzyme was isolated from a culture supernatant of P. gingivalis 381. The aqueous and 50% ethanolic extracts of Ginkgo biloba, Mosla chinensis, Salvia officinalis, Cinnamomum cassia, and a catechin extract of Camellia sinensis exhibited strong inhibitory effects on collagenolytic activity. The activities of these plant extracts were higher than that of tetracycline-HCl. They also inhibited the cytotoxicity of P. gingivalis crude enzyme against human gingival fibroblasts. C. sinensis catechin was the most effective agent in neutralizing the cytotoxicity of P. gingivalis. The aqueous and 50% ethanolic extracts of C. cassia had relatively strong anti-cytotoxic activity. Although the other samples strongly inhibited the collagenolytic activity of P. gingivalis, they were not effectively anti-cytotoxic. The present findings suggest that C. sinensis and C. cassia extracts are effective in reducing the pathogenicity of periodontopathic bacteria.	c. sinensis periodontopathic bacteria

1	Pharmacognostic and phytochemical studies of Zanthoxylum armatum DC.The pharmacognostic and phytochemical investigations on the leaf, stem bark, and fruit of Zanthoxylum armatum were carried out. Macroscopic study of leaf, stem bark, and fruit of Z. armatum revealed some of the characteristic features like size, shape, color, odor and taste of the crude drug. Distinguishing fragments were identified from the powder drug. Leaf, bark, and fruit powder of this plant have higher values of total, acid insoluble, and water soluble ash as compared to the powder of this plant exhausted with ethanol and n- hexane. Extraction values in methanol were highest for leaves (20.10%) and fruit (11%), while bark showed highest value in chloroform (8.5%). The extractive values varied among other parts with different solvents. Fluorescence analysis of the Z. Armatum leaf, stem bark, and fruit powder with various reagents showed characteristic coloration at day and under UV light. Quantitative phytochemical screening revealed the presence of many bioactive constituents in leaves, such as alkaloids (15.60+-0.10 mg/g), sterols (71.60+-0.10mg/g), saponins (21.57+-0.12mg/g), tannins (34.43+-0.21mg/g), phenols (11.66+-0.33mg/g) and flavonoids (13.68+-0.66mg/g). Alkaloids (19.60+-0.10mg/g), sterols (33.83+-0.29mg/g), saponins (14.78+-0.10mg/g), tannins (28.62+-0.13mg/g), phenols (16.48+-1.33mg/g) and flavonoids (18.33+-1.22mg/g) were reported form the bark, while fruits were reported to have alkaloids (25.07+-0.21mg/g), sterols (164.92+-0.14mg/g), saponins (28.60+-0.10mg/g), tannins (35.5+-0.5mg/g), phenols (21.68+-0.44mg/g) and flavonoids (22.8+-1.33mg/g). Z. armatum is an important medicinal plant, traditionally used for various ailments. This study will be helpful in the future pharmacognostic standardization of this important plant.	z. armatum sterols
1	Ultrasound-Assisted Extraction of Taxifolin, Diosmin, and Quercetin from Abies nephrolepis (Trautv.) Maxim: Kinetic and Thermodynamic Characteristics.Extraction behaviors of the 3 flavonoids taxifolin, diosmin, and quercetin have been investigated in Abies nephrolepis leaves and bark. The following operation parameters-ethanol volume fraction, liquid-solid ratio, temperature, ultrasound irradiation power and time, and ultrasound frequency-were varied to study their effect on the yield of the 3 flavonoids during extraction. The results showed that a low extraction efficiency occurred at 293.15 K due to slow kinetics, while the situation was significantly improved at 333.15 K. The kinetic data for the extraction yields of the 3 flavonoids achieved good fits by the first-order kinetic model. From the thermodynamic analysis results, we realized that the ultrasound-assisted extraction of taxifolin, diosmin, and quercetin from the leaves and bark of A. nephrolepis was a spontaneous and endothermic process in which the disorder increased (DeltaG0 < 0, DeltaH0 > 0, and DeltaS0 > 0). According to the response surface methodology (RSM) analysis, under the optimal operation conditions (ethanol concentration of 50%, liquid-solid ratio of 20 mL/g, frequency of 45 kHz, extraction time of 39.25 min, ultrasound irradiation power of 160 W and temperature of 332.19 K), the total yield of the 3 flavonoids were 100.93 +- 4.01 mg/g from the leaves of A. nephrolepis (with 31.03 +- 1.51 mg/g, 0.31 +- 0.01 mg/g, 69.59 +- 2.57 mg/g for taxifolin, diosmin, and quercetin, respectively), and under the optimal operation conditions (ethanol concentration of 50%, liquid-solid ratio of 20 mL/g, frequency of 45 kHz, extraction time of 36.80 min, ultrasound irradiation power of 150 W and temperature of 328.78 K), 16.05 mg/g +- 0.38 mg/g were obtained from the bark of A. nephrolepis (with 1.44 +- 0.05 mg/g, 0.47 +- 0.01 mg/g, 14.14 +- 0.38 mg/g for taxifolin, diosmin, and quercetin, respectively), which were close to the prediction values.	a. nephrolepis diosmin

2	An Arrow Poison (Abrus Precatorius) Causing Fatal Poisoning in a Child.Ingestion of whole seeds of Abrus precatorius often does not produce serious illness. It generally presents initially with gastrointestinal manifestations. Haemolysis, acute renal damage, hepatotoxicity and seizures are the other manifestations. Herewith we report a child with accidental ingestion of abrus precatorius seeds who presented with altered sensorium and convulsions. The case is being reported on account of its rarity in its initial neurological manifestation and has not been reported earlier in paediatric age group. 	abrus precatorius acute renal damage
2	Effect of Zizyphus jujuba extract on the inhibition of adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes.Obesity, the leading metabolic disease in the world, is a serious health problem in industrialized countries. The Zizyphus jujuba fruit has been used as traditional Chinese medicinal herb and considered to affect various physiological functions in the body for thousands of years. We investigated the anti-obesity effect of Z. jujuba on adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and found that treatment with an extract of Z. jujuba suppressed lipid accumulation and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) activity without affecting cell viability. Further fractionation of the initial Z .jujuba extract with organic solvent revealed that the chloroform fraction (CHCl(3)-F) elicited the most inhibitory effect, which involved significant attenuation of the expression of key adipogenic transcription factors, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma and CCAAT enhancer binding proteins (C/EBPs) at the protein level. These results suggest that CHCl(3)-F may block adipogenesis, at least in part, by decreasing the expression of PPARgamma, C/EBPalpha and beta.	z .jujuba obesity
1	Microwave-assisted extraction of jujube polysaccharide: Optimization, purification and functional characterization.The operational parameters involved in microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) of jujube polysaccharide including microwave power, water to raw material ratio and extraction temperature and time were optimized by RSM. MAE at 400W, 75 C, 60 min, using 30 g water/g powdered jujube was the best condition for maximum yield (9.02%) of polysaccharide. Two novel water-soluble polysaccharides (JCP-1 and JCP-2) with average molecular weights of 9.1x10(4)-1.5x10(5)Da in term of the symmetrical narrow peaks were identified using the analytical purification procedures. The JCP-1 and JCP-2 mainly composed of glucose, arabinose, galactose and rhamnose in molar ratios of 1.4:2.1:4.2:0.9 and 1.2:1.8:4.1:1.1, respectively. The use of 1.5% JCP-1 led to a high emulsifying stability (95.5%) in a model oil-in-water type emulsion with a reduced surface tension (44.1 mN/m) and droplet size (1.32 mum), and an increased apparent viscosity (0.13 Pas) during 21-day cold storage. The antioxidant activities were increased in dose-dependent manners (25-200 mug/mL).	jujube galactose
1	Differentiating parts of Cinnamomum cassia using LC-qTOF-MS in conjunction with principal component analysis.Cinnamon bark (Rou Gui in Chinese), cinnamon twig (Gui Zhi) and shaved cinnamon bark (Gui Sin) have been widely used as spices and in traditional Chinese medicine since ancient times. On-going issues related to quality and authenticity necessitate the development of analytical methods capable of providing an objective evaluation of samples. In this study, chemical fingerprints of cinnamon bark, cinnamon twigs and shaved cinnamon bark were established using liquid chromatography quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometry in conjunction with principal component analysis (PCA). From 125 samples of cinnamon, we identified the following eight compounds and their the detection ratios: coumarin, cinnamaldehyde, cinnamyl alcohol, cinnamic acid, 2-hydroxycinnamaldehyde, 2-hydroxycinnamic acid, 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde and 4-methoxycinnamaldehyde. Of these, 4-methoxycinnamaldehyde presented the largest variations in detection ratio, making up 64.0, 97.4 and 50.0% in cinnamon bark, cinnamon twig, and shaved cinnamon bark, respectively. The quantities of cinnamyl alcohol, coumarin and cinnamaldehyde also varied between the three parts of the plant. Chemical fingerprints of the three cinnamon samples were established using principal component analysis, the results of which indicate that cinnamon bark and shaved cinnamon bark could be easily differentiated, despite a marked similarity in outward appearance. Cinnamon twig was also shown to depart from the other clusters. The proposed method provides a fast and efficient means of identifying cinnamon herbs for quality control purposes.

2	Tyrosinase inhibitor isolated from the leaves of Zanthoxylum piperitum.Two flavonols, quercetin (1) and quercitrin (2), were isolated from the leaves of Zanthoxylum piperitum. Their structures were established by UV, one- and two-dimensional NMR, and mass spectroscopic methods. Quercetin showed significant inhibition against mushroom tyrosinase with an IC50 value of 3.8 microg/ml, and appeared to inhibit the polyphenol oxidase activity of tyrosinase in a competitive manner (Ki = 10 +/- 0.20 microM) when L-tyrosine was used as a substrate, although it did not inhibit the melanin production of Streptomyces bikiniensis.	zanthoxylum piperitum quercitrin
4	MAPK inhibitors and pifithrin-alpha block cinnamaldehyde-induced apoptosis in human PLC/PRF/5 cells.Cinnamaldehyde (Cin) has been shown to be effective in inducing apoptotic cell death in a number of human cancer cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of pifithrin-alpha (PFTalpha; a specific p53 inhibitor) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) inhibitors [namely SP600125 (a specific JNK inhibitor), SB203580 (a specific p38 inhibitor) and PD98059 (a specific ERK inhibitor)] on apoptotic signaling transduction mechanism induced by Cin in human hepatoma PLC/PRF/5 (CD95-negative) cells. Using XTT assay, Cin exhibited a powerful cytotoxic effect and apoptotic induction in PLC/PRF/5 cells. Apoptosis was elicited when cells were treated with 1 microM Cin as characterized by morphological changes and the appearance of phosphatidylserine on the outer surface of the plasma membrane. Cin down-regulated the expression of Bcl-(XL), up-regulated mutant p53 and Bax proteins and promoted caspase-3 to active forms, as well as cleaving poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in a time-dependent pattern. This could be supported by the activation and phosphorylation of MAPKs, including JNK, ERK and p38 kinases. Pre-incubation with PFTalpha and specific MAPK inhibitors significantly diminished the effect of Cin-induced apoptosis. The activities of anti-apoptotic (Bcl-(XL)) and pro-apoptotic (Bax) proteins were remarkably affected by PFTalpha and PD98059 pre-treatment. PFTalpha effectively blocked PARP cleavage in cells treated with Cin, and also markedly prevented the phosphorylation of JNK, p38 and ERK proteins. These results suggest that p53 induction and MAPK signaling pathways are required for Cin-mediated apoptosis in PLC/PRF/5 cells.	p38 cancer
1	Cinnamaldehyde inhibits lymphocyte proliferation and modulates T-cell differentiation.Two kinds of cinnamaldehyde derivative, 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (HCA) and 2'-benzoxy-cinnamaldehyde (BCA), were studied for their immunomodulatory effects. These compounds were screened as anticancer drug candidates from stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia for their inhibitory effect on farnesyl protein transferase activity. Ras activation, which is accompanied with its farnesylation, has been known to be important in immune cell activation as well as in carcinogenesis. Treatment of these cinnamaldehydes to mouse splenocyte cultures induced suppression of lymphoproliferation following both Con A and LPS stimulation in a dose-dependent manner. A dose of I microM of HCA and BCA inhibited the Con A-stimulated proliferation by 69% and 60%, and the LPS-induced proliferation by 29% and 21%, respectively. However, the proliferation induced by PMA plus ionomycin was affected by neither HCA nor BCA treatment. Decreased levels of antibody production by HCA or BCA treatment were observed in both SRBC-immunized mice and LPS-stimulated splenocyte cultures. The exposure of thymocytes to HCA or BCA for 48 h accelerated T-cell differentiation from CD4 and CD8 double positive cells to CD4 or CD8 single positive cells. The inhibitory effect of cinnamaldehyde on lymphoproliferation was specific to the early phase of cell activation, showing the strongest inhibition of Con A- or LPS-stimulated proliferation when added concomitantly with the mitogens. In addition, the treatment of HCA and BCA to splenocyte cultures attenuated the Con A-triggered progression of cell cycle at G1 phase with no inhibition of S to G2/M phase transition. Although cinnamaldehyde treatment had no effect on the IL-2 production by splenocyte cultures stimulated with Con A, it inhibited markedly and dose-dependently the expression of IL-2Ralpha and interferon-gamma. Taken together, the results in this study suggest both HCA and BCA inhibit the lymphoproliferation and induce a T-cell differentiation through the blockade of early steps in signaling pathway leading to cell growth.	cinnamomum cassia 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde
4	Zanthoxyli Fructus induces growth arrest and apoptosis of LNCaP human prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo in association with blockade of the AKT and AR signal pathways.Zanthoxyli Fructus belongs to the family of oranges and is used as a seasoning in Asian countries including Japan. This study found that a water extract of Zanthoxyli Fructus possessed anti-tumor activity against a wide variety of cancer cells including those from prostate (LNCaP, DU145, PC-3), breast (MCF-7, T47D, MDA-MB231), lung (NCI-H460, -H520), as well as leukemia (HL-60, NB4, Jurkat) in vitro, as measured by the trypan blue exclusion test. Importantly, Zanthoxyli Fructus slowed the proliferation of LNCaP, DU145, and MDA-MB231 cells present as xenografts in BALB/c nude mice without adverse effects. Further studies explored the molecular mechanism by which Zanthoxyli Fructus inhibited the proliferation of androgen-dependent human prostate cancer LNCaP cells because Zanthoxyli Fructus possessed the strongest anti-tumor activity against these cells. Zanthoxyli Fructus blocked androgen receptor (AR) signaling in conjunction with down-regulation of nuclear levels of AR and induced apoptosis of these cells, as measured by the reporter assay, Western blot analysis, and TUNEL assay, respectively. As expected, Zanthoxyli Fructus also decreased the level of the AR-target molecule, prostate-specific antigen in these cells. Furthermore, Zanthoxyli Fructus inhibited AKT kinase and down-regulated levels of cyclin D1 protein, as measured by the AKT kinase assay with GSK-3alpha/beta as a substrate and Western blot analysis, respectively. Taken together, Zanthoxyli Fructus might be useful as an adjunctive therapeutic agent for the treatment of individuals with a variety of cancer types.	AKT prostate cancer
1	Insecticidal and fumigant activities of Cinnamomum cassia bark-derived materials against Mechoris ursulus (Coleoptera: attelabidae).The insecticidal and fumigant activities of Cinnamomum cassia (Blume) bark-derived materials against the oak nut weevil (Mechoris ursulus Roelofs) were examined using filter paper diffusion and fumigation methods and compared to those of the commercially available Cinnamomum bark-derived compounds (eugenol, salicylaldehyde, trans-cinnamic acid, and cinnamyl alcohol). The biologically active constituent of the Cinnamomum bark was characterized as trans-cinnamaldehyde by spectroscopic analysis. In a test with the filter paper diffusion method, trans-cinnamaldehyde showed 100 and 83.3% mortality at rates of 2.5 and 1.0 mg/filter paper, respectively. At 2.5 mg/paper, strong insecticidal activity was produced from eugenol (90.0% mortality) and salicylaldehyde (88. 9%), whereas trans-cinnamic acid revealed moderate activity (73.3%). At 5 mg/paper, weak insecticidal activity (50.0%) was produced from cinnamyl alcohol. In a fumigation test, the Cinnamomum bark-derived compounds were much more effective against M. ursulus larvae in closed cups than in open ones. These results indicate that the insecticidal activity of test compounds was attributable to fumigant action, although there is also significant contact toxicity. As a naturally occurring insect-control agent, the Cinnamomum bark-derived materials described could be useful as a new preventive agent against damage caused by M. ursulus.

1	[Determination of aurantio-obtusin and chrysophanol in cassiae semen by HPLC].OBJECTIVE: To improve the determination method of Cassiae Semen in China Pharmacopeia edition 2005. MMETHOD: Aurantio-obtusin and chrysophanol were separated on an Inertsil ODS-3 column with acetonitrile-0.1% phosphoric acid solutiona as mobile phase in gradient elution. RESULT: The linear ranges of aurantio-obtusin and chrysophanol were 2.3-230, 2.87-286 mg x L(-1), respectively. The average recover were 100.3% (RSD 3.1%), and 99.5% (RSD 2.5%) respectively. CONCLUSION: This method is specific, accurate and reproducible, and can be used for the assay of Cassiae Semen in the new edition of Chinese pharmacopoeia.	cassiae semen chrysophanol
1	Evaluation of the quality of Chinese and Vietnamese cassia using LC-MS and multivariate analysis.In the present study, the chemical composition of water extracts of Chinese and Vietnamese cassia (Cinnamomum cassia) were compared using multivariate analysis of LC-MS data. By principal component analysis of the LC-MS data, 6 compounds, cinnzeylanine (1), cinnzeylanol (2), anhydrocinnzeylanol (3), cinncasinol A (4), epicatechin (5) and procyanidin B2 (6), were identified as the marker compounds to characterize Chinese and Vietnamese cassia. It was clarified that Chinese cassia contains relatively larger amounts of epicatechin and procyanidin B2. On the other hand, Vietnamese cassia is characterized by a relatively larger amount of diterpenes. As catechin derivatives and diterpenes have different types of activity, it is important to choose the cassia that best suits the product for which it is to be used, whether in food or in herbal medicine.	cinnamomum cassia catechin
2	In vitro anti-Helicobacter pylori action of 30 Chinese herbal medicines used to treat ulcer diseases.Infection by Helicobacter pylori has been ascertained to be an important etiologic impetus leading usually to chronic active gastritis and gastric ulcer with growing incidences worldwide. Utilizing as the test pathogen a standard and five clinic strains of Helicobacter pylori, the antibacterial action was assessed in vitro with ethanol extracts of 30 Chinese herbal medicines which have been frequently prescribed since ancient times for treating gastritis-like disorders. Among the 30 tested materials, the ethanol extracts of Abrus cantoniensis (Fabaceae), Saussurea lappa (Asteraceae) and Eugenia caryophyllata (Myrtaceae) were strongly inhibitory to all test strains (MICs: approximately 40 microg/ml), and Hippophae rhamnoides (Elaeagnaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii (Liliaceae), Magnolia officinalis and Schisandra chinensis (Magnoliaceae), Corydalis yanhusuo (Papaveraceae), Citrus reticulata (Rutaceae), Bupleurum chinense and Ligusticum chuanxiong (Apiaceae) substantially active with MICs close to 60.0 microg/ml. As to antibacterial actions of the aqueous extracts of the same drugs, those derived from Cassia obtusifolia (Fabaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii and Eugenia caryophyllata were remarkably inhibitory against all the six Helicobacter pylori strains (MICs: approximately 60 microg/ml). The work compared almost quantitatively the magnitude of the anti-Helicobacter pylori actions of the 30 most prescribed gastritis-treating Chinese herbal drugs, and located as well some source plants where potent anti-Helicobacter pylori phytochemicals could be characterized.	schisandra chinensis ulcer diseases
1	In vitro activities of plant extracts on human Loa loa isolates and cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells.Loa loa, a filarial worm, can cause fatal encephalitis in humans. In an attempt to find alternatives to the standard treatments (ivermectin and diethylcarbamazine citrate), we tested 12 methanolic extracts of nine traditional plant remedies. The extracts (100-0.09 microg/ml) were incubated with 20 Loa loa microfilariae isolated from patients at 37 degrees C with 5% CO(2) in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal serum and antibiotics. Activity was evaluated 120 h later by counting live microfilariae under a microscope. Cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells was estimated by measuring 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2-5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide transformation to formazan at 450 nM in a spectrophotometer. The plants tested were Lophira alata, Greenwayodendron suaveolens, Uapaca togoensis, Zanthoxylum heitzii, Peperomia pellucida, Piptadeniastrum africanum, Petersianthus macrocarpus, Vernonia conferta, and Vernonia hymenolepis. Chemical screening showed that most of the extracts contained reducing sugars, tannin or polyphenols, sterols or triterpenes, saponosides, and alkaloids. None contained carotinoids and few contained flavonoids. The 50% lethal concentration ranged from 0.22 to 70.28 microg/ml, while the 50% inhibitory concentration for eukaryotic cells (IC(50)) ranged from 8.52 to 119.52 microg/ml. Extracts of P. macrocarpus (selectivity index = 72.16), P. africanum (13.69), Z. heitzii (12.11), and L. alata (9.26) were highly selective for L. loa.	l. alata triterpenes
2	Structure-function analysis and insights into the reduced toxicity of Abrus precatorius agglutinin I in relation to abrin.Abrin and agglutinin-I from the seeds of Abrus precatorius are type II ribosome-inactivating proteins that inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. The two toxins share a high degree of sequence similarity; however, agglutinin-I is weaker in its activity. We compared the kinetics of protein synthesis inhibition by abrin and agglutinin-I in two different cell lines and found that approximately 200-2000-fold higher concentration of agglutinin-I is needed for the same degree of inhibition. Like abrin, agglutinin-I also induced apoptosis in the cells by triggering the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway, although at higher concentrations as compared with abrin. The reason for the decreased toxicity of agglutinin-I became apparent on the analysis of the crystal structure of agglutinin-I obtained by us in comparison with that of the reported structure of abrin. The overall protein folding of agglutinin-I is similar to that of abrin-a with a single disulfide bond holding the toxic A subunit and the lectin-like B-subunit together, constituting a heterodimer. However, there are significant differences in the secondary structural elements, mostly in the A chain. The substitution of Asn-200 in abrin-a with Pro-199 in agglutinin-I seems to be a major cause for the decreased toxicity of agglutinin-I. This perhaps is not a consequence of any kink formation by a proline residue in the helical segment, as reported by others earlier, but due to fewer interactions that proline can possibly have with the bound substrate.	abrus precatorius toxicity
2	Cinnamon extract induces tumor cell death through inhibition of NFkappaB and AP1.BACKGROUND: Cinnamomum cassia bark is the outer skin of an evergreen tall tree belonging to the family Lauraceae containing several active components such as essential oils (cinnamic aldehyde and cinnamyl aldehyde), tannin, mucus and carbohydrate. They have various biological functions including anti-oxidant, anti-microbial, anti-inflammation, anti-diabetic and anti-tumor activity. Previously, we have reported that anti-cancer effect of cinnamon extracts is associated with modulation of angiogenesis and effector function of CD8+ T cells. In this study, we further identified that anti-tumor effect of cinnamon extracts is also link with enhanced pro-apoptotic activity by inhibiting the activities NFkappaB and AP1 in mouse melanoma model. METHODS: Water soluble cinnamon extract was obtained and quality of cinnamon extract was evaluated by HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) analysis. In this study, we tested anti-tumor activity and elucidated action mechanism of cinnamon extract using various types of tumor cell lines including lymphoma, melanoma, cervix cancer and colorectal cancer in vitro and in vivo mouse melanoma model. RESULTS: Cinnamon extract strongly inhibited tumor cell proliferation in vitro and induced active cell death of tumor cells by up-regulating pro-apoptotic molecules while inhibiting NFkappaB and AP1 activity and their target genes such as Bcl-2, BcL-xL and survivin. Oral administration of cinnamon extract in melanoma transplantation model significantly inhibited tumor growth with the same mechanism of action observed in vitro. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that anti-tumor effect of cinnamon extracts is directly linked with enhanced pro-apoptotic activity and inhibition of NFkappaB and AP1 activities and their target genes in vitro and in vivo mouse melanoma model. Hence, further elucidation of active components of cinnamon extract could lead to development of potent anti-tumor agent or complementary and alternative medicine for the treatment of diverse cancers.	cinnamomum cassia melanoma
2	Spectroscopic analysis of the cytoagglutinating activity of abrin-b isolated from Abrus precatorius seeds against leukemic cells.The cytoagglutinating activity of abrin-b, a toxic lectin isolated from Abrus precatorius seeds, against cultured cell strains derived from acute lymphoblast leukemia (ALL) was investigated by visible (VIS) spectroscopy. Upon addition of abrin-b, the turbidity at 600 nm of cell suspension decreased and this change could be recorded as the cytoagglutination curve. From this curve, the cytoagglutination velocity (CV) and cytoagglutination intensity (CI) of each cell strain was measured. Each cell strain showed the respective CV and CI values and the cell strains derived from the T cell line were strongly agglutinated by abrin-b compared with those derived from the B cell line. Further, it has become apparent that the cytoagglutinating activity increased with an increase in the order of the differentiation of cell strains.	abrus precatorius acute lymphoblast leukemia
1	Inhibitory effect of 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde on nitric oxide production through inhibition of NF-kappa B activation in RAW 264.7 cells.Cinnamomum cassia has been widely used for treating dyspepsia, gastritis, and inflammatory disease. In the present study, several of cinnamaldehyde derivatives were synthesized from various cinnamic acid based on the 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde isolated from the bark C. cassia Blume was investigated to compare their NO production and NF-kappa B activity from Raw 264.7 cell since nitric oxide (NO) and NF-kappa B have been shown to be implicated factors in the inflammatory disease. The results show that HCA, among the derivatives, most significantly inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NO production and NF-kappa B transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner with an IC(50) value of 8 and 22 microM, respectively. We next investigated putative possible mechanisms of inhibitory effect of HCA on NO production. The inhibition of NO by HCA was consistent with the inhibitory effect on LPS-induced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression. Moreover, HCA inhibited LPS-induced p50 and p65 translocation resulting in the inhibition of the DNA binding activity of the NF-kappa B, a central regulator of iNOS. The present results provided evidence that HCA, among cinnamaledhyde derivatives, has the most inhibitory effect on NO production through inhibition of NF-kappa B activation, and thus can be used as an anti-inflammatory agent.	c. cassia cinnamaldehyde
2	The effect of cinnamon cassia powder in type 2 diabetes mellitus.BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder and the incidence of cardiovascular is increased two- to fourfold in its complications. Cinnamon is expected to have some degree of anti-diabetic efficacy without troublesome side effects. The objective of the present study was to investigate the anti-diabetic effect of cinnamon cassia powder in type 2 diabetic patients MATERIAL AND METHOD: Sixty type 2 diabetic patients were randomized either 1.5 g/d of cinnamon cassia powder or placebo. Both groups were in combination with their current treatment (metformin or sulfonylurea) according to single blind randomized, placebo-control trial in a 12-week period. Efficacy was evaluated by HbA1c fasting plasma glucose, Lipid profile, BUN, creatinine, liver function test and adverse effects were recorded. RESULTS: After a 12-week period, HbA1c was decreased similarly in both groups from 8.14% to 7.76% in the cinnamon group and from 8.06% to 7.87% in the placebo group. This was not found statistically significantly different. However the proportion of patients achieving HbA1c &lt; or = 7% was also greater in patients receiving cinnamon compared with patients receiving placebo, nevertheless, it was not found statistically significantly different (35% vs 15%, x2 = 3.14, p &gt; 0.05). No significant intergroup differences were observed in lipid profile, fasting plasma glucose except in SGOT 27.1 (8.75) to 22.1 (5) in cinnamon group and 24.08 (8.5) to 23.63 (8.88) in the placebo group (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The cinnamon cassia powder 1.5 g/d did not have any significant difference in reducing fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c and serum lipid profile in type 2 diabetes patients who had mean fasting plasma glucose 154.40 +/- 24.72 mg/dl.	cinnamon diabetes
0	Corilagin suppresses RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and inhibits oestrogen deficiency-induced bone loss via the NF-kappaB and PI3K/AKT signalling pathways.Over-activated osteoclastogenesis, which is initiated by inflammation, has been implicated in osteoporosis. Corilagin, a natural compound extracted from various medicinal herbaceous plants, such as Cinnamomum cassia, has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. We found that Corilagin suppressed osteoclast differentiation in a dose-dependent manner, significantly decreased osteoclast-related gene expression and impaired bone resorption by osteoclasts. Moreover, phosphorylation of members of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and PI3K/AKT signalling pathways was reduced by Corilagin. In a murine model of osteoporosis, Corilagin inhibited osteoclast functions in vivo and restored oestrogen deficiency-induced bone loss. In conclusion, our findings suggested that Corilagin inhibited osteoclastogenesis by down-regulating the NF-kappaB and PI3K/AKT signalling pathways, thus showing its potential possibility for the treatment of osteoporosis.

1	Comparison of drip, pipe and surge spring root irrigation for Jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) fruit quality in the Loess plateau of China.Loess Plateau is a typical rain-fed farming region, facing the threat of drought. Irrigation method is among the most important factors affecting jujube quality. This study investigated the response of Ziziphus jujuba Mill. cv. Lizao quality to three different irrigation methods (drip-, pipe- and surge spring root irrigation) combining two water levels (20 m(3)/hm(2) and 120 m(3)/hm(2)). The effects of the trials were evaluated by taking into account the physical-chemical characteristics of jujubes and the antioxidant activity. Concomitant to this, the concentration of some taste-related (viz. glucose, fructose, TSS and malic acid) and health-related compounds/parameters (viz. catechin and epicatechin) were generally much greater in jujube fruit treated with drip irrigation (120 m(3)/hm(2)). Different irrigation treatments had no significant effects on antioxidant capacity, total phenolics and proanthocyanidins (except for pipe irrigation 20 m(3)/hm(2)). The best compromise between quality and irrigation of jujube fruit was achieved with drip irrigation (120 m(3)/hm(2)). 	jujube malic acid
2	Antimicrobial effect of extracts from Chinese chive, cinnamon, and corni fructus.Extracts were prepared from Chinese chive (Allium tuberosum), cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia), and corni fructus (Cornus officinalis) and used to evaluate their antimicrobial activity on common foodborne microorganisms, alone and in combination. The mixed extract, consisting of three extracts in equal volumes, showed an entire antimicrobial spectrum and had excellent stability to heat, pH, and storage. The mixed extract exhibited better inhibition on growth of Escherichia coli than potassium sorbate at 2-5 mg/mL. The mixed extract inhibited the growth of Pichia membranaefaciens at levels as low as 2 mg/mL. When the mixed extract was used in foods, the expected antimicrobial effect in orange juice, pork, and milk was observed. After gel filtration chromatography, each extract was partially purified into fractions, and one fraction in each extract showed enhanced antimicrobial activity. Overall, the mixed extract was of promising potential for incorporation into various food products for which a natural antimicrobial additive is desired.	allium tuberosum antimicrobial activity
1	Cinnamaldehyde affects the biological behavior of human colorectal cancer cells and induces apoptosis via inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.Cinnamaldehyde (CA) is a bioactive compound isolated from the stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia, that has been identified as an antiproliferative substance with pro-apoptotic effects on various cancer cell lines in vitro. In the present study, the effects of CA on human colon cancer cells were investigated at both the molecular and cellular levels. Three types of colorectal cancer cells at various stages of differentiation and invasive ability (SW480, HCT116 and LoVo) were treated with CA at final concentrations of 20, 40 and 80 microg/ml for 24 h. Compared with the control group, the proliferation inhibition rate of the human colorectal cancer cells following treatment with CA increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The invasion and adhesion abilities of the cells were significantly inhibited as indicated by Transwell and cell-matrix adhesion assays. Meanwhile, CA also upregulated the expression of E-cadherin and downregulated the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9. CA also elevated the apoptotic rate. The levels of pro-apoptotic genes were upregulated while the levels of apoptosis inhibitory genes were decreased which further confirmed the pro-apoptotic effect of CA. In order to explore the mechanism of CA-induced apoptosis, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) were used to regulate the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway. The transcription activity of PI3K/AKT was markedly inhibited by CA, as well as IGF-1 which functions as an anti-apoptotic factor. In conclusion, CA has the potential to be developed as a new antitumor drug. The mechanisms of action involve the regulation of expression of genes involved in apoptosis, invasion and adhesion via inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.	cinnamomum cassia Cinnamaldehyde
4	Development and characterization of immobilized cannabinoid receptor (CB1/CB2) open tubular column for on-line screening.Cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, are therapeutic targets in the treatment of anxiety, obesity, movement disorders, glaucoma, and pain. We have developed an on-line screening method for CB1 and CB2 ligands, where cellular membrane fragments of a chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line, KU-812, were immobilized onto the surface of an open tubular (OT) capillary to create a CB1/CB2-OT column. The binding activities of the immobilized CB1/CB2 receptors were established using frontal affinity chromatographic techniques. This is the first report that confirms the presence of functional CB1 and CB2 receptors on KU-812 cells. The data from this study confirm that the CB1/CB2-OT column can be used to determine the binding affinities (K(i) values) for a single compound and to screen individual compounds or a mixture of multiple compounds. The CB1/CB2-OT column was also used to screen a botanical matrix, Zanthoxylum clava-herculis, where preliminary results suggest the presence of a high-affinity phytocannabinoid.	CB1 pain
2	Biochemical analysis and antitumour effect of Abrus precatorius agglutinin derived peptides in Ehrlich's ascites and B16 melanoma mice tumour model.Anticancer and immunostimulatory properties of tryptic digest peptides of Abrus precatorius agglutinin protein (10kDAGP) have already been reported. Here attempt has been made to further validate anticancer properties of 10kDAGP peptides in Ehrlich's ascites carcinoma (EAC) and B16 melanoma (B16M) bearing mice models and to analyze 10kDAGP by anion exchange chromatography and RP-HPLC for obtaining the bioactive fraction from the total peptide pool. 10kDAGP treatment decreased the tumour pack volume by ~82% for EAC and 58.8% for B16M. It also showed increase in ex vivo proliferation of splenocyte and thymocyte isolated from tumour bearing mice and increase in TNF-alpha and Interferon-gamma in splenocyte culture supernatant. From chromatographic analysis it was found that anionic peptide fraction may be responsible for anti-proliferative activities of 10kDAGP. As most anticancer peptides are cationic in nature, further studies regarding bioactivity of anionic peptide fraction may lead to novel anticancer peptides and pathways of action.	abrus precatorius ehrlich's ascites carcinoma
1	Pharmacognostic and phytochemical studies of Zanthoxylum armatum DC.The pharmacognostic and phytochemical investigations on the leaf, stem bark, and fruit of Zanthoxylum armatum were carried out. Macroscopic study of leaf, stem bark, and fruit of Z. armatum revealed some of the characteristic features like size, shape, color, odor and taste of the crude drug. Distinguishing fragments were identified from the powder drug. Leaf, bark, and fruit powder of this plant have higher values of total, acid insoluble, and water soluble ash as compared to the powder of this plant exhausted with ethanol and n- hexane. Extraction values in methanol were highest for leaves (20.10%) and fruit (11%), while bark showed highest value in chloroform (8.5%). The extractive values varied among other parts with different solvents. Fluorescence analysis of the Z. Armatum leaf, stem bark, and fruit powder with various reagents showed characteristic coloration at day and under UV light. Quantitative phytochemical screening revealed the presence of many bioactive constituents in leaves, such as alkaloids (15.60+-0.10 mg/g), sterols (71.60+-0.10mg/g), saponins (21.57+-0.12mg/g), tannins (34.43+-0.21mg/g), phenols (11.66+-0.33mg/g) and flavonoids (13.68+-0.66mg/g). Alkaloids (19.60+-0.10mg/g), sterols (33.83+-0.29mg/g), saponins (14.78+-0.10mg/g), tannins (28.62+-0.13mg/g), phenols (16.48+-1.33mg/g) and flavonoids (18.33+-1.22mg/g) were reported form the bark, while fruits were reported to have alkaloids (25.07+-0.21mg/g), sterols (164.92+-0.14mg/g), saponins (28.60+-0.10mg/g), tannins (35.5+-0.5mg/g), phenols (21.68+-0.44mg/g) and flavonoids (22.8+-1.33mg/g). Z. armatum is an important medicinal plant, traditionally used for various ailments. This study will be helpful in the future pharmacognostic standardization of this important plant.	z. armatum tannins
1	Purification, structural characterization, and hypolipidemic effects of a neutral polysaccharide from Ziziphus Jujuba cv. Muzao.A neutral polysaccharide (PZMP1) with a molecular weight of 16.97 kDa was isolated from Ziziphus Jujuba cv. Muzao with water extraction, ethanol precipitation, and purification with DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow and Sephacryl S-300 column chromatography. PZMP1 was structurally characterized with high-performance gel-permeation chromatography, gas chromatography, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, methylation analysis, NMR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. The results show that PZMP1 is a homogeneous heteropolysaccharide composed of arabinose, galactose, glucose, mannose, and xylose in a molar percentage of 17.36: 3.29:2.68:1.05:1.00. The majorly backbone of PZMP1 is composed of 1,3,5-linked Araf, 1,3-linked Araf, 1,5-linked Araf, 1,4-linked Glcp, and 1-linked Araf, 1-linked Glcp. According to an NMR analysis, the repeating unit of PZMP1 is a linear backbone with branches at positions O-3, and O-5. PZMP1 also displays effective dose-dependent hypolipidemic activity, suggesting that it is a natural hypolipidemic agent, which could contribute to the functional food qualities of jujube fruit.	jujube mannose
1	Quantitative and pattern recognition analyses of magnoflorine, spinosin, 6'''-feruloyl spinosin and jujuboside A by HPLC in Zizyphi Semen.Two rapid and simple HPLC methods with UV detector to determine three main compounds (magnoflorine, spinosin and 6'''-feruloyl spinosin) and evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD) to determine jujuboside A were developed for the chemical analyses of Zizyphi Semen. Magnoflorine, spinosin, and 6'''-feruloyl spinosin were separated with an YMC J'sphere ODS-H80 column (250 mm x 4.6 mm, 4 mum) by the gradient elution followed by the isocratic elution using methanol with 0.1 % formic acid and water with 0.1 % formic acid as the mobile phase. The flow rate was 1.0 mL/min. Jujuboside A was separated by HPLC-ELSD with YoungJinBioChrom Aegispak C18-L column (250 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 mum) column in a gradient elution using methanol with 0.1 % formic acid (A) and water with 0.1 % formic acid as the mobile phase. These two methods were fully validated with respect to linearity, precision, accuracy, stability, and robustness. These HPLC methods were applied successfully to quantify four compounds in a Zizyphi Semen extract. The HPLC analytical methods were validated for pattern recognition analysis by repeated analysis of 91 seed samples corresponding to 48 Zizyphus jujuba var. spinosa (J01-J48) and 43 Zizyphus mauritiana (M01-M43). The results indicate that these methods are suitable for a quality evaluation of Zizyphi Semen.	z. schinifolium alkaloids
3	Protective effects of 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde an active ingredients of Cinnamomum cassia on warm hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury in rat model.Objectives: Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) is one of the major causes of hepatic failure during liver transplantation, trauma, and infections. The present study investigated the protective effect of intra-portal administration of 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde (2-MCA) on hepatic IRI in rats. Materials and Methods: Twenty-four rats were equally divided into four groups; 1) sham group, (no IRI or transfusion), 2) Hepatic IRI (60 min ischemia + 120 min reperfusion, 3) Hepatic IRI+ NS (IRI + normal saline), 4) Hepatic IRI+2-MCA, (IRI + 2-MCA). In groups 3 and 4, 1 ml/kg normal saline and 2-MCA were administered slowly into the vein of the left lateral and median lobes of the liver 10 min before induction of hepatic reperfusion (upper the site of clumping), respectively. The harvest time points were at 2 hours post-reperfusion in all groups. Results: Histologically, cell death, degenerative changes, sinusoidal dilatation, congestion, hemorrhage, and infiltration of inflammatory cells were observed in IRI group, while these pathological changes were attenuated in the 2-MCA administrated group. The level of alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, tumor necrosis factor- alpha and interleukin-6 in serum and hepatic malondialdehyde were significantly increased by IRI, and 2-MCA administration reduced all these markers. In addition, caspase-3 and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) expression were investigated immunohistochemically. Administration of 2-MCA considerably decreased caspase-3 positive cells and NF-kappaB activity in comparison with IRI group. Conclusion: As a conclusion, in situ administration of 2-MCA protects against hepatic IRI via anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties.	2-MCA hepatic iri
1	Zizimauritic acids A-C, three novel nortriterpenes from Ziziphus mauritiana.Zizimauritic acids A-C (1-3), three novel nortriterpenes with a unique A-nor-E-seco spiro-lactone ceanothane-type triterpene skeleton, together with 3 known triterpenes ceanothenic acid (4), betulinic acid (5), and ceanothic acid (6), were isolated from the roots of Ziziphus mauritiana. Compounds 1-4 showed cytotoxicities with the IC(50) values ranging from 5.05 to 11.94 mug/ml, and compounds 1 and 3 showed an inhibitory effect on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus with the IC(50) values 2.17 and 12.79 mug/ml. A plausible biosynthetic pathway of compounds 1-3 was proposed.	ziziphus mauritiana betulinic acid
1	Authentication and quantitative analysis on the chemical profile of cassia bark (cortex cinnamomi) by high-pressure liquid chromatography.Cassia bark or cortex cinnamomi, the dried stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia Presl. (Lauraceae), is a popular natural spice and a commonly used herb in traditional Chinese medicine. However, adulterants are frequently found in the market. In this study, 44 samples of Cassia bark including bark from seven related Cinnamomum species were collected from fields and market. Four characteristic components, cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, and coumarin were determined by RP-HPLC, and a fingerprint comprised of five markers was established. These results showed that cassia barks contained high contents of cinnamaldehyde (13.01-56.93 mg/g). The highest content of cinnamaldehyde (up to 93.83 mg/g) was found in debarked cortex, which is traditionally regarded as having the best quality in local herb shops. In contrast, the adulterants from the other Cinnamomum species, C. wilsonii Camble, C. japonicum Sieb., C. mairei Levl. and C. burmanii (Nees) Blume, contained low contents of cinnamaldehyde (&lt;2.00 mg/g). The content of cinnamaldehyde in C. loureirii Nees was comparable to that in C. cassia. It is suggested that five characteristic peaks by HPLC are suitable for distinguishing genuine cassia bark from the adulterants and could be applied in the quality control of this commodity.	cassia bark cinnamic acid
2	Effect of four medicinal plants on amyloid-beta induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells.Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) is implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder. This study was designed to determine the effect of four medicinal plants used to treat neurodegenerative diseases on Abeta-induced cell death. Cytotoxicity of the ethanol extracts of the plants was determined against SH-SY5Y (human neuroblastoma) cells which were untreated, as well as toxically induced with Abeta, using the MTT and neutral red uptake assays. Cell viability was reduced to 16% when exposed to 20 microM Abeta25-35 for 72 h. The methanol extract of the roots of Ziziphus mucronata Willd., Lannea schweinfurthii (Engl.) Engl. and Terminalia sericea Burch. ex DC., were the least toxic to the SH-SY5Ycells at the highest concentration tested (100 microg/ml). All four plants tested were observed to reduce the effects of Abeta-induced neuronal cell death, indicating that they may contain compounds which may be relevant in the prevention of AD progression. 	terminalia sericea burch. ex dc AD
1	Evaluation of the quality of Chinese and Vietnamese cassia using LC-MS and multivariate analysis.In the present study, the chemical composition of water extracts of Chinese and Vietnamese cassia (Cinnamomum cassia) were compared using multivariate analysis of LC-MS data. By principal component analysis of the LC-MS data, 6 compounds, cinnzeylanine (1), cinnzeylanol (2), anhydrocinnzeylanol (3), cinncasinol A (4), epicatechin (5) and procyanidin B2 (6), were identified as the marker compounds to characterize Chinese and Vietnamese cassia. It was clarified that Chinese cassia contains relatively larger amounts of epicatechin and procyanidin B2. On the other hand, Vietnamese cassia is characterized by a relatively larger amount of diterpenes. As catechin derivatives and diterpenes have different types of activity, it is important to choose the cassia that best suits the product for which it is to be used, whether in food or in herbal medicine.	cinnamomum cassia anhydrocinnzeylanol
1	The Use of Essential Oils and Their Isolated Compounds for the Treatment of Oral Candidiasis: A Literature Review.In this literature review, we present the main scientific findings on the antifungal activity of essential oils (EOs) applicable for a new drug formulation to treat oral candidiasis. Seven literature databases were systematically searched for eligible in vitro and clinical trials. Selected articles were screened for biological activity, botanical species, phytochemical composition, study design, and methodological quality. A total of 26 articles were included in the review, of which 21 were in vitro studies and 5 clinical trials. The most promising EOs were obtained from Allium tubeorosum, Cinnamomum cassia, Cinnamomum zeylanicum, and Coriandrum sativum L. Among the phytochemicals, citral and thymol were the most active. Clinical trials indicated that the EOs from Pelargonium graveolens and Zataria multiflora are potentially effective to treat oral candidiasis. Further nonclinical and clinical studies with these EO are warranted to determine their potential use and safety for the treatment of oral candidiasis.	pelargonium graveolens EOs
1	Constituents of the essential oil of the Cinnamomum cassia stem bark and the biological properties.GC-MS analysis on the essential oil (CC-oil) of Cinnamomum cassia stem bark led to the identification of cinnamaldehyde (CNA, 1), 2-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (2-CNA), coumarin (2), and cinnamyl acetate. The major volatile flavor in CC-oil was found to be 2-CNA. Coumarin was first isolated from this plant by phytochemical isolation and spectroscopic analysis. CNA and CC-oil showed potent cytotoxicity, which was effectively prevented by N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) treatment. Intraperitoneal administration with CNA considerably decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) formation and glutathione S-transferase activity in rats. These results suggest that CC-oil and CNA can regulate the triggering of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes by the formation of a glutathione-conjugate.	cinnamomum cassia Coumarin

CONCLUSION: Compound 1 is a new compound named jujuboside D, 4 is reported as rotamer for the first time, 3 and 5 isolated from this plant for the first time.	ziziphus jujuba mill var phenylalanine
1	Ceylon cinnamon does not affect postprandial plasma glucose or insulin in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance.Previous studies on healthy subjects have shown that the intake of 6 g Cinnamomum cassia reduces postprandial glucose and that the intake of 3 g C. cassia reduces insulin response, without affecting postprandial glucose concentrations. Coumarin, which may damage the liver, is present in C. cassia, but not in Cinnamomum zeylanicum. The aim of the present study was to study the effect of C. zeylanicum on postprandial concentrations of plasma glucose, insulin, glycaemic index (GI) and insulinaemic index (GII) in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). A total of ten subjects with IGT were assessed in a crossover trial. A standard 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was administered together with placebo or C. zeylanicum capsules. Finger-prick capillary blood samples were taken for glucose measurements and venous blood for insulin measurements, before and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 min after the start of the OGTT. The ingestion of 6 g C. zeylanicum had no significant effect on glucose level, insulin response, GI or GII. Ingestion of C. zeylanicum does not affect postprandial plasma glucose or insulin levels in human subjects. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment in Europe has suggested the replacement of C. cassia by C. zeylanicum or the use of aqueous extracts of C. cassia to lower coumarin exposure. However, the positive effects seen with C. cassia in subjects with poor glycaemic control would then be lost.	c. cassia coumarin
1	Potential new inorganic antitumour agents from combining the anticancer traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) liriodenine with metal ions, and DNA binding studies.Liriodenine (), an active component of the anticancer traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), was isolated from Zanthoxylum nitidum. Its reactions with Pt(II) and Ru(II) afforded three metal complexes: cis-[PtCl2(L)] (), cis-[PtCl2(L)(DMSO)] (), and cis-[RuCl2(L)(DMSO)2].1.5H2O (), the crystal structures of , and were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction methods. These complexes were fully characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectrophotometry, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies, and ES mass spectrometry. The in vitro cytotoxicity of and complexes against 11 human tumour cell lines was assayed. The metal-based compounds exhibit enhanced cytotoxicity vs. free , suggesting that these compounds display synergy in the combination of metal ions and liriodenine. The binding properties of and its complexes to ct-DNA were investigated through UV-vis, fluorescence, CD spectra, viscosity and agarose gels electrophoretic measurements.	zanthoxylum nitidum liriodenine

2	Herbal medicines used in the treatment of malaria in Budiope county, Uganda.AIM OF THE STUDY: This study was conducted to document herbal medicines (HMs) used in the treatment of malaria as well as the existing knowledge, attitudes and practices related to malaria recognition, control and treatment in Budiope county, Uganda. METHODS: Data was collected using semi-structured interviews, and open- and close-ended questionnaires. RESULTS: The respondents had a good understanding of malaria, and could recognize it and distinguish it from other fever types. They were also aware that malaria was spread by mosquitoes. Malaria prevalence was high, and affected individuals an average of six times a year. Respondents avoided mosquito bites by using mosquito nets, clearing bush around their homesteads, and burning plant parts to generate smoke. They preferred treating malaria using allopathic medicines because, according to them, they lacked the appropriate traditional knowledge necessary to exploit plants for the treatment of malaria. Secondly, allopathic medicines were believed to be superior to HMs in the treatment of malaria. Twenty-seven species were used for the treatment of malaria. The most frequently mentioned were Vernonia amygdalina, Momordica foetida, Zanthoxylum chalybeum, Lantana camara and Mangifera indica. Drugs from these plants were prepared from single species as water extracts and were administered in variable doses over varied time periods.	lantana camara malaria
1	Composition of essential oil from seeds and cones of Abies alba.The volatile composition of Abies alba Mill. seeds and cone scales has been studied, leading to the determination of 90 volatile constituents. The major component of the seed essential oil was (-)-limonene (about 70%), while that of the cone scale oil was a-pinene (57%). Monoterpene hydrocarbons were predominant in both oils, but the quantitative and qualitative composition of the volatile compounds was specific for each part of the tree.	abies alba mill (-)-limonene
1	Dihydrobenzo[c]phenanthridine alkaloids from stem bark of Zanthoxylum nitidum.Five novel alkaloids, zanthomuurolanine ( 1), epi-zanthomuurolanine ( 2), zanthocadinanines A ( 3) and B ( 4), and epi-zanthocadinanine B ( 5), composed of dihydrochelerythrine and a cadinane-type sesquiterpene linked by a methylene bridge, have been isolated from stem bark of Zanthoxylum nitidum. These structures were elucidated by spectroscopic techniques (UV, IR, MS, CD, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, DEPT, COSY, NOESY, HSQC, and HMBC analyses). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies confirmed the relative configurations of 1 and 4 and provided additional support for the structures of 2, 3, and 5.	zanthoxylum nitidum zanthomuurolanine
2	HPLC method for measurement of human salivary alpha-amylase inhibition by aqueous plant extracts.Control of hyperglycemia is an important treatment in metabolic disorders such as type II diabetes and obesity. alpha-Amylase, as the first enzyme of glucose release from dietary polysaccharides, is a potential target to identify new sources of novel anti-obesity and anti-diabetic drugs. In this work, different herbal extracts as alpha-amylase inhibitors were studied by measuring the rate of the cleavage of a maltooligomer substrate 2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl-beta-D-maltoheptoside. Measurement of chromophore containing products after reversed phase HPLC separation was used for alpha-amylase activity measurement. Rates of hydrolysis catalysed by human salivary alpha-amylase were determined in the presence and absence of lyophilised water extracts of eleven herbs. Remarkable bioactivities were found for extracts of Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume (bark), Camellia sinensis L. (leaf), Ribes nigrum L. (leaf), Laurus nobilis L. (leaf), Vaccinium macrocarpon Aiton (fruit) and Syzygium aromaticum L. (bud). Determined IC50 values were in 0.017-41 mug/ml range for these six selected plant extracts. Our results confirm the applicability of this HPLC-based method for the quick and reliable comparison of plants as alpha-amylase inhibitors.	cinnamomum zeylanicum type ii diabetes
2	Therapeutic Effect of Abelmoschus manihot on Type 2 Diabetic Nonproliferative Retinopathy and the Involvement of VEGF.Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of Abelmoschus manihot in treating type 2 diabetic nonproliferative retinopathy. Methods: It was a randomized controlled clinical trial. The recruited eighty subjects with type 2 diabetic nonproliferative retinopathy were randomly divided into treatment group and control group. The two groups received basic treatments including control of blood glucose, blood pressure and blood lipid, management of diet, exercise and health education, and monitoring of relevant indicators. Additionally, the treatment group was given oral administration of Abelmoschus manihot. All subjects were followed up on monthly basis for consecutive six months. The related parameters including diabetic retinopathy (DR) incidence rates, "Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study" (ETDRS) vision scores, retinal thicknesses in macular region, serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels, and biochemical indicators of both groups before and after treatment were accurately collected and statistically analyzed. Results: There were no significant differences of DR severity levels, ETDRS vision scores, macular retinal thicknesses such as cube average thickness (CAT), central subfield thickness (CST), and cube volume (CV), and serum VEGF levels between two groups before treatment. Meanwhile, there were no significant differences of demographic characteristics, case terminations, blood glucose, blood lipid, blood pressure, biochemical indicators of hepatorenal function, hypoglycemic drugs, hypotensive drugs, and other basic treatments between two groups during six months treatment. The present study suggested that the remission rate of DR and the ETDRS vision score in the treatment group were significantly higher than those of the control group (remission rate: 25.4% vs 9.3%, P=0.01; ETDRS score: 78 (72, 82) vs 72 (67, 80), P=0.0002) while the progression rate of DR in the treatment group was significantly lower than that of the control group (progression rate: 4.2% vs 18.7%, P=0.007) after six months treatment. In addition, the CAT, CST, CV, and serum VEGF levels of the treatment group were significantly improved after the treatment (CAT: 286 (278, 302) vs 282 (270, 295) mum, P < 0.0001; CST: 251 (239, 274) vs 248 (235, 265) mum, P < 0.0001; CV: 10.3 (10.0, 10.9) vs 10.1 (9.7, 10.6) mm3, P < 0.0001; VEGF: 0.21 (0.14, 0.58) vs 0.16 (0.10, 0.23) ng/ml, P=0.0026), while there were no significant differences of the control group before and after treatment (CAT: 287 (279, 294) vs 287 (279, 295) mum, P=0.27; CST: 250 (240, 266) vs 252 (238, 266) mum, P=0.72; CV: 10.4 (10.1, 10.6) vs 10.4 (10.1, 10.7) mm3, P=0.53; VEGF: 0.21 (0.13, 0.66) vs 0.23 (0.12, 0.64) ng/ml, P=0.85). Conclusion: The study offered the novel evidence for the therapeutic effect of Abelmoschus manihot on type 2 diabetic nonproliferative retinopathy, which was associated with improved VEGF. This trial is registered with ChiCTR1800019292.	abelmoschus manihot diabetic nonproliferative retinopathy
2	Bioactive Compounds from Abelmoschus manihot L. Alleviate the Progression of Multiple Myeloma in Mouse Model and Improve Bone Marrow Microenvironment.Purpose: Abelmoschus manihot (L.) Medik. (Malvaceae) derived Huangkui capsules (HKC) represent a traditional Chinese medicine that has been widely applied to the clinical therapy of kidney and inflammatory diseases. The present study aimed to determine the potential therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of the ingredients on Multiple Myeloma (MM), an incurable disease that exhibits malignant plasma cell clonal expansion in the bone marrow. Methods: A 5TMM3VT syngeneic MM-prone model was established and treated with HKC. Murine pre-osteoblast MC3T3-E1 and pre-osteoclast Raw264.7 cells were treated with nine flavonoid compounds extracted from the flowers of Abelmoschus manihot. MC3T3-E1 and Raw264.7 cells were then examined by alizarin red staining and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity staining, respectively. The proliferation of two human MM cells (ARP1, H929) was examined by performing an MTT assay following treatment with flavonoid compounds. Additionally, the cell cycle was analyzed via staining and flow cytometry. The differential expressions of certain proteins were detected via Western blotting, transcriptomic RNA-sequencing as well as RT-qPCR. Results: The results revealed that MM-prone animals appeared to be protected following HKC treatment, as evidenced by a prolonged survival rate. Furthermore, four of the nine flavonoid compounds [Hyperin/Hyperoside, HK-2; Cannabiscitrin, HK-3; 3-O-kaempferol-3-O-acetyl-6-O-(p-coumaroyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside, HK-11; 8-(2''-pyrrolidione-5''-yl)-quercetin, HK-B10] induced the differentiation of murine pre-osteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells. In addition, two compounds [Isomyricitrin, HK-8; quercetin-8-(2''-pyrrolidione-5"-yl)-3'-O-beta-D-glucopyranosid, HK-E3] suppressed osteoclastogenesis in murine Raw264.7 cells. HK-11 directly inhibited MM cells (ARP1 and H929) proliferation and induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, which may have involved the suppressing beta-catenin protein, increasing expressions of IL-6 and TNF-alpha, as well as activating mature TGF-beta1 and some other metabolic pathways. Conclusion: These results of the present study indicated that the bio-active ingredients of HKC exerted protective effects on MM mouse survival through promoting osteoblastogenesis and suppressing osteoclastogenesis, thus improving the bone marrow microenvironment to inhibit MM cell proliferation.	abelmoschus manihot MM
4	MAPK inhibitors and pifithrin-alpha block cinnamaldehyde-induced apoptosis in human PLC/PRF/5 cells.Cinnamaldehyde (Cin) has been shown to be effective in inducing apoptotic cell death in a number of human cancer cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of pifithrin-alpha (PFTalpha; a specific p53 inhibitor) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) inhibitors [namely SP600125 (a specific JNK inhibitor), SB203580 (a specific p38 inhibitor) and PD98059 (a specific ERK inhibitor)] on apoptotic signaling transduction mechanism induced by Cin in human hepatoma PLC/PRF/5 (CD95-negative) cells. Using XTT assay, Cin exhibited a powerful cytotoxic effect and apoptotic induction in PLC/PRF/5 cells. Apoptosis was elicited when cells were treated with 1 microM Cin as characterized by morphological changes and the appearance of phosphatidylserine on the outer surface of the plasma membrane. Cin down-regulated the expression of Bcl-(XL), up-regulated mutant p53 and Bax proteins and promoted caspase-3 to active forms, as well as cleaving poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in a time-dependent pattern. This could be supported by the activation and phosphorylation of MAPKs, including JNK, ERK and p38 kinases. Pre-incubation with PFTalpha and specific MAPK inhibitors significantly diminished the effect of Cin-induced apoptosis. The activities of anti-apoptotic (Bcl-(XL)) and pro-apoptotic (Bax) proteins were remarkably affected by PFTalpha and PD98059 pre-treatment. PFTalpha effectively blocked PARP cleavage in cells treated with Cin, and also markedly prevented the phosphorylation of JNK, p38 and ERK proteins. These results suggest that p53 induction and MAPK signaling pathways are required for Cin-mediated apoptosis in PLC/PRF/5 cells.	PARP cancer
3	Trimer procyanidin oligomers contribute to the protective effects of cinnamon extracts on pancreatic beta-cells in vitro.AIM: Cinnamon extracts rich in procyanidin oligomers have shown to improve pancreatic beta-cell function in diabetic db/db mice. The aim of this study was to identify the active compounds in extracts from two species of cinnamon responsible for the pancreatic beta-cell protection in vitro. METHODS: Cinnamon extracts were prepared from Cinnamomum tamala (CT-E) and Cinnamomum cassia (CC-E). Six compounds procyanidin B2 (cpd1), (-)-epicatechin (cpd2), cinnamtannin B1 (cpd3), procyanidin C1 (cpd4), parameritannin A1 (cpd5) and cinnamtannin D1 (cpd6) were isolated from the extracts. INS-1 pancreatic beta-cells were exposed to palmitic acid (PA) or H2O2 to induce lipotoxicity and oxidative stress. Cell viability and apoptosis as well as ROS levels were assessed. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was examined in PA-treated beta-cells and murine islets. RESULTS: CT-E, CC-E as well as the compounds, except cpd5, did not cause cytotoxicity in the beta-cells up to the maximum dosage using in this experiment. CT-E and CC-E (12.5-50 mug/mL) dose-dependently increased cell viability in both PA- and H2O2-treated beta-cells, and decreased ROS accumulation in H2O2-treated beta-cells. CT-E caused more prominent beta-cell protection than CC-E. Furthermore, CT-E (25 and 50 mug/mL) dose-dependently increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in PA-treated beta-cells and murine islets, but CC-E had little effect. Among the 6 compounds, trimer procyanidins cpd3, cpd4 and cpd6 (12.5-50 mumol/L) dose-dependently increased the cell viability and decreased ROS accumulation in H2O2-treated beta-cells. The trimer procyanidins also increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in PA-treated beta-cells. CONCLUSION: Trimer procyanidins in the cinnamon extracts contribute to the pancreatic beta-cell protection, thus to the anti-diabetic activity.	procyanidin diabetic
4	Antiproliferative Activity of Cinnamomum cassia Constituents and Effects of Pifithrin-Alpha on Their Apoptotic Signaling Pathways in Hep G2 Cells.Cinnamaldehyde (Cin), cinnamic acid (Ca) and cinnamyl alcohol (Cal), major constituents of Cinnamomum cassia, have been shown to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer and other activities. In this study, our aim was to evaluate the antiproliferative activity of these compounds in human hepatoma Hep G2 cells and examine the effects of pifithrin-alpha (PFTalpha; a specific p53 inhibitor) on their apoptotic signaling transduction mechanism. The antiproliferative activity was measured by XTT assay. Expression of apoptosis-related proteins was detected by western blotting. Results showed that at a concentration of 30 muM, the order of antiproliferative activity in Hep G2 cells was Cin &gt; Ca &gt; Cal. Cin (IC(50) 9.76 +- 0.67 muM) demonstrated an antiproliferative potency as good as 5-fluorouracil (an anti-cancer drug; IC(50) 9.57 +- 0.61 muM). Further studies on apoptotic mechanisms of Cin showed that it downregulated the expression of Bcl-(XL), upregulated CD95 (APO-1), p53 and Bax proteins, as well as cleaving the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in a time-dependent pattern. PFTalpha pre-incubation significantly diminished the effect of Cin-induced apoptosis. It markedly upregulated the anti-apoptotic (Bcl-(XL)) expression and downregulated the pro-apoptotic (Bax) expression, as well as effectively blocking the CD95 (APO-1) and p53 expression, and PARP cleavage in Cin-treated cells. This study indicates that Cin was the most potent antiproliferative constituent of C. cassia, and its apoptotic mechanism in Hep G2 cells could be mediated through the p53 induction and CD95 (APO-1) signaling pathways.

2	The efficacy of Plygersic gel for use in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee.OBJECTIVE: An evaluation of the efficacy of the combination of ginger (Zingiber officinale) and plai (Zingiber cassumunar) gel for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee using 1% diclofenac gel as a comparator. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A double-blind, randomized, controlled trial of the combination of 4% ginger and plai extract in a gel (Plygersic gel) as compared with a 1% solution of diclofenac in patients with osteoarthritis knees. The number of participants in each group totaled fifty. The length of treatment was a 6 week period. The efficacy of the drugs was monitored by using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). The t-test was used to compare the scores before and after treatments in each group. The repeated ANOVA was used to compare the scores between the two groups. RESULTS: Both Plygersic gel and diclofenac gel could significantly improve knee joint pain, symptoms, daily activities, sports activities and quality of life measured by KOOS following 6 weeks of treatment. In the repeated ANOVA, there were no differences in the results between the Plygersic and diclofenac gel groups. CONCLUSION: Plygersic gel relieves joint pain and improves problematic symptoms and improves the quality of life in osteoarthritis knees during a 6 week treatment regimen with no differences to the 1% Diclofenac gel group.	ginger osteoarthritis
1	Identification of marker compounds for Japanese Pharmacopoeia non-conforming jujube seeds from Myanmar.Jujube seed is a crude drug defined as the seed of Ziziphus jujuba Miller var. spinosa Hu ex H.F. Chou (Rhamnaceae) in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia (JP). Most of the jujube seed in the Japanese markets is imported from China, with the rest obtained from other Asian countries. Here we confirmed the botanical origins of jujube seeds from both China and Myanmar by a DNA sequencing analysis. We found that the botanical origins of the crude drugs from China and Myanmar were Z. jujuba and Z. mauritiana, respectively. Although the jujube seed from China conforms to the JP, that from Myanmar does not. A method for discriminating jujube seeds from China and Myanmar using a chemical approach is thus desirable, and here we sought to identify a compound specific to Z. jujuba. Jujuboside A (1) was identified as a compound specific to Z. jujuba. To establish a purity test of Jujube Seed in the JP against Z. mauritiana, we fractionated the extract of Z. mauritiana seeds and identified frangufoline (2) and oleanolic acid (4) as the marker compounds specific to Z. mauritiana. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses revealed that the latter compound was useful for testing by TLC analysis. The established TLC conditions were as follows: chromatographic support, silica gel; developing solvent, n-hexane:EtOAc:HCOOH = 10:5:1; developing length, 7 cm; visualization, diluted sulfuric acid; R f value, 0.43 (oleanolic acid).	z. mauritiana frangufoline
1	Composition of essential oils from seeds of Abies koreana.The essential oils from seeds of nine Abies koreana specimens have been studied using GC-MS-FID and NMR methods, leading to the determination of 96 volatiles, which constituted over 99% of the oils. The hydrodistilled oils of fresh, resinous scent were isolated with yields in the range of 3.8-8.5%. The results showed that the essential oil of Korean fir seeds contained 70-95% monoterpenes and 1-20% oxygenated monoterpenes as the dominant groups. The numerous sesquiterpenes, diterpenes and their oxygenated derivatives constituted only 2-8% of the oil. The major component of the seed essential oil was limonene (41-72 g/100g); the laevorotary form of this terpene predominated. A. koreana seeds seem to be a rich source of both essential oil and (-)-limonene, whose average enantiomeric excess was above 95%.	a. koreana monoterpenes
1	New fatty acid esters originate during storage by the interaction of components in prasaplai, a Thai traditional medicine.Prasaplai is a Thai traditional preparation composed of twelve ingredients; during storage three newly emerging compounds were detected by HPLC. Their structures were established as the new (E)-4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-en-1-yl linoleate, (E)-4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-en-1-yl oleate and the known (E)-4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-en-1-yl palmitate on the basis of spectral data and chemical evidence. The artificial esters were already observable after one day of storage of the freshly prepared dry mixture, and steadily increased during a storage period of 30 days and more. A systematic search indicated that the three esters arose from the interaction of compounds contained in the rhizomes of Zingiber cassumunar and the seeds of Nigella sativa.	zingiber cassumunar (e)-4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-en-1-yl oleate
1	Effects of selected plant essential oils on the growth and development of mouse preimplantation embryos in vivo.Plant essential oils (EOs) have been reported to have health benefit properties and their preventive and therapeutic use in animals is expected to increase in the future. We evaluated the influence of five essential oils obtained from plant species which are known to have positive antimicrobial, antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects--sage EO from Salvia officinalis L. (Lamiaceae), oregano EO from Origanum vulgare L. (Lamiaceae), thyme EO from Thymus vulgaris L. (Lamiaceae), clove EO from Syzygium aromaticum L. (Myrtaceae) and cinnamon EO from Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume (Lauraceae) on the growth and development of mouse preimplantation embryos in vivo. Essential oils were added to commercial diet at concentrations of 0.25% for sage EO, thyme EO, clove EO, cinnamon EO and 0.1% for oregano EO, and fed to ICR female mice for 2 weeks ad libitum. Females were then mated with males of the same strain. Embryos obtained on Day 4 of pregnancy at the blastocyst stage were stained by morphological triple staining (Hoechst, PI, Calcein-AM) and evaluated using fluorescent microscopy. The effects of essential oils were estimated by the viability of embryos, number of nuclei and distribution of embryos according to nucleus number. Cinnamon EO significantly decreased the number of nuclei and the distribution of embryos according to nucleus number was significantly altered. Sage EO negatively influenced the distribution of embryos according to nucleus number. Clove and oregano EOs induced a significantly increased rate of cell death. Only thyme EO had no detectable effects on embryo development. In conclusion, none of the essential oils had any positive effect on embryo development, but some of them reduced the number of cells and increased the incidence of cell death.	salvia officinalis l essential oils
1	Analysis of volatile components, fatty acids, and phytosterols of Abies koreana growing in Poland.Extracts and essential oils from seeds as well as essential oils from cone scales and needles with twigs of the Abies koreana population were studied. An analysis of Korean fir essential oils allowed us to determine 147 volatile compounds. The identified compounds constituted 97-99% of the seed, cone and needle oils. The main volatile in the seed and needle oils was limonene (56.6% and 23.4%, respectively), while the predominant volatile in cone oils was alpha-pinene (51.2%). Korean fir seeds provided a rich source of both essential oil (3.8-8.5%) and extract, which was isolated with a 24.5% yield and contained numerous groups of fatty acids and phytosterols (414 microg/100g extract). The most prominent fatty acids were unsaturated, among which linoleic (41.2%) and oleic (31.2%) fatty acid were the main ones while the dominant sterols were isomers of ergostadienol and beta-sitosterol. A. koreana seeds, cones and needles are a source of many volatile bioactive compounds while the seed extract, with a pleasant scent, contained not only volatiles, but also fractions rich in fatty acids and phytosterols. These facts make A. koreana essential oils and especially the seed extract potential components of cosmetics.	a. koreana ergostadienol
3	Amelioration of cyclophosphamide induced myelosuppression and oxidative stress by cinnamic acid.Cinnamic acid (C9H8O2), is a major constituent of the oriental Ayurvedic plant Cinnamomum cassia (Family: Lauraceae). This phenolic acid has been reported to possess various pharmacological properties of which its antioxidant activity is a prime one. Therefore it is rational to hypothesize that it may ameliorate myelosuppression and oxidative stress induced by cyclophosphamide, a widely used chemotherapeutic agent. Commercial cyclophosphamide, Endoxan, was administered intraperitoneally to Swiss albino mice (50mg/kg) pretreated with 15, 30 and 60mg/kg doses of cinnamic acid orally at alternate days for 15days. Cinnamic acid pre-treatment was found to reduce cyclophosphamide induced hypocellularity in the bone marrow and spleen. This recovery was also reflected in the peripheral blood count. Amelioration of hypocellularity could be correlated with the modulation of cell cycle phase distribution. Cinnamic acid pre-treatment reduced bone marrow and hepatic oxidative stress as evident by lipid peroxidation and activity assays of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione-S-transferase. The present study indicates that cinnamic acid pretreatment has protective influence on the myelosuppression and oxidative stress induced by cyclophosphamide. This investigation is an attempt and is the first of its kind to establish cinnamic acid as an agent whose consumption provides protection to normal cells from the toxic effects of a widely used anti-cancer drug.	cinnamic acid myelosuppression
1	Evaluation of the quality of Chinese and Vietnamese cassia using LC-MS and multivariate analysis.In the present study, the chemical composition of water extracts of Chinese and Vietnamese cassia (Cinnamomum cassia) were compared using multivariate analysis of LC-MS data. By principal component analysis of the LC-MS data, 6 compounds, cinnzeylanine (1), cinnzeylanol (2), anhydrocinnzeylanol (3), cinncasinol A (4), epicatechin (5) and procyanidin B2 (6), were identified as the marker compounds to characterize Chinese and Vietnamese cassia. It was clarified that Chinese cassia contains relatively larger amounts of epicatechin and procyanidin B2. On the other hand, Vietnamese cassia is characterized by a relatively larger amount of diterpenes. As catechin derivatives and diterpenes have different types of activity, it is important to choose the cassia that best suits the product for which it is to be used, whether in food or in herbal medicine.	cinnamomum cassia procyanidin b2
3	Llama-derived single domain antibodies specific for Abrus agglutinin.Llama derived single domain antibodies (sdAb), the recombinantly expressed variable heavy domains from the unique heavy-chain only antibodies of camelids, were isolated from a library derived from llamas immunized with a commercial abrin toxoid preparation. Abrin is a potent toxin similar to ricin in structure, sequence and mechanism of action. The selected sdAb were evaluated for their ability to bind to commercial abrin as well as abrax (a recombinant abrin A-chain), purified abrin fractions, Abrus agglutinin (a protein related to abrin but with lower toxicity), ricin, and unrelated proteins. Isolated sdAb were also evaluated for their ability to refold after heat denaturation and ability to be used in sandwich assays as both capture and reporter elements. The best binders were specific for the Abrus agglutinin, showing minimal binding to purified abrin fractions or unrelated proteins. These binders had sub nM affinities and regained most of their secondary structure after heating to 95  C. They functioned well in sandwich assays. Through gel analysis and the behavior of anti-abrin monoclonal antibodies, we determined that the commercial toxoid preparation used for the original immunizations contained a high percentage of Abrus agglutinin, explaining the selection of Abrus agglutinin binders. Used in conjunction with anti-abrin monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, these reagents can fill a role to discriminate between the highly toxic abrin and the related, but much less toxic, Abrus agglutinin and distinguish between different crude preparations.	abrax toxicity
2	A standardized extract of the fruit of Ziziphus jujuba (Jujube) induces neuronal differentiation of cultured PC12 cells: a signaling mediated by protein kinase A.The fruit of Ziziphus jujuba Mill., known as Chinese date or jujube, is consumed as a health supplement worldwide. To study the role of jujube in brain benefits, its effects on neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells were studied. Application of jujube water extract induced neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells, &gt;25% of which were differentiated; this effect was similar to that of nerve growth factor. In parallel, the expressions of neurofilaments (NFs) in jujube-treated cultures showed a dose-dependent increase, with the highest inductions by ~150% for NF68 and NF160 and by ~100% for NF200. Application of H89, a protein kinase A inhibitor, attenuated jujube-induced neurite outgrowth of the cultures. Besides, using jujube extract induced the phosphorylation of cAMP responsive element binding protein on PC12 cells, which was blocked by H89. These results support the use of jujube as a food supplement for the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases in which neurotrophin deficiency is involved. 	jujube neurotrophin deficiency
1	Apoptosis induction of 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde as a proteasome inhibitor is associated with ER stress and mitochondrial perturbation in cancer cells.2'-Hydroxycinnamaldehyde (HCA), isolated from the stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia, and 2'-benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde (BCA), one of HCA derivatives, have antiproliferative activities on several human cancer cell lines. Our previous study suggested that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and caspase-3 are the major regulators of HCA-induced apoptosis. In the present study, we demonstrated a novel molecular target using in vitro pull-down assay by biotin-labeled HCA (biotin-HCA) in SW620 cells. We analyzed 11 differential spots of 2-dimensional gel prepared with pull-downed proteins by biotin-HCA. Among them, five spots were identified as proteasome subunits. An in vitro 26S proteasome function assay using specific fluorogenic substrates showed that HCA potently inhibits L3-like activity of the proteasome. In addition, HCA showed inhibitory action against chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and PGPH-like activities. DNA microarray showed that HCA induced heat shock family and ER stress-responsive genes, which reflects the accumulation of misfolded proteins by proteasome inhibition. On western blot analysis, it was confirmed that HCA induces glucose-regulated protein, 78 kDa (GRP78) and some representative endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-responsive proteins. Furthermore, HCA treatment decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. The effect of HCA on cytochrome c and Bax translocation between cytosol and mitochondrial membrane was clarified using western blot analysis. These results suggest that HCA-induced apoptosis is associated with the inhibition of the proteasome activity that leads in turn to the increase of ER stress and mitochondrial perturbation.	cinnamomum cassia 2'-benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde
2	Anthelmintic screening of Zimbabwean plants traditionally used against schistosomiasis.Extracts of 23 plant species used popularly against schistosomiasis in Zimbabwe were screened for their anthelmintic effect. Schistosomules of the trematode Schistosoma mansoni and cysticercoids of the cestode Hymenolepis diminuta were studied in vitro. The material consisted of 58 plant extracts, of which 37 killed the newly excysted cysticercoids within an hour, when incubated in a culture medium. Lethal concentrations varied from 0.8 to 103 mg/ml. All plant extracts showed activity against the tapeworms after 24 h. Ten of the best extracts were also tested against schistosomules. Five of these extracts showed activity. Lethal concentrations varied from 0.6 to 33.8 mg/ml of dry plant material. Extracts of stem and root from Abrus precatorius (Fabaceae), of root bark and leaves from Ozoroa insignis (Anacardiaceae) and of root bark from Zizyphus mucronata (Rhamnaceae) gave the best results against tapeworms. The best results against schistosomules were obtained with stem and root extracts from Abrus precatorius (Fabaceae) and stem bark from Elephantorrhiza goetzei (Mimosaceae). Although the activity of root and root bark extracts commonly used in traditional medicine was verified in this study, our results showed that also extracts from leaf and stem can be effective anthelmintics.	hymenolepis diminuta trematode schistosoma mansoni
1	Pharmacognostic and phytochemical studies of Zanthoxylum armatum DC.The pharmacognostic and phytochemical investigations on the leaf, stem bark, and fruit of Zanthoxylum armatum were carried out. Macroscopic study of leaf, stem bark, and fruit of Z. armatum revealed some of the characteristic features like size, shape, color, odor and taste of the crude drug. Distinguishing fragments were identified from the powder drug. Leaf, bark, and fruit powder of this plant have higher values of total, acid insoluble, and water soluble ash as compared to the powder of this plant exhausted with ethanol and n- hexane. Extraction values in methanol were highest for leaves (20.10%) and fruit (11%), while bark showed highest value in chloroform (8.5%). The extractive values varied among other parts with different solvents. Fluorescence analysis of the Z. Armatum leaf, stem bark, and fruit powder with various reagents showed characteristic coloration at day and under UV light. Quantitative phytochemical screening revealed the presence of many bioactive constituents in leaves, such as alkaloids (15.60+-0.10 mg/g), sterols (71.60+-0.10mg/g), saponins (21.57+-0.12mg/g), tannins (34.43+-0.21mg/g), phenols (11.66+-0.33mg/g) and flavonoids (13.68+-0.66mg/g). Alkaloids (19.60+-0.10mg/g), sterols (33.83+-0.29mg/g), saponins (14.78+-0.10mg/g), tannins (28.62+-0.13mg/g), phenols (16.48+-1.33mg/g) and flavonoids (18.33+-1.22mg/g) were reported form the bark, while fruits were reported to have alkaloids (25.07+-0.21mg/g), sterols (164.92+-0.14mg/g), saponins (28.60+-0.10mg/g), tannins (35.5+-0.5mg/g), phenols (21.68+-0.44mg/g) and flavonoids (22.8+-1.33mg/g). Z. armatum is an important medicinal plant, traditionally used for various ailments. This study will be helpful in the future pharmacognostic standardization of this important plant.	z. armatum alkaloids
1	High-performance liquid chromatography--two wavelength detection of triterpenoid acids from the fruits of Ziziphus jujuba containing various cultivars in different regions and classification using chemometric analysis.A simple and sensitive HPLC-DAD method has been developed for the first time to simultaneously determine 10 triterpenoid acids (ceanothic acid, alphitolic acid, zizyberanal acid, zizyberanalic acid, epiceanothic acid, ceanothenic acid, betulinic acid, oleanolic acid, ursonic acid and zizyberenalic acid) in the dried fruit of Ziziphus jujuba (called Dazao) which has been widely used as one of the traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs). This HPLC assay was performed on a reversed-phase C(18) column (250 mm x 4.6mm, 5 microm) with the column temperature at 35 degrees C. The mobile phase was composed of A (acetonitrile) and B (0.05% aqueous phosphoric acid, v/v). The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min and the detection wave length was set at 205 nm for reference compounds 1-9 and 238 nm for reference compound 10. All calibration curves showed good linear regression (r(2)&gt;0.9999) within the test range. The established method showed good precision and accuracy with overall intra-day and inter-day variations of 0.43-1.72% and 0.53-2.45%, respectively, and overall recoveries of 94.98-104.09% for the 10 compounds analyzed. The validated method was successfully applied for the simultaneous determination of the 10 triterpenoid acids in 42 batches of Dazao which contained 36 cultivars from 22 cultivation regions, and were investigated and authenticated as Z. jujuba. Hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) and principal components analysis (PCA) were performed to differentiate and classify the samples based on the contents of the 10 triterpenoid acids. The presented HPLC-DAD method conjugated with chemometrics approach was demonstrated to be very helpful in using Dazao resources, and was possibly useful in chemotaxonomic characterization.	z. jujuba betulinic acid
1	Pharmacognostical and phytochemical evaluation of the leaves of Ziziphus xylopyrus (Retz) Willd.BACKGROUND: The fruit decoction of Ziziphus xylopyrus (Retz) Willd. is used toward increase sterility in woman intended birth control in some parts of Rajasthan, India. This plant is widely used in Turkish medicines as a potent sedative. One to two inches of the fresh stem bark of this species are chewed with 1-2 peppers, and the sap swallowed once a day for 5 days in the treatment of cough. Standardization is one of the challenges in herbal medicine. It is essential to evaluate the herbal plants scientifically and proper documentation should be made to know their medicinal properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Leaf samples of Z. xylopyrus were studied as recommended by World Health Organization for morphological, microscopic, physicochemical, phytochemical, powder characteristics and other methods for standardization. RESULTS: Morphologically the leaves are obovate or orbicular in shape, pinnate venation having aromatic odour and pungent taste. Microscopically leaves showed the presence of ground tissue, vascular strand, xylem and phloem. The crystals are mostly rosette type. Microscopic examination of powder showed the presence of stomata, covering trichomes, sclerenchyma, collenchyma, epidermal cells and vascular strands. Phytochemical screening of the plant part with various solvents revealed the presence of alkaloids, carbohydrates, steroids and sterol, glycosides, saponins, flavonoids, phenolic compounds, triterpenoids in it. Physicochemical parameters such as ash value extractive values were also determined and results showed that water soluble extractive value to be higher than alcohol soluble extractive value. CONCLUSION: Results may be helpful for further confirmation of selected species and in future these characters may be compared with the new batch of the same plant materials.	ziziphus xylopyrus flavonoids
2	Cinnamomum cassia Presl: A Review of Its Traditional Uses, Phytochemistry, Pharmacology and Toxicology.Cinnamomum cassia Presl is a tropical aromatic evergreen tree of the Lauraceae family, commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine. It is also a traditional spice, widely used around the world. This paper summarizes the achievements of modern research on C. cassia, including the traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacology and toxicology. In addition, this review also discusses some significant issues and the potential direction of future C. cassia research. More than 160 chemicals have been separated and identified from C. cassia. The main constituents of C. cassia are terpenoids, phenylpropanoids, glycosides, etc. Modern studies have confirmed that C. cassia has a wide range of pharmacological effects, including antitumour, anti-inflammatory and analgesic, anti-diabetic and anti-obesity, antibacterial and antiviral, cardiovascular protective, cytoprotective, neuroprotective, immunoregulatory effects, anti-tyrosinase activity and other effects. However, the modern studies of C. cassia are still not complete and more in-depth investigations need to be conducted in alimentotherapy, health product, toxicity and side effects, and more bioactive components and potential pharmacological effects need to be explored in the future.	c. cassia toxicity
3	In vitro antioxidant activities and anti-proliferative properties of the functional herb Abrus cantoniensis and its main alkaloid abrine.Abrus cantoniensis is a common and popular vegetative food consumed as beverage, soup and folk medicine in the tropical and subtropical areas of Asia. It has been claimed valuable for cleansing toxicants in the liver. However, the functional effects of A. cantoniensis have not yet been scientifically explored. This study comprehensively evaluated the in vitro antioxidant and anti-proliferative capacities of the herbal extract and the main alkaloid abrine. Abrine was qualitatively and quantitatively determined in methanol extract (ME) using HPLC-DAD and LC-MS/MS. The results showed that ME, ethyl acetate fraction (EF) and abrine exhibited comparable ABTS radical cation scavenging activities and reducing power to two commercial antioxidants (BHT and Trolox). The EF exerted strong cellular antioxidant activity and selective cytotoxicity against three cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Biological assays revealed that the EF induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M and apoptosis in MCF-7 and Hep3B cells after 48 h of treatment. Thus, A. cantoniensis exerted potent cellular antioxidant and anti-proliferative properties, highlighting why it has been traditionally used as a functional food. 	abrine cytotoxicity
1	Cinnamomum cassia essential oil inhibits alpha-MSH-induced melanin production and oxidative stress in murine B16 melanoma cells.Essential oils extracted from aromatic plants exhibit important biological activities and have become increasingly important for the development of aromatherapy for complementary and alternative medicine. The essential oil extracted from Cinnamomum cassia Presl (CC-EO) has various functional properties; however, little information is available regarding its anti-tyrosinase and anti-melanogenic activities. In this study, 16 compounds in the CC-EO have been identified; the major components of this oil are cis-2-methoxycinnamic acid (43.06%) and cinnamaldehyde (42.37%). CC-EO and cinnamaldehyde exhibited anti-tyrosinase activities; however, cis-2-methoxycinnamic acid did not demonstrate tyrosinase inhibitory activity. In murine B16 melanoma cells stimulated with alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), CC-EO and cinnamaldehyde not only reduced the melanin content and tyrosinase activity of the cells but also down-regulated tyrosinase expression without exhibiting cytotoxicity. Moreover, CC-EO and cinnamaldehyde decreased thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS) levels and restored glutathione (GSH) and catalase activity in the alpha-MSH-stimulated B16 cells. These results demonstrate that CC-EO and its major component, cinnamaldehyde, possess potent anti-tyrosinase and anti-melanogenic activities that are coupled with antioxidant properties. Therefore, CC-EO may be a good source of skin-whitening agents and may have potential as an antioxidant in the future development of complementary and alternative medicine-based aromatherapy.	cinnamomum cassia cinnamaldehyde
2	In Vitro Evaluations of Cytotoxicity of Eight Antidiabetic Medicinal Plants and Their Effect on GLUT4 Translocation.Despite the enormous achievements in conventional medicine, herbal-based medicines are still a common practice for the treatment of diabetes. Trigonella foenum-graecum, Atriplex halimus, Olea europaea, Urtica dioica, Allium sativum, Allium cepa, Nigella sativa, and Cinnamomum cassia are strongly recommended in the Greco-Arab and Islamic medicine for the treatment and prevention of diabetes. Cytotoxicity (MTT and LDH assays) of the plant extracts was assessed using cells from the liver hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2) and cells from the rat L6 muscle cell line. The effects of the plant extracts (50% ethanol in water) on glucose transporter-4 (GLUT4) translocation to the plasma membrane was tested in an ELISA test on L6-GLUT4myc cells. Results obtained indicate that Cinnamomon cassia is cytotoxic at concentrations higher than 100  mu g/mL, whereas all other tested extracts exhibited cytotoxic effects at concentrations higher than 500  mu g/mL. Exposing L6-GLUT4myc muscle cell to extracts from Trigonella foenum-graecum, Urtica dioica, Atriplex halimus, and Cinnamomum verum led to a significant gain in GLUT4 on their plasma membranes at noncytotoxic concentrations as measured with MTT assay and the LDH leakage assay. These findings indicate that the observed anti-diabetic properties of these plants are mediated, at least partially, through regulating GLUT4 translocation.	cinnamomum verum diabetic
2	An Arrow Poison (Abrus Precatorius) Causing Fatal Poisoning in a Child.Ingestion of whole seeds of Abrus precatorius often does not produce serious illness. It generally presents initially with gastrointestinal manifestations. Haemolysis, acute renal damage, hepatotoxicity and seizures are the other manifestations. Herewith we report a child with accidental ingestion of abrus precatorius seeds who presented with altered sensorium and convulsions. The case is being reported on account of its rarity in its initial neurological manifestation and has not been reported earlier in paediatric age group. 	abrus precatorius hepatotoxicity
1	Crystal structure of abrin-a at 2.14 A.The crystal structure of abrin-a, a type II ribosome-inactivating protein from the seeds of Abrus precatorius, has been determined from a novel crystalline form by the molecular replacement method using the coordinates of ricin. The structure has been refined at 2.14 A to a R-factor of 18.9%. The root-mean-square deviations of bond lengths and angles from the standard values are 0.013 A and 1.82 degrees, respectively. The overall protein folding is similar to that of ricin, but there are differences in the secondary structure, mostly of the A-chain. Several parts of the molecular surface differ significantly; some of them are quite near the active site cleft, and probably influence ribosome recognition. The positions of invariant active site residues remain the same, except the position of Tyr74. Two water molecules of hydrogen-bonded active site residues have been located in the active site cleft. Both of them may be responsible for hydrolyzing the N-C glycosidic bond. The current abrin-a structure is lactose free; this is probably essential for abrin-a crystallization. The B-chain is a glycoprotein, and the positions of several sugar residues of two sugar chains linked to earlier predicted glycosylation sites were determined. One of the sugar chains is a bridge between two neighboring molecules, since one of its mannose residues is connected to the galactose binding site of the neighboring molecule. Another sugar chain covers the surface of the B-chain.	abrus precatorius sugar
1	Dihydrobenzo[c]phenanthridine alkaloids from stem bark of Zanthoxylum nitidum.Five novel alkaloids, zanthomuurolanine ( 1), epi-zanthomuurolanine ( 2), zanthocadinanines A ( 3) and B ( 4), and epi-zanthocadinanine B ( 5), composed of dihydrochelerythrine and a cadinane-type sesquiterpene linked by a methylene bridge, have been isolated from stem bark of Zanthoxylum nitidum. These structures were elucidated by spectroscopic techniques (UV, IR, MS, CD, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, DEPT, COSY, NOESY, HSQC, and HMBC analyses). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies confirmed the relative configurations of 1 and 4 and provided additional support for the structures of 2, 3, and 5.	zanthoxylum nitidum dihydrochelerythrine
1	In vitro activities of plant extracts on human Loa loa isolates and cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells.Loa loa, a filarial worm, can cause fatal encephalitis in humans. In an attempt to find alternatives to the standard treatments (ivermectin and diethylcarbamazine citrate), we tested 12 methanolic extracts of nine traditional plant remedies. The extracts (100-0.09 microg/ml) were incubated with 20 Loa loa microfilariae isolated from patients at 37 degrees C with 5% CO(2) in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal serum and antibiotics. Activity was evaluated 120 h later by counting live microfilariae under a microscope. Cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells was estimated by measuring 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2-5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide transformation to formazan at 450 nM in a spectrophotometer. The plants tested were Lophira alata, Greenwayodendron suaveolens, Uapaca togoensis, Zanthoxylum heitzii, Peperomia pellucida, Piptadeniastrum africanum, Petersianthus macrocarpus, Vernonia conferta, and Vernonia hymenolepis. Chemical screening showed that most of the extracts contained reducing sugars, tannin or polyphenols, sterols or triterpenes, saponosides, and alkaloids. None contained carotinoids and few contained flavonoids. The 50% lethal concentration ranged from 0.22 to 70.28 microg/ml, while the 50% inhibitory concentration for eukaryotic cells (IC(50)) ranged from 8.52 to 119.52 microg/ml. Extracts of P. macrocarpus (selectivity index = 72.16), P. africanum (13.69), Z. heitzii (12.11), and L. alata (9.26) were highly selective for L. loa.	l. alata sterols
3	Hepatoprotective standardized EtOH-water extract of the leaves of Ziziphus jujuba.The hepatoprotective activity of the EtOH-water extract of Ziziphus jujuba leaves was evaluated against CCl4-induced hepatic damage in mice. The EtOH-water extract significantly alleviated liver damage as indicated by the decreased levels of serum ALT and AST and the decreased MDA content, the increased levels of SOD, GSH and GSH-Px, and the reduced pathological tissue injury induced by CCl4. A quantitative analysis of fifteen major constituents (1-15) of the EtOH-water extract of the leaves of Z. jujuba was conducted by HPLC-DAD. Based on our research results, it can be concluded that the EtOH-water extract of the leaves of Z. jujuba is efficacious for prevention and treatment of CCl4-induced hepatic injury in mice. Flavonoids might be the active ingredients responsible for the biological and pharmacological activities towards hepatoprotection.	Flavonoids hepatic injury
1	Fumigant toxicity of cassia and cinnamon oils and cinnamaldehyde and structurally related compounds to Dermanyssus gallinae (Acari: Dermanyssidae).The toxicity of two cassia oils, four cinnamon oils and (E)-cinnamaldehyde and (E)-cinnamic acid and 34 structurally related compounds to adult Dermanyssus gallinae (De Geer) collected from a poultry house was examined using a vapour-phase mortality bioassay. Results were compared with those of dichlorvos, a conventional acaricide. The cassia and cinnamon oils (cinnamon technical, cinnamon #500, cassia especial, cassia true, cinnamon bark and cinnamon green leaf) exhibited good fumigant toxicity (LD(50), 11.79-26.40 mug cm(-3)). alpha-Methyl-(E)-cinnamaldehyde (LD(50), 0.45 mug cm(-3)) and (E)-cinnamaldehyde (0.54 mug cm(-3)) were the most toxic compounds and the toxicity of these compounds was comparable to that of dichlorvos (0.30 mug cm(-3)). Potent fumigant toxicity was also observed in allyl cinnamate, ethyl-alpha-cyanocinnamate, (E)-2-methoxylcinnamic acid and (Z)-2-methoxylcinnamic acid (LD(50), 0.81-0.92 mug cm(-3)). Structure-activity relationships indicate that structural characteristics, such as types of functional groups and carbon skeleton rather than vapour pressure parameter, appear to play a role in determining toxicity. The essential oils and compounds described merit further study as potential acaricides for the control of D. gallinae populations as fumigants with contact action due to global efforts to reduce the level of highly toxic synthetic acaricides in the agricultural environment.	cinnamon (e)-2-methoxylcinnamic acid
2	Traditional medicine practices among community members with chronic kidney disease in northern Tanzania: an ethnomedical survey.BACKGROUND: In sub-Saharan Africa, chronic kidney disease (CKD) is being recognized as a non-communicable disease (NCD) with high morbidity and mortality. In countries like Tanzania, people access many sources, including traditional medicines, to meet their healthcare needs for NCDs, but little is known about traditional medicine practices among people with CKD. Therefore, we sought to characterize these practices among community members with CKD in northern Tanzania. METHODS: Between December 2013 and June 2014, we administered a previously-developed survey to a random sample of adult community-members from the Kilimanjaro Region; the survey was designed to measure traditional medicine practices such as types, frequencies, reasons, and modes. Participants were also tested for CKD, diabetes, hypertension, and HIV as part of the CKD-AFRiKA study. To identify traditional medicines used in the local treatment of kidney disease, we reviewed the qualitative sessions which had previously been conducted with key informants. RESULTS: We enrolled 481 adults of whom 57 (11.9 %) had CKD. The prevalence of traditional medicine use among adults with CKD was 70.3 % (95 % CI 50.0-84.9 %), and among those at risk for CKD (n = 147; 30.6 %), it was 49.0 % (95 % CI 33.1-65.0 %). Among adults with CKD, the prevalence of concurrent use of traditional medicine and biomedicine was 33.2 % (11.4-65.6 %). Symptomatic ailments (66.7 %; 95 % CI 17.3-54.3), malaria/febrile illnesses (64.0 %; 95 % CI 44.1-79.9), and chronic diseases (49.6 %; 95 % CI 28.6-70.6) were the most prevalent uses for traditional medicines. We identified five plant-based traditional medicines used for the treatment of kidney disease: Aloe vera, Commifora africana, Cymbopogon citrullus, Persea americana, and Zanthoxylum chalybeum. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of traditional medicine use is high among adults with and at risk for CKD in northern Tanzania where they use them for a variety of conditions including other NCDs. Additionally, many of these same people access biomedicine and traditional medicines concurrently. The traditional medicines used for the local treatment of kidney disease have a variety of activities, and people with CKD may be particularly vulnerable to adverse effects. Recognizing these traditional medicine practices will be important in shaping CKD treatment programs and public health policies aimed at addressing CKD.	aloe vera kidney disease
1	Measurement of plasma procyanidin B-2 and procyanidin B-3 levels after oral administration in rat.Using a high-performance liquid chromatographic method and mass spectrometry analysis, we successfully measured the absorption of orally administered procyanidin B-2 and procyanidin B-3 isolated from Cinnamonomi cortex (the bark of Cinnamomum cassia Blume) in the rat plasma. This method used a TSK- GEL ODS-80TS column, two solvents (A: 0.01% acetic acid; B: methanol with 0.01% acetic acid) in a linear gradient at a flow-rate of 1.0 ml/min, and fluorescence detection at excitation and emission wavelengths of 220 and 327 nm.	cinnamomum cassia procyanidin b-3
2	Antiproliferative and anticarcinogenic effects of an aqueous preparation of Abies alba and Viscum album se abies, on a L-1210 malignant cell line and tumor-bearing Wistar rats.Extracts of plants have been widely tested for possible anticarcinogenic properties. In the present study a traditional remedy, consisting of an aqueous extract of mixed parts of the tree Abies alba and its mistletoe Viscum album se abies was tested on benzo(alpha)pyrene(BaP)-induced tumors in Wistar rats and on the L-1210 malignant cell line. Two main groups of male Wistar rats subcutaneously injected by 10 mg of BaP, a dose inducing 100% carcinogenesis, a control group (C-G, 15 rats) and a treatment group(TR-G, 18 rats), were used for the study. Five animals bearing BaP-induced tumors were also tested (TR-1-G). Animals of the TR-G were orally administered with the aqueous extract at doses of 50 ml/kg b.w, from the day of BaP injection and of the TR-1-G, from the 120th day of injection, till death. L-1210 malignant cells in cultivation, were administered with a powder obtained by condensation and lyophilization of the extract, at various concentrations and cytotoxicity was measured by the microculture tetrazolium assay. Autopsy of the rats, revealed metastasis in the lungs of the animals of all groups and the tumors developed were histologically identified as leiomyosarcomas. The results indicated that the extract of the above plants possess anticarcinogenic effects, documented by: a) its antiproliferative effects on L-1210 cells (IC50 = 49.6 +/- 1.4 micrograms/ml), b) the significant prolongation of life and reduction of tumor growth rate of the animals of the TR-G in comparison to the C-G, c) the inhibition by 16.6% of tumor induction in the TR-G and d) the prolongation of life and the necrotic effects of the extract on the tumors of the animals in the TR-1-G. The antiproliferative effects of the Abies alba and Viscum album se abies extract may be due to the lectins and thionins contained in Viscum album, as well as to the monoterpenes contained in Abies alba. Soft tissue tumors sensitive to the extract, are widespread among human organs, even in larynx, and are usually resistant to chemotherapy.	abies alba tumors
1	Quantitative and pattern recognition analyses of magnoflorine, spinosin, 6'''-feruloyl spinosin and jujuboside A by HPLC in Zizyphi Semen.Two rapid and simple HPLC methods with UV detector to determine three main compounds (magnoflorine, spinosin and 6'''-feruloyl spinosin) and evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD) to determine jujuboside A were developed for the chemical analyses of Zizyphi Semen. Magnoflorine, spinosin, and 6'''-feruloyl spinosin were separated with an YMC J'sphere ODS-H80 column (250 mm x 4.6 mm, 4 mum) by the gradient elution followed by the isocratic elution using methanol with 0.1 % formic acid and water with 0.1 % formic acid as the mobile phase. The flow rate was 1.0 mL/min. Jujuboside A was separated by HPLC-ELSD with YoungJinBioChrom Aegispak C18-L column (250 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 mum) column in a gradient elution using methanol with 0.1 % formic acid (A) and water with 0.1 % formic acid as the mobile phase. These two methods were fully validated with respect to linearity, precision, accuracy, stability, and robustness. These HPLC methods were applied successfully to quantify four compounds in a Zizyphi Semen extract. The HPLC analytical methods were validated for pattern recognition analysis by repeated analysis of 91 seed samples corresponding to 48 Zizyphus jujuba var. spinosa (J01-J48) and 43 Zizyphus mauritiana (M01-M43). The results indicate that these methods are suitable for a quality evaluation of Zizyphi Semen.	zizyphus jujuba var jujuboside a
1	Cytotoxicity and enhancement activity of essential oil from Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim. as a natural transdermal penetration enhancer.The aim of this present study is to investigate the effect of Zanthoxylum bungeanum oil (essential oil from Z. bungeanum Maxim.) on cytotoxicity and the transdermal permeation of 5-fluorouracil and indomethacin. The cytotoxicity of Z. bungeanum oil on dermal fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes was studied using an MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. The rat skin was employed to determine the percutaneous penetration enhancement effect of Z. bungeanum oil on hydrophilic and lipophilic model drugs, i.e., 5-fluorouracil and indomethacin. The secondary structure changes of the rat stratum corneum (SC) were determined using attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), and saturated solubilities and SC/vehicle partition coefficients of two model drugs with and without Z. bungeanum oil were also measured to understand its related mechanisms of action. It was found that the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of Z. bungeanum oil were significantly lower in HaCaT and CCC-ESF-1 cell lines compared to the well-established and standard penetration enhancer Azone. The Z. bungeanum oil at various concentrations effectively facilitated the percutaneous penetration of two model drugs across the rat skin. In addition, the mechanisms of permeation enhancement by Z. bungeanum oil could be explained with saturated solubility, SC/vehicle partition coefficient, and secondary structure changes of SC. 	z. bungeanum bungeanum oil
1	Phytochemical analyses of Ziziphus jujuba Mill. var. spinosa seed by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.Ziziphus jujuba Mill. var. spinosa (Z. jujuba) seeds have attracted much attention within the field of medicine due to their significant effects against disturbances of the central nervous system. Secondary metabolites composition is key to the influence of the pharmaceutical and commercial qualities of this plant. In this work, the phytochemical profile of Z. jujuba seeds was analysed by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The UPLC-MS/MS information identified the main secondary metabolites in Z. jujuba seeds, including flavonoid C-glycosides, triterpene acids and unsaturated fatty acids. The leading chemical identified by UPLC-MS/MS was betulinic acid, and oleic acid was the leading volatile from the GC-MS results. All the samples tested showed similar phytochemical profiles, but levels of the chemical compounds varied. Principal component analysis revealed the principal secondary metabolites that could define the differences in quality. It was confirmed that the combination of UPLC-MS/MS and GC-MS was an effective technique to demonstrate the pharmaceutical quality of Z. jujuba seeds. 	z. jujuba triterpene acids
2	Nephroprotective properties of the methanol stem extract of Abrus precatorius on gentamicin-induced renal damage in rats.Background The use of plants for the treatment and prevention of diseases in man and his animals has led to a renewed scientific interest in the use of medicinal plants for therapeutic purposes. The nephroprotective properties of methanol stem bark extract of Abrus precatorius against gentamicin-induced renal damage in rats was evaluated in this study. Methods Thirty male Wistar rats were divided into five equal groups. Group A was the negative control group while B was the positive control group which received gentamicin 100 mg/kg intra-peritoneally for 6 days. Group C were pretreated with 100 mg/kg extract for the 3 days and then concurrently with gentamicin 100 mg/kg for 3 days and group D were pretreated with 200 mg/kg extract for 3 days and then concurrently with gentamicin 100 mg/kg for 3 days. Group E received gentamicin intraperitoneally for 6 days followed by administration of 200 mg/kg of the extract for 3 days. Blood samples, kidneys and kidney homogenates were collected for haematological, biochemical, histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis. Results The results showed that no significant haematological changes were noted. The groups treated with extract exhibited significant increase in body weight gain. While group B significantly exhibited focal areas of inflammation, fatty degeneration, congestion of vessels, tubular necrosis and glomerular atrophy, the lesions were mild with the treated groups. Treated groups exhibited a dose dependent significant decrease in serum creatinine, urea, XO, NO and Myeloperoxidase, AOPP, Protein carbonyl, H2O2 generated and MDA levels when compared with group B. There were significant dose dependent improvements in SOD, GST, GSH, Protein thiol, and non-protein thiol levels in the treated groups when compared with group B. In immunohistochemistry, Group B exhibited over expression of CRP and NF-kappaB levels, and marked reduction in expression of Bcl-2 while the reverse was seen in the groups treated with methanol extracts of Abrus precatorius. Conclusion The methanol extract of Abrus precatorius plays a vital role against gentamicin induced renal damage by reducing levels of renal markers of oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis, enhancing enzymatic and non enzymatic renal antioxidant system, alongside an increase in Bcl-2 and a decrease in NF-kappaB and CRP expressions.	abrus precatorius inflammation
1	Identification of the potential active components of Abelmoschus manihot in rat blood and kidney tissue by microdialysis combined with ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry.In this paper, microdialysis combining with ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) was applied to simultaneously identify components in blood and kidney dialysis after oral administration of Abelmoschus manihot extract. Microdialysis probe was implanted in the jugular vein and the kidney medulla, respectively; microdialysis samples were collected continuously, transferred to microtubes and analyzed by UPLC-Q-TOF/MS. The components in microdialysis samples were separated by an UPLC HSS T3 column and eluted with acetonitrile and water (containing 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The results showed that unbound constituents in blood circulation of the rat include hyperoside, isoquercitrin, quercetin monoglucuronide, quercetin-3'-O-glucoside, quercetin, myricetin, and hibifolin while unbound constituents in kidney are hyperoside, isoquercitrin, quercetin monoglucuronide, which might be the potential active components in vivo. The developed method was simple and reliable, and could be adopted to rapidly screen and identify potential active components contributing to pharmacological effects of TCM and to better clarify its action mechanism.	abelmoschus manihot isoquercitrin
3	Essential Oils, Silver Nanoparticles and Propolis as Alternative Agents Against Fluconazole Resistant Candida albicans, Candida glabrata and Candida krusei Clinical Isolates.Development of effective and safe therapeutic treatment of fungal infections remains one of the major challenge for modern medicine. The aim of presented investigation was to analyze the in vitro antifungal activity of selected essential oils, ethanolic extracts of propolis and silver nanoparticles dropped on TiO2 against azole-resistant C. albicans (n = 20), C. glabrata (n = 14) and C. krusei (n = 10) clinical isolates. Among tested essential oils, the highest activity has definitely been found in the case of the oil isolated from the bark of Cinnamomum cassia, with MIC and MFC values for all tested strains in the range of 0.0006-0.0097 % (v/v) and 0.0012-0.019 % (v/v), respectively. High activity was also observed for the Lemon, Basil, Thyme, Geranium and Clove (from buds) essential oils. Significant differences in fungicidal activity have been observed in the case of four tested propolis samples. Only one of them revealed high activity, with MFC values in the range from 0.156 to 1.25 % (v/v). Satisfactory fungicidal activity, against C. albicans and C. glabrata isolates, was also observed in the case of silver nanoparticles, however C. krusei isolates were mostly resistant. We also revealed that constituents of most of essential oils and propolis as well as silver nanoparticles are not substrates for drug transporters, which belong to the most important factors affecting resistance of Candida spp. clinical isolates to many of conventional antimycotics. To conclude, the results of our investigation revealed that essential oils, propolis and silver nanoparticles represent high potential for controlling and prevention candidiasis. 	essential oils candidiasis
1	In vitro activities of plant extracts on human Loa loa isolates and cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells.Loa loa, a filarial worm, can cause fatal encephalitis in humans. In an attempt to find alternatives to the standard treatments (ivermectin and diethylcarbamazine citrate), we tested 12 methanolic extracts of nine traditional plant remedies. The extracts (100-0.09 microg/ml) were incubated with 20 Loa loa microfilariae isolated from patients at 37 degrees C with 5% CO(2) in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal serum and antibiotics. Activity was evaluated 120 h later by counting live microfilariae under a microscope. Cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells was estimated by measuring 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2-5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide transformation to formazan at 450 nM in a spectrophotometer. The plants tested were Lophira alata, Greenwayodendron suaveolens, Uapaca togoensis, Zanthoxylum heitzii, Peperomia pellucida, Piptadeniastrum africanum, Petersianthus macrocarpus, Vernonia conferta, and Vernonia hymenolepis. Chemical screening showed that most of the extracts contained reducing sugars, tannin or polyphenols, sterols or triterpenes, saponosides, and alkaloids. None contained carotinoids and few contained flavonoids. The 50% lethal concentration ranged from 0.22 to 70.28 microg/ml, while the 50% inhibitory concentration for eukaryotic cells (IC(50)) ranged from 8.52 to 119.52 microg/ml. Extracts of P. macrocarpus (selectivity index = 72.16), P. africanum (13.69), Z. heitzii (12.11), and L. alata (9.26) were highly selective for L. loa.	p. africanum polyphenols
1	Components and insecticidal activity against the maize weevils of Zanthoxylum schinifolium fruits and leaves.In our screening program for new agrochemicals from Chinese medicinal herbs and wild plants, Zanthoxylum schinifolium essential oils were found to possess strong insecticidal activity against the maize weevil Sitophilus zeamais. The essential oils of Z. schinifolium fruits and leaves were extracted via hydrodistillation and investigated by GC and GC-MS. Estragole (69.52%) was the major compound of the essential oil of fresh fruits, followed by linalool (8.63%) and limonene (4.34%) and 94.33% of the total components were monoterpenoids. The main components of the essential oil of fresh leaves were linalool (12.94%), ar-tumerone (8.95%), limonene (6.45%) and elixene (5.43%) and only 50.62% were monoterpenoids. However, the essential oil from purchased fruits contained linalool (33.42%), limonene (13.66%) and sabinene (5.72%), followed by estragole (4.67%), nerol (4.56%) and 4-terpineol (4.27%). Estragole, linalool and sabinene were separated and purified by silica gel column chromatography and preparative thin layer chromatography, and further identified by means of physicochemical and spectrometric analysis. The essential oil from the fresh fruits (LD50 = 15.93 mug/adult) possessed two times more toxicity to the insects compared with that of fresh leaves (LD50 = 35.31 mug/adult). Estragole, linalool and sabinene exhibited contact activity against S. zeamais with LD50 values of 17.63, 13.90 and 23.98 mug/adult, respectively. The essential oils of Z. schinifolium possessed strong fumigant toxicity against S. zeamais adults with LC50 values of 13.19 mg/L (fresh fruits), 24.04 mg/L (fresh leaves) and 17.63 mg/L (purchased fruits). Estragole, linalool and sabinene also exhibited strong fumigant toxicity against the maize weevils with LC50 values of 14.10, 10.46 and 9.12 mg/L, respectively.	maize weevils monoterpenoids
1	Bioactive A-type proanthocyanidins from Cinnamomum cassia.Two trimeric proanthocyanidins, cinnamtannin B-1 (1) and cinnamtannin D-1 (2), have been isolated from the bark of Cinnamomum cassia along with the known tetramer parameritannin A-1 (3) and a previously unreported tetramer, named cassiatannin A (4). The structures of 1-4 were elucidated on the basis of 1D and 2D NMR, MS, and CD analyses and compared to the reported data. Proanthocyanidins (1-4) possess significant in vitro inhibitory activity against cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) at micromolar concentrations.	cinnamomum cassia Proanthocyanidins
1	Efficient Approach for the Extraction and Identification of Red Pigment from Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim and Its Antioxidant Activity.Red pigment (RP) was extracted from the peels of Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim (PZB) by ultrasonic-assisted extraction (UAE) in this work. Box-Behnken design-response surface methodology (BBD-RSM) was employed to research the efficiency of the RP extraction. Based on the optimization of RSM, results showed that the optimal extraction conditions were as follows: liquid-solid ratio of 31 mL/g, extraction time of 41 min, and extraction temperature of 27  C, and under these conditions, the actual absorbance value was 0.615 +- 0.13%, highly agreeing with the predicted value by the model. Furthermore, ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) was used to separate and analyze RP. The compounds of RP were mainly flavonoids, and there were five compounds detected for the first time in PZB. In addition, RP showed significant antioxidant activities in vitro, which could be developed for anti-aging candidate drugs and functional foods. In conclusion, ultrasound-assisted extraction with BBD-RSM and chromatographic separation technology with UPLC-MS are efficient strategies for the isolation and identification of RP from PZB.	zanthoxylum bungeanum maxim flavonoids
1	Safety assessment of Zanthoxylum alatum Roxb. essential oil, its antifungal, antiaflatoxin, antioxidant activity and efficacy as antimicrobial in preservation of Piper nigrum L. fruits.The investigation deals with antifungal, antiaflatoxin and antioxidant efficacy of Zanthoxylum alatum Roxb. essential oil (EO), its two major constituents and their comparison with five commonly used organic acid preservatives. The chemical profile of EO, characterized through GC and GC-MS analysis, revealed linalool (56.10%) and methyl cinnamate (19.73%) as major components. The EO, linalool and methyl cinnamate completely inhibited the growth of a toxigenic strain of A. flavus (LHP-10) as well as aflatoxin B(1) secretion at different concentrations. Methyl cinnamate was found to be more efficacious than EO, linalool and five organic acid preservatives, showing antifungal and antiaflatoxigenic efficacy at a low concentration (0.6 mul/ml) and the nature of its toxicity was fungicidal. However, EO showed strong antioxidant activity with an IC(50) value at 5.6 mul/ml. Moreover, EO was found to have negligible mammalian toxicity as its LD(50) value, determined through oral administration on mice, was calculated to be 6124mul/kg body weight during safety profile assessment. During in vivo investigation on fruit systems, the Zanthoxylum EO, when tested as fumigant, provided 66.27% and 86.33% protection respectively at 1.25 mul/ml and 2.5 mul/ml against fungi infesting Piper nigrum L. fruits demonstrating its practical efficacy as a plant based antimicrobial for post harvest application.	piper nigrum l linalool

1	Characterization of triterpenic acids in fruits of ziziphus species by HPLC-ELSD-MS.The fruits of Ziziphus species have been utilized as food as well as crude drugs for their health benefits in China for thousands of years. This paper reported a reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for the simultaneous characterization and quantitation of 11 triterpenic acids in chloroform extracts of jujube fruits by using an evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD) and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The results showed that the contents of triterpenic acids in the fruits of Ziziphus jujuba var. spinosa were higher than those in the fruits of Z. jujuba, especially for the compound pomonic acid. Differences were also found among the different parts of Z. jujuba var. spinosa fruits with the sarcocarp having a higher amount of triterpenic acids than the seed and hard core.	z. jujuba var triterpenic acids
2	Antifungal constituents of northern prickly ash, Zanthoxylum americanum mill.Leaf, fruit, stem, bark and root of Zanthoxylum americanum were investigated for antifungal activity with 11 strains of fungi representing diverse opportunistic and systemic pathogens, including Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus fumigatus. All extracts demonstrated a broad spectrum of antifungal activity and inhibited at least eight fungal species in a disk diffusion assay (600 microg/disk). Antifungal activity was light-dependent, with fruit and leaf extracts most active in general. The presence of light-mediated compounds, such as psoralen, 8-methoxypsoralen and imperatorin in extracts of different organs was confirmed by RP-HPLC. A high furanocoumarin content was detected in fruit and leaf and low furanocoumarin levels were found in bark and wood. A high positive correlation was observed between total furanocoumarin content and fungal inhibition zones (r2=0.902, p&lt;0.001). The results provide a phytochemical basis for the very widespread use of Z. americanum in indigenous North American ethnomedical tradition for conditions that may be related to fungal infections.	z. americanum fungal infections

3	Cinnamaldehyde induces apoptosis and reverses epithelial-mesenchymal transition through inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in non-small cell lung cancer.Cinnamaldehyde, the main chemical component of the essential oil separated from the traditional herb Cinnamomum cassia, has been demonstrated to be an efficient cytotoxic agent against several human cancers. The present experiment showed that cinnamaldehyde dose-dependently depresses the proliferation of three types of NSCLC cells and induces cell apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, cinnamaldehyde attenuated CoCl2-induced EMT and decreased matrix metalloprotease (MMP) family while the in vivo study showed the same trend. Mechanistically, cinnamaldehyde imitated the suppressive effect of XAV939 on cell motility and EMT which could be impaired by LiCl. Collectively, our research demonstrated for the first time that cinnamaldehyde is able to inhibit NSCLC cell growth by inducing apoptosis and reverse EMT through terminating Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, which might supply further insight into cinnamaldehyde-mediated anti-tumor effect against NSCLC for better prognosis.	cinnamaldehyde NSCLC
4	Development and characterization of immobilized cannabinoid receptor (CB1/CB2) open tubular column for on-line screening.Cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, are therapeutic targets in the treatment of anxiety, obesity, movement disorders, glaucoma, and pain. We have developed an on-line screening method for CB1 and CB2 ligands, where cellular membrane fragments of a chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line, KU-812, were immobilized onto the surface of an open tubular (OT) capillary to create a CB1/CB2-OT column. The binding activities of the immobilized CB1/CB2 receptors were established using frontal affinity chromatographic techniques. This is the first report that confirms the presence of functional CB1 and CB2 receptors on KU-812 cells. The data from this study confirm that the CB1/CB2-OT column can be used to determine the binding affinities (K(i) values) for a single compound and to screen individual compounds or a mixture of multiple compounds. The CB1/CB2-OT column was also used to screen a botanical matrix, Zanthoxylum clava-herculis, where preliminary results suggest the presence of a high-affinity phytocannabinoid.	CB2 glaucoma

Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis. Compounds 2-8 and 11-13 were first isolated from Rutaceae and the others were isolated for the first time from Z. armatum.	z. armatum lignan glycoside
2	Antiproliferative and anticarcinogenic effects of an aqueous preparation of Abies alba and Viscum album se abies, on a L-1210 malignant cell line and tumor-bearing Wistar rats.Extracts of plants have been widely tested for possible anticarcinogenic properties. In the present study a traditional remedy, consisting of an aqueous extract of mixed parts of the tree Abies alba and its mistletoe Viscum album se abies was tested on benzo(alpha)pyrene(BaP)-induced tumors in Wistar rats and on the L-1210 malignant cell line. Two main groups of male Wistar rats subcutaneously injected by 10 mg of BaP, a dose inducing 100% carcinogenesis, a control group (C-G, 15 rats) and a treatment group(TR-G, 18 rats), were used for the study. Five animals bearing BaP-induced tumors were also tested (TR-1-G). Animals of the TR-G were orally administered with the aqueous extract at doses of 50 ml/kg b.w, from the day of BaP injection and of the TR-1-G, from the 120th day of injection, till death. L-1210 malignant cells in cultivation, were administered with a powder obtained by condensation and lyophilization of the extract, at various concentrations and cytotoxicity was measured by the microculture tetrazolium assay. Autopsy of the rats, revealed metastasis in the lungs of the animals of all groups and the tumors developed were histologically identified as leiomyosarcomas. The results indicated that the extract of the above plants possess anticarcinogenic effects, documented by: a) its antiproliferative effects on L-1210 cells (IC50 = 49.6 +/- 1.4 micrograms/ml), b) the significant prolongation of life and reduction of tumor growth rate of the animals of the TR-G in comparison to the C-G, c) the inhibition by 16.6% of tumor induction in the TR-G and d) the prolongation of life and the necrotic effects of the extract on the tumors of the animals in the TR-1-G. The antiproliferative effects of the Abies alba and Viscum album se abies extract may be due to the lectins and thionins contained in Viscum album, as well as to the monoterpenes contained in Abies alba. Soft tissue tumors sensitive to the extract, are widespread among human organs, even in larynx, and are usually resistant to chemotherapy.	abies alba tumors
1	2-undecanone rich leaf essential oil from Zanthoxylum armatum.The leaf essential oils of Zanthoxylum armatum DC (Rutaceae) from Kumaon, India, extracted by hydrodistillation, were analyzed by capillary gas chromatography (GC-FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The major classes of compounds found in the leaf oils were acyclic and menthane monoterpenoids as well as simple alcohols, aldehydes and ketones. The high proportion of non-terpenic acyclic ketones, notably 2-undecanone and 2-tridecanone, and the low abundance of undec-10-en-1-al and p-phellandren-8-ol make the composition entirely new. Other constituents present in significant amounts were oxygenated monoterpenes, which include 1,8-cineole, linalool, terpinen-4-ol, and alpha-terpineol, and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons represented mainly by trans-caryophyllene, a-humulene and germacrene D. On the contrary, the oil distilled from the leaves on the second day of distillation was characterized by a high content of 2-tridecanone (27.1%) and trans-caryophyllene (7.4%), as compared with 3.5% and 4.6%, respectively, for the fresh leaves; a slight decrease in pH of the distillate was also significant. Moreover, the presence of a high 2-undecanone content followed by 2-tridecanone is being reported for the first time for Z. armatum from this region. In terms of molecular diversity, the simple acyclic ketones dominate the essential oils as compared with linalool that was reported in several previous studies on Z. armatum. Therefore, the two acyclic ketones may be utilized to establish the origin and authenticity of the material.	z. armatum ketones
1	Identification of CB1/CB2 ligands from Zanthoxylum bungeanum.In order to study cannabinoid receptor ligands, a novel plate-based assay was developed previously to measure internalization of CB1/CB2 receptors by determining the change in the intracellular levels of the radiolabeled agonists. This plate-based assay was also used for screening against complex matrices, specifically, in the present study screening for CB1/CB2 receptor activity of extracts for several species of the plant genus Zanthoxylum. The objective of this screen was to identify novel antagonists of the CB1 receptor, which simultaneously displayed agonist activity against the CB2 receptor, since compounds matching this criterion could be potential candidates for the treatment of type-1 diabetes. As a result, two Z. bungeanum extracts were deemed active, leading to the identification of eight compounds, of which compound 7 [(2E,4E,8E,10E,12E)-N-isobutyl-2,4,8,10,12-tetradecapentaenamide, gamma-sanshool] was obtained as a promising lead compound. 	z. bungeanum gamma-sanshool
1	Field evaluation of repellency of a polyherbal essential oil against blackflies and its dermal toxicity using rat model.In the present study we have evaluated the repellent activity of mixture of Curcuma longa, Zanthoxylum limonella and Pogostemon heyneanus essential oils in 1:1:2 ratio at 5%, 10% and 20% concentration against blackflies in northeastern India. Initially the essential oil mixture tested here has been found effective against Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The average protection recorded in 20% concentration (170.56 +- 4.0; 95% CI = 162.09-179.02) was higher as compared to other two concentrations (F = 90.2; p&lt;0.0001; df = 53). Percentage repellency and repellency index was found to be higher in 20% concentration (p &lt;= 0.017). No appreciable clinical and behavioral signs were observed in the acute dermal toxicity using rat model. No changes were observed in biochemical profiles of treatment group animals. Similarly, no prominent lesions were observed in vital organs of treatment in both the sexes. The study concludes that tested repellent is safe for use and has multi-insects repellent property.	zanthoxylum limonella essential oil
1	The anti-diabetic effects and pharmacokinetic profiles of berberine in mice treated with Jiao-Tai-Wan and its compatibility.Jiao-Tai-Wan (JTW), a classical Chinese prescription, has been clinically employed to treat diabetes mellitus in recent years. To investigate the comparative evaluations on anti-diabetic effects and pharmacokinetics of the active ingredient berberine in mice treated with JTW in various combinations of its constituent herbs. In our study, the anti-diabetic study was carried out in diabetic mice induced by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. The diabetic mice were randomly assigned to three therapy groups and orally administered with different prescription proportions of Rhizoma Coptidis and Cinnamomum cassia respectively. The level of plasma glucose, lipid profile and parameters related to oxidative stress were determined. The concentrations of berberine in non-diabetic mice plasma were determined using HPLC, and main pharmacokinetic parameters were investigated. The results indicated that the compatibility effects of ingredients present in Cinnamomum cassia could affect the anti-diabetic ability and pharmacokinetics of berberine in JTW. 	cinnamomum cassia berberine
2	Cinnamomum cassia exhibits antileishmanial activity against Leishmania donovani infection in vitro and in vivo.BACKGROUND: There is a pressing need for drug discovery against visceral leishmaniasis, a life-threatening protozoal infection, as the available chemotherapy is antiquated and not bereft of side effects. Plants as alternate drug resources has rewarded mankind in the past and aimed in this direction, we investigated the antileishmanial potential of Cinnamomum cassia. METHODOLOGY: Dichloromethane, ethanolic and aqueous fractions of C. cassia bark, prepared by sequential extraction, were appraised for their anti-promastigote activity along with apoptosis-inducing potential. The most potent, C. cassia dichloromethane fraction (CBD) was evaluated for anti-amastigote efficacy in infected macrophages and nitric oxide (NO) production studied. The in vivo antileishmanial efficacy was assessed in L. donovani infected BALB/c mice and hamsters and various correlates of host protective immunity ascertained. Toxicity profile of CBD was investigated in vitro against peritoneal macrophages and in vivo via alterations in liver and kidney functions. The plant secondary metabolites present in CBD were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: CBD displayed significant anti-promastigote activity with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 33.6 mug ml-1 that was mediated via apoptosis. This was evidenced by mitochondrial membrane depolarization, increased proportion of cells in sub-G0-G1 phase, ROS production, PS externalization and DNA fragmentation (TUNEL assay). CBD also inhibited intracellular amastigote proliferation (IC50 14.06 mug ml-1) independent of NO production. The in vivo protection achieved was 80.91% (liver) and 82.92% (spleen) in mice and 75.61% (liver) and 78.93% (spleen) in hamsters indicating its profound therapeutic efficacy. CBD exhibited direct antileishmanial activity, as it did not specifically induce a T helper type (Th)-1-polarized mileu in cured hosts. This was evidenced by insignificant modulation of NO production, lymphoproliferation, DTH (delayed type hypersensitivity), serum IgG2a and IgG1 levels and production of Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) along with restoration of pro-inflammatory Th1 cytokines (INF-gamma, IL-12p70) to the normal range. CBD was devoid of any toxicity in vitro as well as in vivo. The chemical constituents, cinnamaldehyde and its derivatives present in CBD may have imparted the observed antileishmanial effect. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the profound antileishmanial efficacy of C. cassia bark DCM fraction and merits its further exploration as a source of safe and effective antieishmanial compounds.	c. cassia leishmania donovani infection
1	[GC-MS analysis and cytotoxic activity of the supercritical extracts from roots and stems of Zanthoxylum nitidum].The volatile components of roots and stems of Zanthoxylum nitidum were investigated by supercritical fluid carbon dioxide extraction (SFE-CO2) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry(GC-MS). Thirty-one and fifty-one compounds were identified in the supercritical extracts from roots and stems of Z. nitidum, respectively, and total twenty-seven compounds were the common constituents. Among them, the major constituents in root and stem supercritical extracts were spathulenol (18.49 and 26.18%), n-hexadecanoic acid (14.24% and 12.79%), ar-tumerone (6.95% and 8.88%), oleic acid (8.39% and 5.71%) and hexanoic acid (4.39% and 7.78%). The in-vitro MTT assay showed that the volatile components of roots and stems of Z. nitidum did not exhibited any cytotoxic activity against human cancer Huh-7 and normal IEC-6 cells. These results indicated the same nature of the volatile constituents in the root and stem of Z. nitidum. This investigation may provide further evidence for expansion of medicinal parts of Z. nitidum.	z. nitidum n-hexadecanoic acid
1	Inhibition of plasma extravasation by abruquinone A, a natural isoflavanquinone isolated from Abrus precatorius.Polymyxin B-induced hind-paw edema was suppressed by abruquinone A, an isoflavanquinone isolated from Abrus precatorius, in normal as well in adrenalectomized mice. Unlike dexamethasone, abruquinone A did not increase the liver glycogen content in fasting adrenalectomized mice. The volume of exuded plasma was significantly reduced by abruquinone A in neurogenic inflammation, passive cutaneous anaphylactic reaction and compound 48/80-induced ear edema. Histamine-, serotonin-, bradykinin- and substance P-induced plasma extravasation in ear edema was also suppressed by abruquinone A. Abruquinone A, like isoproterenol, significantly reduced the bradykinin- and substance P-induced plasma extravasation in normal as well as in compound 48/80-pretreated mice. In addition, abruquinone A suppressed the bradykinin- and substance P-induced ear edema to a significantly greater extent than diphenhydramine/methysergide did. In the in vitro experiments, abruquinone A suppressed the compound 48/80-induced histamine and beta-glucuronidase released from isolated rat peritoneal mast cell preparations. These results suggest that the anti-inflammatory effect of abruquinone A is mediated partly via the suppression of the release of chemical mediators from mast cells and partly via the prevention of vascular permeability changes caused by mediators. The glucocorticoid activity and the release of glucocorticoid hormones from the adrenal gland are probably not involved.	abrus precatorius abruquinone a
2	[Mechanisms and effects of Abelmoschus manihot preparations in treating chronic kidney disease].Abelmoschus manihot (AM) is a medicinal plant rich in twenty kinds of separated active bio-components including flavones, polysaccharides, trannic acid, and long chain hydrocarbons. Among these, total flavones of A. manihot (TFA) are the major active component. In this review, the mechanisms of Huangkui capsule will be discussed as a preparation of AM to treat chronic kidney disease (CKD) by improving immunological reaction, inflammation, renal fibrosis, and renal tubular epithelial injury. Additionally, it has been reported that Huangkui capsule can ameliorate some clinical symptoms, proteinuria, hematuria, and renal function in patients with common CKD, such as nephrotic syndrome, diabetic nephropathy, Henoch-Schonlein purpura nephritis, IgA nephropathy, and membranous nephropathy.

3	2'-Hydroxycinnamaldehyde targets low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 to inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced microglial activation.2'-Hydroxycinnamaldehyde (HCA) isolated from the stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia and its derivative 2'-benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde (BCA) were reported to have anti-angiogenic, anti-proliferative, and anti-inflammatory effects in several human cancer cells and RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. However, effects of HCA/BCA on the neuroinflammation have not been investigated. In the present study, a potential anti-neuroinflammatory effect of HCA/BCA was assessed in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated microglial cultures and microglia/neuroblastoma cocultures. Nitric oxide production, inflammatory gene expression, and signaling pathways were investigated. HCA/BCA significantly decreased the production of nitric oxide and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in microglial cells. HCA/BCA also attenuated the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and TNF-alpha at mRNA level via blockade of ERK, JNK, p38 MAPK, and NF-kappaB activation. Moreover, HCA/BCA was neuroprotective by reducing microglia-mediated neuroblastoma cell death in a microglia-neuroblastoma co-culture. Affinity chromatography and LC-MS/MS analysis identified low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) as a potential molecular target of HCA in microglial cells. Based on the studies using the receptor-associated protein (RAP) that blocks a ligand binding to LRP1 and the siRNA-mediated LRP1 gene silencing, we were able to conclude that HCA inhibited LPS-induced microglial activation via LRP1. Our results suggest that HCA/BCA be anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective in the CNS by targeting LRP1, and may have a therapeutic potential against neuroinflammatory diseases.

1	Treatment of chronic kidney disease using a traditional Chinese medicine, Flos Abelmoschus manihot (Linnaeus) Medicus (Malvaceae).The flowers of Abelmoschus manihot (Linnaeus) Medicus (Malvaceae; Flos A. manihot) have been used in China for many centuries as a traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of chronic kidney disease. The Huangkui capsule is a single-plant drug extracted from the dry corolla of Flos A. manihot that has been approved by China's State Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of chronic glomerulonephritis. The purpose of this paper is to review briefly some of the past experiences in rapid filtration and to present more fully a few facts brought out in recent studies. The primary chemical constituents of Flos A. manihot are flavonoids. In vivo, the flavonoids can be transformed into glucuronide-sulphate conjugates, which are the major metabolites of Flos A. manihot and could contribute to the renoprotective effects in vivo. Flos A. manihot can ameliorate proteinuria, podocyte apoptosis, glomerulosclerosis and mesangial proliferation. The renoprotective effects of Flos A. manihot are related to inhibition of caspase-3 and caspase-8 overexpression, reduction of the infiltration of ED1(+) and ED3(+) macrophages, downregulation of oxidative stress, inhibition of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and serine/threonine kinase pathways and suppression of transforming growth factor-beta1 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha expression. Recently, a multicentre randomized controlled trial demonstrated that Flos A. manihot was more effective than the angiotensin-receptor blocker losartan in reducing proteinuria in patients with primary glomerular disease. Because Flos A. manihot is generally preferred by Chinese patients and clinicians, high-quality trials to test the efficacy and safety of Flos A. manihot are urgently needed.	a. manihot flavonoids

1	Fast and automated characterization of major constituents in rat biofluid after oral administration of Abelmoschus manihot extract using ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry and MetaboLynx.In drug metabolism research, the setting up of a complex series of mass spectrometry experiments and the subsequent analysis of the large amounts of data produced are often time-consuming. In this paper, we describe a strategy using ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/QTOFMS) with automated data analysis software (MetaboLynx) for fast analysis of the metabolic profile of flavonoids in Abelmoschus manihot. Rat plasma and urine samples collected 1 h and 0-12 h after oral administration of Abelmoschus manihot were analyzed by UPLC/QTOFMS within 15 min. The post-acquisition data were processed using MetaboLynx. With key parameters carefully set, MetaboLynx is able to show the presence of a wide range of metabolites with only a limited requirement for manual intervention and data interpretation time. A total of 16 and 38 metabolites were identified in plasma and urine compared with blank samples. The results indicated that methylation and glucuronidation after deglycosylation were the major metabolic pathways of flavonoid glycosides in Abelmoschus manihot. The present study provided important information about the metabolism of flavonoid glycosides in Abelmoschus manihot which will be helpful for fully understanding the mechanism of action of this herb. Furthermore, this work demonstrated the potential of the UPLC/QTOFMS approach using MetaboLynx for fast and automated identification of metabolites from Chinese herbal medicines.	abelmoschus manihot flavonoids
1	Renal protective effect and action mechanism of Huangkui capsule and its main five flavonoids.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The flower of Abelmoschus manihot (Linn.) Medicus (A. manihot), as a traditional Chinese Herbal medicine, was used widely in China with efficacy of inducing diuresis for treating strangurtia, and subdhing swelling and detoxicating. It has been reported that Huangkui capsule, prepared by the extract of the flower of A. manihot, can reduce the content of urinary protein, serum creatinine and serum urea nitrogen in nephropathy rats and processes renoprotective activity, while the action mechanism need to illuminate deeply. AIMS OF THE STUDY: In this study, we investigated the protection effect of Huangkui capsule on tubulointerstitial fibrosis in chronic renal failure (CRF) rats and its mechanism against high glucose-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in renal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2) of its bioactive components. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The animals were divided into normal group, CRF model group and Huangkui capsule-treated group. Hematoxylin eosin (HE) staining and Masson staining were applied to observe pathological changes in renal tissue of different groups. Biochemical indicators including serum urea nitrogen (BUN), urine protein (UP) and serum creatinine (Scr) were measured according to the manufacturer's instructions of kits. HK-2 cell damaged model was established to access the protection effect and action mechanism of five main flavonoids from Huangkui capsule. The experimental cells were divided into eight groups: control group, model group, positive drug group and five main flavonoids treated groups. The dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) assay was used to determine the reactive oxygen species (ROS) in different groups. Western blot was applied to analyze the expression of pathogenesis-related proteins in different groups. RESULTS: The results stated that Huangkui capsule significantly inhibited the elevation of Scr, BUN, UP, the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), phosphorylation-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK1/2), NADPH Oxidase 1, NADPH Oxidase 2 and NADPH Oxidase 4 in adenine-induced CRF rats. The main bioactive components of quercetin (QT), hyperoside (HY), isoquercitrin (IQT), gossypetin-8-O-beta-D-glucuronide (GG) and quercetin-3'-O-glucoside (QG) at the dosage of 100microM, like NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium, exhibited a significant effect on inhibiting the expression of alpha-SMA, p-ERK1/2, NADPH Oxidase 1, NADPH Oxidase 2 and NADPH Oxidase 4 in high glucose-induced HK-2 cells, especially GG. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated that Huangkui capsule and the flavonoids components prevent tubulointerstitial fibrosis in CRF rat involvement in the action mechanism of inhibiting NADPH oxidase/ROS/ERK pathway.	a. manihot flavonoids
1	Phytochemical and biological activities of four wild medicinal plants.The fruits of four wild plants, namely, Capparis decidua, Ficus carica, Syzygium cumini, and Ziziphus jujuba, are separately used as traditional dietary and remedial agents in remote areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. The results of our study on these four plants revealed that the examined fruits were a valuable source of nutraceuticals and exhibited good level of antimicrobial activity. The fruits of these four investigated plants are promising source of polyphenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, and saponins. These four plants' fruits are good sources of iron, zinc, copper, manganese, selenium, and chromium. It was also observed that these fruits are potential source of antioxidant agent and the possible reason could be that these samples had good amount of phytochemicals. Hence, the proper propagation, conservation, and chemical investigation are recommended so that these fruits should be incorporated for the eradication of food and health related problems. 	syzygium cumini alkaloids
2	In vitro anti-Helicobacter pylori action of 30 Chinese herbal medicines used to treat ulcer diseases.Infection by Helicobacter pylori has been ascertained to be an important etiologic impetus leading usually to chronic active gastritis and gastric ulcer with growing incidences worldwide. Utilizing as the test pathogen a standard and five clinic strains of Helicobacter pylori, the antibacterial action was assessed in vitro with ethanol extracts of 30 Chinese herbal medicines which have been frequently prescribed since ancient times for treating gastritis-like disorders. Among the 30 tested materials, the ethanol extracts of Abrus cantoniensis (Fabaceae), Saussurea lappa (Asteraceae) and Eugenia caryophyllata (Myrtaceae) were strongly inhibitory to all test strains (MICs: approximately 40 microg/ml), and Hippophae rhamnoides (Elaeagnaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii (Liliaceae), Magnolia officinalis and Schisandra chinensis (Magnoliaceae), Corydalis yanhusuo (Papaveraceae), Citrus reticulata (Rutaceae), Bupleurum chinense and Ligusticum chuanxiong (Apiaceae) substantially active with MICs close to 60.0 microg/ml. As to antibacterial actions of the aqueous extracts of the same drugs, those derived from Cassia obtusifolia (Fabaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii and Eugenia caryophyllata were remarkably inhibitory against all the six Helicobacter pylori strains (MICs: approximately 60 microg/ml). The work compared almost quantitatively the magnitude of the anti-Helicobacter pylori actions of the 30 most prescribed gastritis-treating Chinese herbal drugs, and located as well some source plants where potent anti-Helicobacter pylori phytochemicals could be characterized.	cassia obtusifolia ulcer diseases
2	Total Phenolics and Total Flavonoids Contents and Hypnotic Effect in Mice of Ziziphus mauritiana Lam. Seed Extract.The seeds of Ziziphus mauritiana Lam. have been traditionally used for treatment of various complications including insomnia and anxiety. They are popularly used as sedative and hypnotic drugs in China, Korea, Myanmar, Vietnam, and other Asian countries. However, no scientific proof on hypnotic activity of Z. mauritiana seeds (ZMS) was reported. In this study, the hypnotic activity of 50% ethanolic extract from ZMS was observed on the loss of righting reflex in mice using pentobarbital-induced sleep mice method. The contents of total phenolics and total flavonoids in the extract were also determined. The results showed that the 50% ethanolic extract from ZMS contained total phenolics 27.62 +- 1.43 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g extract and total flavonoids 0.74 +- 0.03 mg quercetin equivalent (QE)/g extract. Oral administration of the extract at the dose of 200 mg/kg significantly increased the sleeping time in mice intraperitoneally administered with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg body weight). These results supported the traditional use of ZMS for the treatment of insomnia. The seeds of Z. mauritiana should be further developed as an alternative sedative and/or hypnotic product. 	z. mauritiana insomnia
2	Effect of the herbal medicine dai-kenchu-to on gastrointestinal motility in patients with megacystis-microcolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIHS) and chronic idiopathic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIIP): report of two cases.Dai-kenchu-to (DKT), a traditional Japanese herbal medicine (Kampo medicine), composed of zanthoxylum fruit, ginseng root, dried ginger rhizome and malt sugar, is clinically effective for postoperative ileus and chronic constipation. MMIHS and CIIP are severe motility disorder associated with high morbidity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of DKT on functional intestinal obstruction. DKT was clinically effective for gastrointestinal motility in a case with MMIHS, but not effective in one with CIIP. MMIHS and CIIP are speculated to have different pathogenesis regarding gastrointestinal pseudo-obstruction based upon the effect of this drug.	ginger gastrointestinal motility
1	Hepatoprotective activity of leaves of Zanthoxylum armatum DC in CCl4 induced hepatotoxicity in rats.Zanthoxylum armatum DC (Rutaceae) is extensively used in indigenous system of medicine as a tonic, carminative, stomachic and anthelmintic. In the present study, the hepatoprotective activity of the leaves ethanolic extract of Z. armatum (EEZA) was evaluated in CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity in rats. The extract at a dose of 500 mg/kg registered a significant decrease in the levels of serum glutamyl oxalacetic acid transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamyl pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase (ALKP), and serum bilurubin (SBLN) and liver inflammation, which was supported by histopathological studies on liver, thus exhibited a significant hepatoprotective activity. The phytochemical screening of defatted ethanolic extract showed the presence of sterols, alkaloids, flavonoids, and reducing sugars.	z. armatum liver inflammation
2	A monoclonal antibody to an abrin chimera recognizing a unique epitope on abrin A chain confers protection from abrin-induced lethality.Abrin, obtained from the seeds of Abrus precatorius plant, is a potent toxin belonging to the family of type II ribosome-inactivating proteins. Recently, a recombinant vaccine consisting of the A subunits of abrin and its homolog Abrus precatorius agglutinin (APA) was demonstrated to protect mice from abrin lethality. Toward identifying neutralizing epitopes recognized during this response, we generated monoclonal antibodies against the proposed vaccine candidate. One antibody, namely A7C4, the corresponding epitope of which was found to be distal to the active site of the enzymatic A chain, prevented abrin-mediated toxicity on cells and abrin-induced lethality in mice but did not inhibit the catalytic activity of the A chain. The in vivo protection conferred by monoclonal antibody A7C4 highlights the potential use of this antibody as a promising immunotherapeutic. 	abrus precatorius toxicity
1	Effects of selected plant essential oils on the growth and development of mouse preimplantation embryos in vivo.Plant essential oils (EOs) have been reported to have health benefit properties and their preventive and therapeutic use in animals is expected to increase in the future. We evaluated the influence of five essential oils obtained from plant species which are known to have positive antimicrobial, antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects--sage EO from Salvia officinalis L. (Lamiaceae), oregano EO from Origanum vulgare L. (Lamiaceae), thyme EO from Thymus vulgaris L. (Lamiaceae), clove EO from Syzygium aromaticum L. (Myrtaceae) and cinnamon EO from Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume (Lauraceae) on the growth and development of mouse preimplantation embryos in vivo. Essential oils were added to commercial diet at concentrations of 0.25% for sage EO, thyme EO, clove EO, cinnamon EO and 0.1% for oregano EO, and fed to ICR female mice for 2 weeks ad libitum. Females were then mated with males of the same strain. Embryos obtained on Day 4 of pregnancy at the blastocyst stage were stained by morphological triple staining (Hoechst, PI, Calcein-AM) and evaluated using fluorescent microscopy. The effects of essential oils were estimated by the viability of embryos, number of nuclei and distribution of embryos according to nucleus number. Cinnamon EO significantly decreased the number of nuclei and the distribution of embryos according to nucleus number was significantly altered. Sage EO negatively influenced the distribution of embryos according to nucleus number. Clove and oregano EOs induced a significantly increased rate of cell death. Only thyme EO had no detectable effects on embryo development. In conclusion, none of the essential oils had any positive effect on embryo development, but some of them reduced the number of cells and increased the incidence of cell death.	Cinnamon essential oils
2	Abrin poisoning.Abrin is a toxic protein obtained from the seeds of Abrus precatorius (jequirity bean), which is similar in structure and properties to ricin. Abrin is highly toxic, with an estimated human fatal dose of 0.1-1 microgram/kg, and has caused death after accidental and intentional poisoning. Abrin can be extracted from jequirity beans using a relatively simple and cheap procedure. This satisfies one criterion of a potential chemical warfare agent, although the lack of large scale production of jequirity seeds means that quantity is unavailable for ready mass production of abrin for weapons. This contrasts with the huge cultivation of Ricinus seeds for castor oil production. At the cellular level, abrin inhibits protein synthesis, thereby causing cell death. Many of the features observed in abrin poisoning can be explained by abrin-induced endothelial cell damage, which causes an increase in capillary permeability with consequent fluid and protein leakage and tissue oedema (the so-called vascular leak syndrome). Most reported cases of human poisoning involve the ingestion of jequirity beans, which predominantly cause gastrointestinal toxicity. Management is symptomatic and supportive. Experimental studies have shown that vaccination with abrin toxoid may offer some protection against a subsequent abrin challenge, although such an approach is unlikely to be of benefit in a civilian population that in all probability would be unprotected.	abrus precatorius tissue oedema

2	Zanthoxylum bungeanum essential oil induces apoptosis of HaCaT human keratinocytes.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Zanthoxylum bungeanum (ZB), a Chinese herb medicine, has been shown to possess a wide range of biological activities including anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, and anti-microbial activity and has long been used to treat a variety of skin diseases including psoriasis. However, the underlying mechanism of action has not been systematically elucidated. AIM OF THE STUDY: to analyze the chemical composition of the hydro-distilled Zanthoxylum bungeanum essential oil (ZBEO), and to investigate its anti-proliferative activity on HaCaT cells as well as the underlying anti-psoriasis mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The chemical composition of ZBEO was analyzed with gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). HaCaT cells was exposed to different dose of ZBEO added in medium prior to morphologic features analysis as well as cell cycle arrest examination with Flow cytometry. Western blot analysis was employed to estimate the expression level of proteins including caspase-8/9/3, PARP, Bax and Bcl-2. RESULTS: Thirty-nine compounds of the ZBEO were identified GC-MS. ZBEO-treated HaCaT cells showed typical apoptotic morphologic features by DAPI staining assay. The ZBEO significantly inhibited proliferation of HaCaT cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner and induced S phase arrest apoptosis in HaCaT cells. Furthermore, western blot analysis revealed that the ZBEO increased expression of cleaved caspase-8/9/3, PARP, and Bax, decreased Bcl-2 levels. CONCLUSION: ZBEO inhibits the proliferation of HaCaT cells, resulting from the induction of cellular apoptosis through both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. ZBEO is a potential candidate that may be considered for development into an anti-psoriasis drug.	zanthoxylum bungeanum psoriasis
1	A new lignan and other constituents from Zanthoxylum armatum DC.A new lignan (1), named armatumin, along with 25 known compounds, was isolated from Zanthoxylum armatum. The structure of compound 1 was elucidated using spectroscopic methods. Compounds 7, 8, 11, 13, 16, 20 and 21 were first isolated from Z. armatum and compounds 14 and 19 were isolated for the first time from Rutaceae.	z. armatum lignan
1	Imaging cell wall architecture in single Zinnia elegans tracheary elements.The chemical and structural organization of the plant cell wall was examined in Zinnia elegans tracheary elements (TEs), which specialize by developing prominent secondary wall thickenings underlying the primary wall during xylogenesis in vitro. Three imaging platforms were used in conjunction with chemical extraction of wall components to investigate the composition and structure of single Zinnia TEs. Using fluorescence microscopy with a green fluorescent protein-tagged Clostridium thermocellum family 3 carbohydrate-binding module specific for crystalline cellulose, we found that cellulose accessibility and binding in TEs increased significantly following an acidified chlorite treatment. Examination of chemical composition by synchrotron radiation-based Fourier-transform infrared spectromicroscopy indicated a loss of lignin and a modest loss of other polysaccharides in treated TEs. Atomic force microscopy was used to extensively characterize the topography of cell wall surfaces in TEs, revealing an outer granular matrix covering the underlying meshwork of cellulose fibrils. The internal organization of TEs was determined using secondary wall fragments generated by sonication. Atomic force microscopy revealed that the resulting rings, spirals, and reticulate structures were composed of fibrils arranged in parallel. Based on these combined results, we generated an architectural model of Zinnia TEs composed of three layers: an outermost granular layer, a middle primary wall composed of a meshwork of cellulose fibrils, and inner secondary wall thickenings containing parallel cellulose fibrils. In addition to insights in plant biology, studies using Zinnia TEs could prove especially productive in assessing cell wall responses to enzymatic and microbial degradation, thus aiding current efforts in lignocellulosic biofuel production.	zinnia elegans cellulose
2	Hormonal regulation of the basic peroxidase isoenzyme from Zinnia elegans.Xylem differentiation in plants is under strict hormonal regulation. Auxins and cytokinins, together with brassinosteroids (BRs), appear to be the main hormones controlling vascular differentiation. In this report, we study the effect of these hormones on the basic peroxidase isoenzyme from Zinnia elegans (ZePrx), an enzyme involved in lignin biosynthesis. Results showed that auxins and cytokinins induce ZePrx, similarly to the way in which they induce seedling secondary growth (in particular, metaxylem differentiation). Likewise, the exogenous application of BR reduces the levels of ZePrx, in a similar way to their capacity to inhibit seedling secondary growth. Consistent with this notion, the exogenous application of BR reverses the auxin/cytokinin-induced ZePrx expression, but has no effect on the auxin/cytokinin-induced secondary growth. This differential hormonal response is supported by the analysis of the ZePrx promoter, which contains (a) cis-elements directly responsive to these hormones and (b) cis-elements targets of the plethora of transcription factors, such as NAC, MYB, AP2, MADS and class III HD Zip, which are up-regulated during the auxin- and cytokinin-induced secondary growth. Taken together, these results suggest that ZePrx is directly and indirectly regulated by the plethora of hormones that control xylem differentiation, supporting the role of ZePrx in xylem lignification.	zinnia elegans BR
0	Nitidine chloride induces apoptosis and inhibits tumor cell proliferation via suppressing ERK signaling pathway in renal cancer.Nitidine chloride (NC), a natural bioactive alkaloid derived from Zanthoxylum nitidum (Roxb) DC, has been shown to have inhibitory effects on various tumors. However, whether NC could exert anti-cancer activity and the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated in renal cancer cells. In this study, we demonstrated the growth inhibitory and pro-apoptotic effects of NC on renal cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. With cell viability and flow cytometric apoptosis assays, we found that NC potently suppressed the growth of 786-O and A498 cells in a time- and dose- dependent manner. Consistently, the xenograft model performed in nude mice exhibited reduced tumor growth with NC treatment. Mechanically, we presented that NC significantly decreased phosphorylation of ERK and Akt, accompanied by up-regulation of P53, Bax, cleavage caspase-3 and cleavage PARP, downregulation of Bcl-2, caspase-3 and PARP. Furthermore, a specific MEK inhibitor, PD98059, could potentiate the pro-apoptotic effects of NC, which indicated that NC might trigger apoptosis in renal cancer cells partly via inhibition of ERK activity. Taken together, our results imply that NC could be developed as a potential anticancer agent to renal cancer and worthy of further studies. 	NC ERK

1	Anticonvulsant, antidepressant-like activity of Abelmoschus manihot ethanol extract and its potential active components in vivo.Depression is the most common psychiatric comorbidity in patients with epilepsy. Searching for antiepileptic (anticonvulsant) and antidepressant-like medicines from natural products is very important for the treatment of this disease. The flower of Abelmoschus manihot (Linn.) Medicus has been reported to have neuroprotective effect against cerebral ischemia injury. In order to further explore the activity of Abelmoschus manihot on the central nervous system, the anticonvulsant and antidepressant-like effects of Abelmoschus manihot ethanol extract (AMEE) as well as its potential active components in vivo was investigated in the present study. It was found that AMEE could protect mice against PTZ-induced clonic convulsions and mortality. AMEE could also decrease immobility time in the FST in mice. Furthermore, the potential active components of AMEE in rat brain were identified by ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometer (UPLC-MS). Five parent components including isoquercitrin, hyperoside, hibifolin, quercetin-3'-O-glucoside, quercetin and three metabolites were detected in rat brain after administration of AMEE. In conclusion, eight flavonoids were identified in rat brain after administration of AMEE; meanwhile, these flavonoids might represent the potential bioactive components of AMEE and contribute to its anticonvulsant and antidepressant-like activity in vivo.	abelmoschus manihot hibifolin
1	Radical Scavenging Activity of the Essential Oil of Silver Fir (Abies alba).The essential oil of silver fir (Abies alba) is known to help respiratory system and have easing and soothing effect for muscle. In the present study, we investigated the chemical composition, cytotoxicity and its biological activities of silver fir (Abies alba) essential oil. The composition of the oil was analyzed by GC-MS and bornyl acetate (30.31%), camphene (19.81%), 3-carene (13.85%), tricyclene (12.90%), dl-limonene (7.50%), alpha-pinene (2.87%), caryophyllene (2.18%), beta-phellandrene (2.13%), borneol (1.74%), bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene,2,3-dimethyl (1.64%) and alpha-terpinene (1.24%) were the major components in the oil. The results tested by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay indicated that the oil showed no cytotoxic effect, at concentrations of 1 and 5%, for as long as 24 and 3 h, respectively. The antiradical capacity was evaluated by measuring the scavenging activity of the essential oil on the 2,20-diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azino-bis 3-ethyl benzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) radicals. The oil was able to reduce the both radicals dose-dependently, and the concentration required for 50% reduction (RC(50)) against DPPH radicals (2.7 +/- 0.63%) was lower than ABTS radicals (8.5 +/- 0.27%). The antibacterial activity of the oil was also evaluated using disc diffusion method against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Listeria monocytogenes, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, and Vibrio parahaemolyticcus. The oil exhibited no antibacterial activity against all the bacterial strains tested except S. aureus of mild activity.	abies alba essential oil
2	Antimicrobial activity of plants used as medicinals on an indigenous reserve in Rio das Cobras, Parana, Brazil.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: A considerable percentage of global biodiversity is located in Brazil, a country that also has rich cultural and ethnic diversity. In the community of Rio das Cobras, Parana, plants are still widely used in the health care not only by indigenous people but also by the non-indigenous population that inhabits the region. The investigation of the efficacy and safety of these plants in the treatment of infectious diseases provides insights for future studies of these species allowing the appropriated use by the indigenous people, since few or none study has been conducted so far. AIM OF THE STUDY: Evaluate the antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity of some plants used as medicinal on an indigenous reserve in Rio das Cobras, Parana, Brazil. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The aqueous extracts were obtained by decoction and the 50% and 70% hydroalcoholic extracts by turbo extraction. The extracts were tested against strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, Leishmania amazonensis, Poliovirus and HSV-1. Cytotoxicity assay using VERO cells were also performed. RESULTS: None of the extracts had a selectivity index (SI)&gt;1 for any of the tested bacteria. Only Campomanesia eugenioides and Schinus terebinthifolius had an SI&gt;1.0 for all of the tested Candida species. The best anti-Leishmania activity was obtained with Zanthoxylum rhoifolium and Schinus terebinthifolius. Extracts of Cordia americana were the most effective against herpes simplex virus type 1. Zanthoxylum rhoifolium was the most effective against Poliovirus, and Ocimum gratissimum was effective against both Poliovirus and Herpes Simplex virus. Among the plants investigated in the present study, Zanthoxylum rhoifolium had the fewest cytotoxic effect. CONCLUSIONS: The plants investigated in the present study exhibited potential for future pharmacological uses, but additional studies, especially with regard to in vivo toxicity, must be conducted. The results of this preliminary survey are important for the Rio das Cobras Reserve community for the safe and effective use of plants in the treatment of some infectious diseases.	zanthoxylum rhoifolium toxicity

These chemical constituents included 22 lignans, 30 flavonoids, and 19 other phenols. Their structures were determined mainly by analysis of the 1D- and 2D-NMR spectroscopic data. All the 71 isolates were evaluated for their inhibitory activities against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NO production in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Compound 1 exhibited a potent effect with an IC(50) value of 13.7 mug/ml.	abies nephrolepis lignans
1	The Effect of Plant Additives on the Stability of Polyphenols in Dried Black Chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa) Fruit.Chokeberry fruit exhibits a high level of pro-health potential, associated with a significant amount of polyphenol content and antioxidant activity. The fruit is easily perishable and therefore needs to be processed in short order to ensure its availability throughout the year. For this purpose, the fruit is dried, which has an impact on the preservation of bioactive components such as polyphenols. In the study, chokeberry fruit was influenced by a suspension of spices, including clove and cinnamon, and subsequently dried using the freeze-drying, convection, and microwave radiation methods. Freeze-drying was concluded to be the most desirable method of drying, which preserves the largest amount of polyphenols while soaking fruit in a suspension of cinnamon or cloves accelerated the loss of anthocyanins during the storage period. The obtained test results may constitute a valuable source of information for manufacturers in designing new products with increased pro-health potential, whose properties result from the high content of polyphenols and other plant additives.	aronia melanocarpa polyphenols
1	Active compound diffusivity of particle size reduced S. aromaticum and C. cassia fused starch edible films and the shelf life of mutton (Capra aegagrus hircus) meat.In the present study, mathematical models were used to examine the effect of active compound diffusion from edible film (supplemented with S. aromaticum and C. cassia) on the microbial, physical and chemical quality of mutton stored at 4 and 10 C. Cinnamaldehyde and eugenol release from edible film into liquid was found to be 80% and 75% of the equilibrium concentration. Active compound release into meat was 42-51% for cinnamaldehyde and 38-48% for eugenol, in storage temperatures of 4-15 C. Developed mathematical models showed the diffusivity of cinnamaldehyde (0.45x10-15+-0.04x10-15) and eugenol (0.63x10-10+-0.01x10-10) into meat, which was about 40% of that in liquid medium. On comparing physical, chemical and microbial results, shelf life of mutton meat was found to be increased by 1week at storage temperature of 10 C and 3weeks at storage temperature of 4 C.	c. cassia cinnamaldehyde
2	Inhibition of Trypanosoma cruzi by plant extracts used in Chinese medicine.In this work, we assessed the effect of extracts obtained from 17 plants used in traditional Chinese medicine. These extracts were tested in vitro with the epimastigote form of Trypanosoma cruzi, clone Bra C(15) C(2), at 27 degrees C in F-29 medium at a concentration of 100 microg/ml in axenic cultures. Allopurinol was used as reference drug. Seven plant extracts showed inhibitory activities lower than 25%. Pueraria lobata, Mahonia beaei, Dictamus dasycarpus, Kochia scoparia, Sophora flavescens and Ligustrum lucidum showed effects with inhibition values between 25% and 60%, whereas Lithospermum erythrorhizon, Saussurea lappa, Melia toosendan and Cinnamomum cassia showed the greatest inhibitory activity of 100%. The IC(50) of these extracts were: 0.4, 2.4, 1.8 and 3.9 microg/ml, respectively. The MTT assay was made and did not show cytotoxic activity. These results allowed us to suggest that L. erythrorhizon, S. lappa, M. toosendan and C. cassia could be a source of new compounds against T. cruzi.	s. lappa inhibitory activities
1	Aromatic plant-derived essential oil: an alternative larvicide for mosquito control.Five aromatic plants, Carum carvi (caraway), Apium graveolens (celery), Foeniculum vulgare (fennel), Zanthoxylum limonella (mullilam) and Curcuma zedoaria (zedoary) were selected for investigating larvicidal potential against mosquito vectors. Two laboratory-reared mosquito species, Anopheles dirus, the major malaria vector in Thailand, and Aedes aegypti, the main vector of dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever in urban areas, were used. All of the volatile oils exerted significant larvicidal activity against the two mosquito species after 24-h exposure. Essential oil from mullilam was the most effective against the larvae of A. aegypti, while A. dirus larvae showed the highest susceptibility to zedoary oil.	zedoary essential oil
2	Medicinal Plants Targeting Cardiovascular Diseases in View of Avicenna.BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a spectrum of diseases involving the heart and blood vessels, and the first cause of mortality worldwide. Medicinal plants have been used for thousands of years to treat CVD. In Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM), there is a special focus on heart diseases. Avicenna, a Persian physician of the eleventh century compiled a book devoted to this field named "The treatise on cardiac drugs" which is a compendium of TPM knowledge on CVD. Avicenna mentioned 50 cardiovascular active plants and described their therapeutic effects in the treatment of CVDs. METHODS: Here, we perform a detailed search in scientific databases to verify the cardiovascular activities of the medicinal plants suggested by Avicenna. Also, we discussed cardiovascular activities of a number of the most important suggested plants as well as their efficacy in clinical studies. Major bioactive compounds identified from these plants are also discussed. RESULTS: Pharmacological studies have revealed that the majority of these plants are effective in cardiovascular health with various mechanisms. Among them, Crocus sativus L., Cinnamomum cassia (L.) J. Presl, Punica granatum L., Ocimum basilicum L., Elettaria cardamomum (L.) Maton, Melissa officinalis L. and Phyllanthus emblica L. have proved to be more effective. CONCLUSION: The above-mentioned plants can be rich sources for developing new and effective pharmaceuticals for the treatment of CVDs.	elettaria cardamomum (l.) maton cardiovascular disease
2	The Seed of Zizyphus jujuba var. spinosa Attenuates Alzheimer's Disease-Associated Hippocampal Synaptic Deficits through BDNF/TrkB Signaling.Ziziphus jujuba is a plant, which bears fruits and seeds that are used for medicinal purposes in Traditional oriental medicine. The seed of Zizyphus jujuba var. spinosa (EZJ) has been also traditionally used for psychiatric disorders in Chinese and Korean medicines. Recent findings have indicated that EZJ improves memory impairment, a common symptom of various neurological diseases. However, the effects of EZJ on amyloid beta (Abeta) toxicity, which is a main cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD), remain to be elucidated. To illuminate the potential anti-AD effect and mechanism in the mouse hippocampal tissue, we examined the effect of standardized EZJ on Abeta-induced synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) deficit in the hippocampal tissue. EZJ blocked Abeta-induced LTP deficits in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, EZJ increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level in naive hippocampal slices. The finding that the blockade of BDNF receptor reduced the effect of EZJ suggests that EZJ ameliorates the Abeta-induced LTP deficit through BDNF/topomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) signaling. However, transcription or translation inhibitors failed to block the effect of EZJ, suggesting that BDNF synthesis is not required for the action of EZJ on LTP. Finally, we found that EZJ stimulates plasmin activity. In contrast, plasmin inhibitor blocked the effect of EZJ on the Abeta-induced LTP deficit. Our findings indicate that EZJ ameliorates Abeta-induced LTP deficits through BDNF/TrkB signaling. This phenomenon is induced by a regulatory effect of EZJ on the post-translation modification of BDNF.	zizyphus jujuba var AD
1	Mast cell stabilizing and antiallergic activity of Abrus precatorius in the management of asthma.OBJECTIVE: To investigate effects of ethanol extract of Abrus precatorius leaves (EAPL) on egg albumin induced mast cell degranulation in mice and passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in rats. METHODS: In present study ethanol extract of Abrus precatorius leaves (EAPL) at doses of 100, 125, 150 mg/kg i.p were evaluated for preliminary phytochemical screening, acute toxicity studies and egg albumin induced mast cell degranulation in mice and passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in rats. RESULTS: The results of present investigation showed that the LD(50) of EAPL is more than 1 300 mg/kg. EAPL (100-150 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly protect egg albumin induced degranulation of mast cell and inhibit area of leakage of dye in passive cutaneous anaphylaxis. Phytochemical studies observed presence of saponin, alkaloids, flavonoids, and glycosides. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion EAPL possesses anti asthmatic potential.	abrus precatorius saponin
3	2-methoxycinnamaldehyde from Cinnamomum cassia reduces rat myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury in vivo due to HO-1 induction.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Cinnamomum cassia Blume has been used as a traditional Chinese herbal medicine for alleviation of fever, inflammation, chronic bronchitis, and to improve blood circulation. AIM OF THE STUDY: We addressed whether 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde (2-MCA), one of active ingredients of Cinnamomum cassia, reduces vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expression in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-activated endothelial cells and protects ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-injury due to heme oxygenase (HO)-1 induction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult male rats were subjected to 30 min of ischemia by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery followed by 24h of reperfusion. Rats were randomized to receive vehicle or 2-MCA (i.v.) 10 min before reperfusion. RESULTS: Administration of 2-MCA significantly improved I/R-induced myocardial dysfunction by increasing the values of the first derivative (+-dp/dt) of left ventricular pressure and decreased infarct size. In addition, 2-MCA reduced the expression of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), an activator of the inflammatory cascade when released into the extracellular space, and VCAM-1 in I/R myocardium along with increase of HO-1 induction. The reduced injury was accompanied by significantly reduction of neutrophils infiltration and increased SOD activity in ischemic tissues and reduced serum level of cardiac troponin I (cTnI). Furthermore, 2-MCA significantly increased HO-1 induction by translocation of Nrf-2 from cytosol to nucleus in endothelial cells. Inhibition of VCAM-1 expression by 2-MCA was reversed both by SnPPIX, a HO-1 inhibitor and siHO-1 RNA trasfection in TNF-alpha-activated cells. In addition, 2-MCA significantly inhibited NF-kappaB luciferase activity in TNF-alpha-activated endothelial cells. As expected, 2-MCA significantly inhibited monocyte (U937) adhesion to endothelial cells. CONCLUSION: We concluded that 2-MCA protects of myocardial I/R-injury due to antioxidant and anti-inflammatory action possibly by HO-1 induction which can be explained why Cinnamomum cassia has been used in inflammatory disorders.	2-MCA inflammation
2	An herbal formula attenuates collagen-induced arthritis via inhibition of JAK2-STAT3 signaling and regulation of Th17 cells in mice.Wenjinghuoluo prescription, a traditional Chinese medicine compound treatment of rheumatoid arthritis characterized by wind-cold-dampness arthralgia, contains five herbs, namely, C. cassia Presl., Cinnamomum cassia Presl., Paeonia lactiflora Pall., Saposhnikovia divaricate (Turcz.) Schischk., and Clematis chinensis Osbeck. We have reported that WJHL could inhibit the production of inflammatory mediators in immune cells. This study explored the effect and mechanism of WJHL on collagen-induced arthritis mice. WJHL could significantly improve clinical arthritic conditions; inhibit bone erosion and osteophyte formation in joints; decrease expression of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-17); reduce protein expression levels of JAK2, p-JAK2, STAT3, p-STAT3 and gene expression levels of JAK2, STAT3, IL-17A, RORgammat mRNA; elevate osteoprotegerin and Foxp3 mRNA levels and lower Th17 cell proportions in splenocytes. Results suggest that WJHL, specifically regulating the JAK2/STAT3 pathway and Th17 cells, may be a promising herbal medicine candidate for the treatment of RA.	paeonia lactiflora pall RA
1	Validation of a high-performance liquid chromatography method for the determination of (-)-alpha-bisabolol from particulate systems.A reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography method has been developed and validated for determination and quantitation of the natural sesquiterpene (-)-alpha-bisabolol. Furthermore the application of the method was done by characterization of chitosan milispheres and liposomes entrapping Zanthoxylum tingoassuiba essential oil, which contains appreciable amount of (-)-alpha-bisabolol. A reversed-phase C(18) column and gradient elution was used with the mobile phase composed of (A) acetonitrile-water-phosphoric acid (19:80:1) and (B) acetonitrile. The eluent was pumped at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min with UV detection at 200 nm. In the range 0.02-0.64 mg/mL the assay showed good linearity (R(2 )= 0.9999) and specificity for successful identification and quantitation of (-)-alpha-bisabolol in the essential oil without interfering peaks. The method also showed good reproducibility, demonstrating inter-day and intra-day precision based on relative standard deviation values (up to 3.03%), accuracy (mean recovery of 100.69% +/- 1.05%) and low values of detection and quantitation limits (0.0005 and 0.0016 mg/mL, respectively). The method was also robust for showing a recovery of 98.81% under a change of solvent in standard solutions. The suitability of the method was demonstrated by the successful determination of association efficiency of the (-)-alpha-bisabolol in chitosan milispheres and liposomes.	zanthoxylum tingoassuiba sesquiterpene
1	Seed oil and fatty acid content in okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) and related species.Approximately 1100 genebank accessions of okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) and 540 additional accessions that included six of its related species-A. caillei, A. crinitis, A. esculentus, A. ficulneus, A. manihot, A. moschatus and A. tuberculatus-were evaluated for seed oil content using time domain NMR (TD-NMR). Oil content in seed of A. caillei, A. esculentus, A. ficulneus, A. manihot, A. moschatus and A. tuberculatus was in the ranges 2.51-13.61%, 12.36-21.56%, 6.62-16.7%, 16.1-22.0%, 10.3-19.8% and 10.8-23.2%, respectively. Accession PI639680 (A. tuberculatus) had the highest seed oil content (~23%). Accessions of A. esculentus with high seed oil content included PI nos. PI274350 (21.5%), PI538082 (20.9%) and PI538097 (20.9%). Values for the three accessions of A. manihot with the highest seed oil content were PI nos. PI639673 (20.4%), PI639674 (20.9%) and PI639675 (21.9%), all representing var. tetraphyllus. Average percent seed oil in materials of A. esculentus from Turkey and Sudan (17.35% and 17.36%, respectively) exceeded the averages of materials from other locations. Ninety-eight accessions (total of six species) were also examined for fatty acid composition. Values of linoleic acid ranged from 23.6-50.65% in A. esculentus. However, mean linoleic acid concentrations were highest in A. tuberculatus and A. ficulneus. Concentrations of palmitic acid were significantly higher in A. esculentus (range of 10.3-36.35%) when compared to that of other species, and reached a maximum in PI489800 Concentrations of palmitic acid were also high in A. caillei (mean = ~30%). Levels of oleic acid were highest in A. manihot, A. manihot var. tetraphyllus and A. moschatus.	a. manihot var. tetraphyllus oleic acid
1	Higher extracellular pH suppresses tracheary element differentiation by affecting auxin uptake.In an optimized liquid medium containing auxin and cytokinin, mesophyll cells isolated from Zinnia elegans L. seedlings can be induced to differentiate into tracheary elements (TEs) at high frequency. However, it is known that buffering the medium at neutral pH severely suppresses TE differentiation. In the process of modifying the medium, we found that excessive administration of auxin restored the suppression. Based on this finding, we physiologically characterized auxin actions involved in TE differentiation by focusing on the influence of extracellular pH. First, dose/response relationships between auxin [1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)] concentrations and differentiated cell ratios were determined under various extracellular pH conditions. Secondly, intracellular concentrations of free forms and metabolites of auxin species were determined by analyzing extracts from cells cultured with radiolabeled NAA and 2,4-D under different extracellular pH conditions with liquid scintillation counting and thin-layer chromatography autoradiograms. Higher extracellular pH was found to reduce both the auxin potency for inducing TE differentiation and intracellular auxin accumulation. Reduction levels correlatively varied depending on the auxin species. These results suggest that the weakening in auxin potency at higher extracellular pH is ascribed to lower auxin uptake, which leads to decreased intracellular perception of the auxin signal. A model to predict auxin action that considers membrane transport, metabolism, and the perception of auxin is also presented.	zinnia elegans NAA
1	Evaluation of an Electrochemiluminescence Assay for the Rapid Detection of Abrin Toxin.In this article, we detail a comprehensive laboratory evaluation of an immunoassay for the rapid detection of abrin using the Meso Scale Diagnostics Sector PR2 Model 1800. For the assay evaluation, we used inclusivity and exclusivity panels comprised of extracts of 11 Abrus precatorius cultivars and 35 near-neighbor plants, 65 lectins, 26 white powders, 11 closely related toxins and proteins, and a pool of 30 BioWatch filter extracts. The results show that the Meso Scale Diagnostics abrin detection assay exhibits good sensitivity and specificity with a limit of detection of 4 ng/mL. However, the dynamic range of the assay for the quantitation of abrin was limited. We observed a hook effect at higher abrin concentrations, which can lead to potential false negative results. A modification of the assay protocol that incorporates extra wash steps can decrease the hook effect and the potential for false negative results.	abrus precatorius abrin
1	Combined analysis by GC (RI), GC-MS and 13C NMR of the supercritical fluid extract of Abies alba twigs.Two samples (leaves and twigs) of Abies alba Miller from Corsica were extracted using supercritical CO2 and their chemical compositions were compared with those of the essential oils obtained from the same batch of plant material. In total 45 components were identified using combined analysis by GC (RI), GC-MS and 13C NMR. It was observed that the contents of monoterpenes (mainly represented by limonene, alpha-pinene and camphene) were significantly lower in the supercritical fluid extract (SFE) than in the essential oil (EO). Conversely, the proportions of sesquiterpenes were much higher in CO2 extracts than in essential oils (around 30% vs 4%). Cis-abienol, a diterpene alcohol, was identified only in SFE, and the proportions of this constituent (7.5% and 17.3%) were determined using quantitative 13C NMR since it was under estimated using the standard conditions of GC.	abies alba camphene
1	[Determination of triterpenoic acids in fruits of Ziziphus jujuba using HPLC-MS with polymeric ODS column].A simple and sensitive method has been developed to simultaneously determine betunilic acid, oleanolic acid and ursolic acid in the fruits of Ziziphus jujuba from different regions by HPLC-MS. This HPLC assay was performed on PAH polymeric C18 bonded stationary phase column with mobile phase contained acetonitrile-water (90: 10) and with negative ESI detection mode. The developed approach was characterized by short time consumption for chromatographic separation, high sensitivity and good reliability so as to meet the requirements for rapid analysis of large-batch fruits of Z. jujuba from different habitats.	z. jujuba betunilic acid
1	Relative bioavailability of coumarin from cinnamon and cinnamon-containing foods compared to isolated coumarin: a four-way crossover study in human volunteers.SCOPE: Cassia cinnamon contains high levels (up to 1 %) of coumarin. Heavy consumption of this spice may result in a dose exceeding the tolerable daily intake (TDI). In this context, the question was raised whether coumarin in the plant matrix of cinnamon has the same bioavailability as isolated coumarin. METHODS AND RESULTS: A four-way crossover study was performed, in which the same dose of 12 mg coumarin was administered in different formulations to 24 healthy volunteers. The relative extent of absorption measured as urinary excretion of the main metabolite 7-hydroxycoumarin (7OHC) was found to be 62.8% for isolated coumarin in a capsule (reference), 56.0% for cinnamon in capsules, 66.1% for cinnamon tea, and 54.7% for cinnamon in rice pudding (means, n=23, observation period 8 hours). Additionally, 7OHC plasma levels were measured for 105 minutes after administration and revealed a fast absorption of coumarin from cinnamon tea leading to the highest peak concentrations. CONCLUSION: The relative extent of absorption of coumarin from powder of cassia cinnamon is only slightly lower than that of isolated coumarin. Therefore, the TDI of coumarin can be used for risk assessment of coumarin exposure from cinnamon-containing meals.	cinnamon 7-hydroxycoumarin
2	Anthelmintic screening of Zimbabwean plants traditionally used against schistosomiasis.Extracts of 23 plant species used popularly against schistosomiasis in Zimbabwe were screened for their anthelmintic effect. Schistosomules of the trematode Schistosoma mansoni and cysticercoids of the cestode Hymenolepis diminuta were studied in vitro. The material consisted of 58 plant extracts, of which 37 killed the newly excysted cysticercoids within an hour, when incubated in a culture medium. Lethal concentrations varied from 0.8 to 103 mg/ml. All plant extracts showed activity against the tapeworms after 24 h. Ten of the best extracts were also tested against schistosomules. Five of these extracts showed activity. Lethal concentrations varied from 0.6 to 33.8 mg/ml of dry plant material. Extracts of stem and root from Abrus precatorius (Fabaceae), of root bark and leaves from Ozoroa insignis (Anacardiaceae) and of root bark from Zizyphus mucronata (Rhamnaceae) gave the best results against tapeworms. The best results against schistosomules were obtained with stem and root extracts from Abrus precatorius (Fabaceae) and stem bark from Elephantorrhiza goetzei (Mimosaceae). Although the activity of root and root bark extracts commonly used in traditional medicine was verified in this study, our results showed that also extracts from leaf and stem can be effective anthelmintics.	ozoroa insignis schistosomiasis
1	Application of microdialysis for elucidating the existing form of hyperoside in rat brain: comparison between intragastric and intraperitoneal administration.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort) is an important anti-depressant herb used in clinic and commonly prescribed for mild depression. Hyperoside is one of the major components of H. perforatum and is also detected in many plant species such as Abelmoschus manihot, Black Currant, Rosa agrestis, Apocynum venetum and Nelumbo nucifera. AIM OF THE STUDY: As the hyperoside showed CNS (central nervous system) protective activity (e.g. anti-depressant-like effect), the possibility of hyperoside or its metabolites to reach CNS should be investigated. Moreover, the pharmacokinetics profile of hyperoside or its metabolites in rat brain should be studied for further elucidating the mechanism of hyperoside action on CNS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A simple method for simultaneous determination of unbound hyperoside and its metabolite 3'-O-methyl-hyperoside in rat brain was developed by using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) and microdialysis technique. This method was applied for pharmacokinetics study of hyperoside and 3'-O-methyl-hyperoside in rat brain after intragastric (i.g.) and intraperitoneally (i.p.) administration of hyperoside in vivo. RESULTS: Results showed that neither hyperoside nor its metabolites were detected in rat brain after i.g. administration but both compounds could be detected after i.p. administration. Considering the activity of hyperoside through both i.g. and i.p. administration, our results imply that the active components of hyperoside in vivo might be different. Therefore, further studies are needed to identify the active components of hyperoside in vivo through these two different routes. Moreover, non-oral administration route (e.g., i.p.) should be further investigated and be explored to obtain higher bioavailability and better activity for hyperoside. Our results also showed that the real existing form of hyperoside in rat brain were hyperoside and its methylated metabolite with maximum concentration to be 63.78 ng/mL and 24.66 ng/mL after 20mg/kg i.p. administration, respectively. Therefore, a more reasonable concentration of hyperoside should be considered in in vitro assay to reflect the real situation of hyperoside concentration in vivo. CONCLUSION: Due to the wide use of herbal remedies containing hyperoside, our investigation will contribute to further clarifying the action of this substance. Moreover, this method will be applied for clinical pharmacokinetics study of hyperoside and its metabolite as well as herbs that contain hyperoside.	rosa agrestis hyperoside
1	Foliar and cortex oleoresin variability of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) in Albania.Terpene composition of needle and cortical oleoresin from lateral shoots were analyzed by GC/MS for four Silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) populations scattered in natural species range in Albania. More than sixty compounds were detected in the needle oleoresin, which was characterized by a high content of alpha-pinene, camphene, beta-pinene, limonene and bornyl acetate. Three monoterpenes, alpha-pinene, beta-pinene and limonene, and two sesquiterpenes, beta-caryophyllene and germacrene D, comprised the majority of cortical oleoresin. The terpene composition differences among the populations that led to the recognition of two chemotypes. The needle oleoresin from the provinces of Puka, Bulqiza and Llogara were characterised by high amounts of beta-pinene, camphene and alpha-pinene and low amounts of limonene, while that from Drenova had high amounts of beta-pinene and limonene. A similar pattern was found in the cortical oleoresin with the exception of camphene that was a minor contributor. Geographical and seasonal variation between the populations was, also, investigated. Multivariate analysis of both needle and cortical oleoresin separated Drenova (southeastern population) from the other sites. When both major monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes were considered four chemical profiles could be attributed. Based on their chemical profiles, the populations can be divided into two groups: Populations with high content of beta-pinene and alpha-pinene but a low content of limonene (Puka, Bulqiza and Llogara), typical of most of A. alba populations in all its distribution range. Population with a high content of limonene and a moderate content of beta-pinene and alpha-pinene (Drenova).	a. alba germacrene d
2	Anthelmintic screening of Sub-Saharan African plants used in traditional medicine.AIM OF STUDY: This study screened for anthelmintic activity of plant species traditionally used in the treatment of intestinal parasites and their symptoms in Sub-Saharan Africa in an effort to confirm their local use and aid in the search for new compounds since resistance is a growing concern. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Aqueous and organic extracts of 33 plant parts from 17 plant species traditionally used in the treatment of intestinal infections in Sub-Saharan Africa were evaluated for their anthelmintic activity. This activity was assessed using a standard motility assay against a levamisole resistant strain of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Anthelmintic activity was confirmed in 12 plant species. Of these, eight showed strong evidence of activity (p&lt;0.0001), one exhibited moderate evidence of activity (p&lt;0.001), three demonstrated weak evidence of activity (p&lt;0.05), and five plants showed no evidence of activity. The eight species with the strongest evidence of activity were Acacia polyacantha, Anogeissus leiocarpus, Bridelia micrantha, Cassia sieberiana, Combretum nigricans, Grewia bicolor, Strychnos spinosa and Ziziphus mucronata. In only two cases, Anogeissus leiocarpus and Cassia sieberiana, anthelmintic activity has been previously confirmed. The activity demonstrated against the levamisole resistant strain of Caenorhabditis elegans and the presence of molecules in these plants known or suspected of having a broad spectrum of activity provide support for further study of these plants and their compounds as possible treatments for parasitic worm infections.	caenorhabditis elegans intestinal infections
1	Characterization and biological evaluation of six new dimeric lignans with an unusual alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone motif from Zanthoxylum simulans.Investigation of the bark of Zanthoxylum simulans afforded six new dimeric lignans zanthpodocarpins C-H (1-6) bearing an unusual alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone group. The new structures of 1-6 were determined by using detailed spectroscopic analysis. All of the isolated compounds were examined for their inhibitory effects against rat joint synovial cell and splenocyte proliferation. Compounds 1-6 showed potent anti-inflammatory activities with IC50 values ranging from 18.6 to 36.1muM, and 13.8 to 74.3muM. 	zanthoxylum simulans alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone
1	Arabidopsis thaliana peroxidases involved in lignin biosynthesis: in silico promoter analysis and hormonal regulation.Phytohormones such as auxins, cytokinins, and brassinosteroids, act by means of a signaling cascade of transcription factors of the families NAC, MYB, AP2 (APETALA2), MADS and class III HD (homeodomain) Zip, regulating secondary growth. When the hormonal regulation of Zinnia elegans peroxidase (ZePrx), an enzyme involved in lignin biosynthesis, was studied, it was found that this peroxidase is sensitive to a plethora of hormones which control xylem lignification. In a previous study we sought Arabidopsis thaliana homologues to ZePrx. Peroxidases 4, 52, 49 and 72 are the four peroxidases that fulfill the restrictive conditions that a peroxidase involved in lignification must have. In the present study, we focus our attention on hormonal regulation in order to establish the minimal structural and regulatory elements contained in the promoter region which an AtPrx involved in lignification must have. The results indicate that of the four peroxidases selected in our previous study, the one most likely to be homologous to ZePrx is AtPrx52. The results suggest that hormones such as auxins, cytokinins and BRs directly regulate AtPrx52, and that the AtPrx52 promoter may be the target of the set of transcription factors (NAC, MYB, AP2 and class I and III HD Zip) which are up-regulated by these hormones during secondary growth. In addition, the AtPrx52 promoter contains multiple copies of all the putative cis-elements (the ACGT box, the OCS box, the OPAQ box, the L1BX, the MYCL box and the W box) known to confer regulation by NO and H2O2.	zinnia elegans lignin
2	Histochemical localization of glycoconjugates on microglial cells in Alzheimer's disease brain samples by using Abrus precatorius, Maackia amurensis, Momordica charantia, and Sambucus nigra lectins.Four lectins (Abrus precatorius (APA), Maackia amurensis (MAA), Momordica charantia (MCA) and Sambucus nigra (SNA)) have been used to identify glycohistochemically the microglial cells (MGC) activation in autoptic brain samples from Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects. Three of these lectins (APA, MAA and MCA) have utilized as microglial cell markers for the first time. The identification of new markers for the study of MGC is very important to better understand the role of these type of cells in the metabolic/dismetabolic control of betaA4 in AD which still represents a vexata questio.

1	Zizimauritic acids A-C, three novel nortriterpenes from Ziziphus mauritiana.Zizimauritic acids A-C (1-3), three novel nortriterpenes with a unique A-nor-E-seco spiro-lactone ceanothane-type triterpene skeleton, together with 3 known triterpenes ceanothenic acid (4), betulinic acid (5), and ceanothic acid (6), were isolated from the roots of Ziziphus mauritiana. Compounds 1-4 showed cytotoxicities with the IC(50) values ranging from 5.05 to 11.94 mug/ml, and compounds 1 and 3 showed an inhibitory effect on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus with the IC(50) values 2.17 and 12.79 mug/ml. A plausible biosynthetic pathway of compounds 1-3 was proposed.	ziziphus mauritiana nortriterpenes
2	A novel drug candidate for Alzheimer's disease treatment: gx-50 derived from Zanthoxylum bungeanum.This study focused on a promising drug candidate, N-[2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethyl]-3-phenyl-acrylamide (gx-50), a compound extracted from Sichuan pepper (Zanthoxylum Bungeanum), to determine whether it would be an effective therapeutic for Alzheimer's disease (AD) via biological experiments. In vivo, we determined the pharmacokinetic profile of gx-50 and evaluated the effect of gx-50 on the cognitive abilities of amyloid-beta protein precursor transgenic (AbetaPP-Tg) mice by Morris water maze testing. In addition, we examined the effects of gx-50 on amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers in the brains of AbetaPP-Tg mice by immunohistochemistry. In vitro, we observed a direct effect of gx-50 on Abeta oligomers by atomic force microscopy, detected the neuroprotective effects of gx-50 by western blotting and cell apoptosis assays, and measured its effects on intracellular calcium currents by laser confocal microscopy. Experiments in vivo showed that gx-50 could penetrate the blood brain barrier and improve the cognitive abilities of mice. Moreover, gx-50 treatment decreased the accumulation of Abeta oligomers in the cerebral cortex. The results in vitro demonstrated that gx-50 could disassemble Abeta oligomers, inhibit Abeta-induced neuronal apoptosis and apoptotic gene expression, and reduce neuronal calcium toxicity. These results strongly suggest that gx-50 is a potential candidate drug for treating AD.	zanthoxylum bungeanum AD

4	Total flavones of Abelmoschus manihot improve diabetic nephropathy by inhibiting the iRhom2/TACE signalling pathway activity in rats.CONTEXT: Total flavones extracted from Abelmoschus manihot L. (Malvaceae) medic (TFA) have been proven clinically effective at improving renal inflammation and glomerular injury in chronic kidney disease (CKD). OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the function of TFA as an inhibitor of iRhom2/TACE (tumour necrosis factor-alpha converting enzyme) signalling and investigated its anti-DN (diabetic nephropathy) effects in a DN rat model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vitro, cells were treated with 200 mug/mL advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and then co-cultured with 20 mug/mL TFA for 24 h. Real time PCR, western blotting and co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed. In vivo, DN was induced in 8 week old male Sprague-Dawley rats via unilateral nephrectomy and intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin, then TFA were administered to rats by gavage for 12 weeks at three different doses (300, 135 and 75 mg/kg/d). 4-Phenylbutanoic acid (2.5 mg/kg/d) was used as a positive control. RESULTS: IC50 of TFA is 35.6 muM in HK2 and 39.6 muM in HRMC. TFA treatment (20 muM) inhibited the activation of iRhom2/TACE signalling in cultured cells induced by AGEs. LD50&gt;26 g/kg and ED50=67 mg/kg of TFA in rat by gavage, TFA dose-dependently downregulated the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and exerted anti-inflammatory effects significantly though inhibiting the activation of iRhom2/TACE signalling. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that TFA could dose-dependently ameliorate renal inflammation by inhibiting the activation of iRhom2/TACE signalling and attenuating ER stress. These results suggest that TFA has potential therapeutic value for the treatment of DN in humans.	TACE diabetic nephropathy
2	In vitro anti-Helicobacter pylori action of 30 Chinese herbal medicines used to treat ulcer diseases.Infection by Helicobacter pylori has been ascertained to be an important etiologic impetus leading usually to chronic active gastritis and gastric ulcer with growing incidences worldwide. Utilizing as the test pathogen a standard and five clinic strains of Helicobacter pylori, the antibacterial action was assessed in vitro with ethanol extracts of 30 Chinese herbal medicines which have been frequently prescribed since ancient times for treating gastritis-like disorders. Among the 30 tested materials, the ethanol extracts of Abrus cantoniensis (Fabaceae), Saussurea lappa (Asteraceae) and Eugenia caryophyllata (Myrtaceae) were strongly inhibitory to all test strains (MICs: approximately 40 microg/ml), and Hippophae rhamnoides (Elaeagnaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii (Liliaceae), Magnolia officinalis and Schisandra chinensis (Magnoliaceae), Corydalis yanhusuo (Papaveraceae), Citrus reticulata (Rutaceae), Bupleurum chinense and Ligusticum chuanxiong (Apiaceae) substantially active with MICs close to 60.0 microg/ml. As to antibacterial actions of the aqueous extracts of the same drugs, those derived from Cassia obtusifolia (Fabaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii and Eugenia caryophyllata were remarkably inhibitory against all the six Helicobacter pylori strains (MICs: approximately 60 microg/ml). The work compared almost quantitatively the magnitude of the anti-Helicobacter pylori actions of the 30 most prescribed gastritis-treating Chinese herbal drugs, and located as well some source plants where potent anti-Helicobacter pylori phytochemicals could be characterized.	saussurea lappa gastric ulcer
2	Evaluation of natural products on inhibition of inducible cyclooxygenase (COX-2) and nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in cultured mouse macrophage cells.The inhibitors of prostaglandin biosynthesis and nitric oxide production have been considered as potential anti-inflammatory and cancer chemopreventive agents. In this study, we evaluated approximately 170 methanol extracts of natural products including Korean herbal medicines for the inhibition of prostaglandin E(2) production (for COX-2 inhibitors) and nitric oxide formation (for iNOS inhibitors) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophages RAW264.7 cells. As a result, several extracts such as Aristolochia debilis, Cinnamomum cassia, Cinnamomum loureirii, Curcuma zedoaria, Eugenia caryophyllata, Pterocarpus santalius, Rehmania glutinosa and Tribulus terrestris showed potent inhibition of COX-2 activity (&gt;80% inhibition at the test concentration of 10 micro g/ml). In addition, the extracts of A. debilis, Caesalpinia sappan, Curcuma longa, C. zedoaria, Daphne genkwa and Morus alba were also considered as potential inhibitors of iNOS activity (&gt;70% inhibition at the test concentration of 10 micro g/ml). These active extracts mediating COX-2 and iNOS inhibitory activities are warranted for further elucidation of active principles for development of new cancer chemopreventive and/or anti-inflammatory agents.	cinnamomum loureirii cancer
2	Huangkui capsule, an extract from Abelmoschus manihot (L.) medic, improves diabetic nephropathy via activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha/gamma and attenuating endoplasmic reticulum stress in rats.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Abelmoschus manihot (L.) medic (AM) is a natural medicinal plant used for the treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in China. Huangkui capsule (HKC), an extract from AM, has been proved clinically effective in improving renal inflammation and glomerular injury in CKD. However, the mechanisms of HKC are still not fully understood. AIM OF THE STUDY: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha/gamma dual agonists have the potential to be used as therapeutic agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy (DN). This study evaluated the function of Huangkui capsule (HKC), an extract from Abelmoschus manihot (L.) medic (AM), as a dual agonist for PPARalpha/gamma and investigated its anti-DN effects in a DN rat model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ChIP and reporter gene assays were performed and the expression of PPARalpha/gamma target genes was monitored to examine the ability of HKC to activate PPARalpha/gamma. DN was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats via unilateral nephrectomy and intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. HKC was administered to the diabetic nephropathy rats at three different doses: high dose HKC (300mg/kg/d); middle dose HKC (175mg/kg/d); and low dose HKC (75mg/kg/d). Irbesartan (4mg/kg/d body weight) was used as a positive control. Following 12 weeks' treatment, we measured general status, renal morphological appearance, proteinuria, blood biochemical parameters, and glomerular morphological changes. The expression of collagen IV, TGFbeta, TNFalpha and IL-6 in renal tissue was evaluated. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in renal tissue was also analyzed. RESULTS: HKC enhanced the transcriptional activity of PPARalpha and PPARgamma in cultured cells, livers and kidneys of DN rats, and it reduced serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels and fat in livers of DN rats. Furthermore, HKC reduced the expressions of inflammatory genes in kidneys of DN rats. Strikingly, HKC reduced ER stress and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activation in the liver and kidney of DN rats and subsequently improved renal injury. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that HKC improved lipid metabolic disorders by activating PPARalpha/gamma and attenuating ER stress. HKC could dose-dependently ameliorate renal inflammation and glomerular injury in DN rats. These results suggest that HKC has potential as an anti-DN agent for the treatment of DN in humans.	abelmoschus manihot diabetic nephropathy
2	Anticancer Potential of Aqueous Ethanol Seed Extract of Ziziphus mauritiana against Cancer Cell Lines and Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma.Ziziphus mauritiana (Lamk.) is a fruit tree that has folkloric implications against many ailments and diseases. In the present study, anticancer potential of seed extract of Ziziphus mauritiana in vitro against different cell lines (HL-60, Molt-4, HeLa, and normal cell line HGF) by MTT assay as well as in vivo against Ehrich ascites carcinoma bearing Swiss albino mice was investigated. The extract was found to markedly inhibit the proliferation of HL-60 cells. Annexin and PI binding of treated HL-60 cells indicated apoptosis induction by extract in a dose-dependent manner. The cell cycle analysis revealed a prominent increase in sub Go population at concentration of 20 mug/ml and above. Agarose gel electrophoresis confirmed DNA fragmentation in HL-60 cells after 3 h incubation with extract. The extract also exhibited potent anticancer potential in vivo. Treatment of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma bearing Swiss albino mice with varied doses (100-800 mg/kg b.wt.) of plant extract significantly reduced tumor volume and viable tumor cell count and improved haemoglobin content, RBC count, mean survival time, tumor inhibition, and percentage life span. The enhanced antioxidant status in extract-treated animals was evident from decline in levels of lipid peroxidation and increased levels of glutathione, catalase, and superoxide dismutase.	ziziphus mauritiana ehrlich ascites carcinoma
3	Cinnamaldehyde/chemotherapeutic agents interaction and drug-metabolizing genes in colorectal cancer.Cinnamaldehyde is an active monomer isolated from the stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia, a traditional oriental medicinal herb, which is known to possess marked antitumor effects in vitro and in vivo. The aim of the present study was to examine the potential advantages of using cinnamaldehyde in combination with chemotherapeutic agents commonly used in colorectal carcinoma (CRC) therapy, as well as to investigate the effect of cinnamaldehyde on chemotherapeutic-associated gene expression. The synergistic interaction of cinnamaldehyde and chemotherapeutic agents on human CRC HT-29 and LoVo cells was evaluated using the combination index (CI) method. The double staining with Annexin V conjugated to fluorescein-isothiocyanate and phosphatidylserine was employed for apoptosis detection. The expression of drug-metabolizing genes, including excision repair cross-complementing 1 (ERCC1), orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRT), thymidylate synthase (TS), breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1) and topoisomerase 1 (TOPO1), all in HT-29 and LoVo cells, with or without the addition of cinnamaldehyde, was examined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Cinnamaldehyde had a synergistic effect on the chemotherapeutic agents cytotoxicity in HT-29 and LoVo cells. In addition, cinnamaldehyde suppressed BRCA1, TOPO1, ERCC1 and TS mRNA expression, except for OPRT expression, which was markedly upregulated. Our findings indicate that cinnamaldehyde appears to be a promising candidate as an adjuvant in combination therapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and oxaliplatin (OXA), two chemotherapeutic agents used in CRC treatment. The possible mechanisms of its action may involve the regulation of drug-metabolizing genes.	cinnamaldehyde colorectal carcinoma
1	Triterpene saponins from Abrus cantoniensis (Leguminosae). II. Characterization of six new saponins having a branched-chain sugar.The chemical structures of abrisaponins So1 (1), So2 (2), D2 (3), D3 (4), F (5) and SB (6), six of twenty-three saponins from Abri Herba, the whole plants of Abrus cantoniensis (Leguminosae), were investigated. They were elucidated to be 3-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 --&gt; 2)-[O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1--&gt;3)]-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1 --&gt; 2)-beta-D-glucuronopyranosyl [sequence: see text] (designated as beta-abritetraosyl) sophoradiol (1), 3-O-beta-abritetraosyl sophoradiol 22-O-beta-D-xylopyranoside (2), 3-O-beta-abritetraosyl abrisapogenol D (3), O-beta-abritetraosyl abrisapogenol D 22-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (4), 3-O-beta-abritetraosyl abrisapogenol F (5) and 3-O-beta-abritetraosyl soyasapogenol B (6), respectively.	abrus cantoniensis saponins
1	Chromium and polyphenols from cinnamon improve insulin sensitivity.Naturally-occurring compounds that have been shown to improve insulin sensitivity include Cr and polyphenols found in cinnamon (Cinnamomon cassia). These compounds also have similar effects on insulin signalling and glucose control. The signs of Cr deficiency are similar to those for the metabolic syndrome and supplemental Cr has been shown to improve all these signs in human subjects. In a double-blind placebo-controlled study it has been demonstrated that glucose, insulin, cholesterol and HbA1c are all improved in patients with type 2 diabetes following Cr supplementation. It has also been shown that cinnamon polyphenols improve insulin sensitivity in in vitro, animal and human studies. Cinnamon reduces mean fasting serum glucose (18-29%), TAG (23-30%), total cholesterol (12-26%) and LDL-cholesterol (7-27%) in subjects with type 2 diabetes after 40 d of daily consumption of 1-6 g cinnamon. Subjects with the metabolic syndrome who consume an aqueous extract of cinnamon have been shown to have improved fasting blood glucose, systolic blood pressure, percentage body fat and increased lean body mass compared with the placebo group. Studies utilizing an aqueous extract of cinnamon, high in type A polyphenols, have also demonstrated improvements in fasting glucose, glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in women with insulin resistance associated with the polycystic ovary syndrome. For both supplemental Cr and cinnamon not all studies have reported beneficial effects and the responses are related to the duration of the study, form of Cr or cinnamon used and the extent of obesity and glucose intolerance of the subjects.	cinnamon polyphenols
1	Constituents of the root wood of Zanthoxylum wutaiense with antitubercular activity.Bioassay-guided fractionation of the root wood of Zanthoxylum wutaiense led to the isolation of 11 new compounds, wutaiensol methyl ether (1), demethoxywutaiensol methyl ether (2), methyl wutaiensate (3), methyl 7-hydroxyanodendroate (4), methyl 7-methoxyanodendroate (5), wutaifuranol (6), 7-methoxywutaifuranol (7), 7-methoxywutaifuranal (8), methyl wutaifuranate (9), methyl 7-methoxybenzofuran-5-carboxylate (10), and wutaipyranol (12), together with another 37 known compounds, of which one, 7-methoxybenzofuran-5-carboxaldehyde (11), was not previously known as a plant constituent. The structures of these isolates were identified by means of spectroscopic analysis. Five of these isolates were found to be antitubercular constituents, namely, methyl 7-methoxyanodendroate (5), 7-methoxywutaifuranal (8), wutaiensal (13), dictamnine (14), and gamma-fagarine (15), which exhibited antitubercular activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, showing MIC values of 35, 35, 30, 30, and 30 microg/mL, respectively.	zanthoxylum wutaiense dictamnine
1	Toxicity of Zanthoxylum piperitum and Zanthoxylum armatum oil constituents and related compounds to Stomoxys calcitrans (Diptera: Muscidae).Zanthoxylum plants (Rutaceae) have drawn attention because they contain insecticidal principles against insects. An assessment was made of the insecticidal and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activities of Zanthoxylum piperitum steam distillate and Zanthoxylum armatum seed oil, their 28 constituents, and eight structurally related compounds against female stable fly, Stomoxys calcitrans (L.). Results were compared with those of two organophosphorus insecticides chlorpyrifos and dichlorvos. Potent fumigant toxicity was observed with cuminaldehyde, thymol, (1S)-(-)-verbenone, (-)-myrtenal, carvacrol, (S)-(Z)-verbenol, Zanthoxylum piperitum steam distillate, cuminyl alcohol, Zanthoxylum armatum seed oil, piperitone, (-)-(Z)-myrtanol, and citronellal (LC50, 0.075-0.456 microg/cm3). However, they were five orders of magnitude less toxic than either chlorpyrifos or dichlorvos. An in vitro bioassay using female fly heads indicates that strong AChE inhibition was produced by citronellyl acetate, alpha-pinene, thymol, carvacrol, and alpha-terpineol (1.20-2.73 mM), but no direct correlation between fly toxicity and AChE inhibition by the test compounds was observed. Structure-activity relationships indicate that structural characteristics, such as carbon skeleton, degrees of saturation and types of functional groups, and vapor pressure parameter, appear to play a role in determining toxicities of the test monoterpenoids to stable flies. Global efforts to reduce the level of highly toxic synthetic insecticides in the agricultural environment justify further studies on Z. piperitum and Z. armatum oil-derived materials as potential insecticides for the control of stable fly populations.	z. piperitum citronellyl acetate
1	Rapid structural characterization of isomeric benzo[c]phenanthridine alkaloids from the roots of Zanthoxylum nitidium by liquid chromatography combined with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry.The fragmentation mechanism of six alkaloids, namely: dihydronitidine, dihydrochelerythrine, 8-acetonyldihydronitidine, 8-acetonyldrochelerythrine, nitidine and 1,3-bis(8-dihydronitidinyl)acetone, was investigated by electrospray ionization multi-stage tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MSn). Tandem mass spectrometry experiments indicated that different substitution sites of the methoxyl groups at C-9 and C-10 or at C-10 and C-11 determined the different abundances of the MS2 fragmentation ions using the same collision energy. According to the different abundances of MS2 product ions, positional isomeric benzo[c]phenanthridine alkaloids can be differentiated. Moreover, ten constituents in the crude alkaloidol extract from the roots of Zanthoxylum nitidium were rapidly identified by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/MSn), through comparing the retention times and ESI-MSn spectra with the authentic standards. This work demonstrates that not only the characteristic fragments but also the characteristic abundances of the fragment ions can be used for detailed structural characterization.	zanthoxylum nitidium nitidine
2	Evaluation of natural products on inhibition of inducible cyclooxygenase (COX-2) and nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in cultured mouse macrophage cells.The inhibitors of prostaglandin biosynthesis and nitric oxide production have been considered as potential anti-inflammatory and cancer chemopreventive agents. In this study, we evaluated approximately 170 methanol extracts of natural products including Korean herbal medicines for the inhibition of prostaglandin E(2) production (for COX-2 inhibitors) and nitric oxide formation (for iNOS inhibitors) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophages RAW264.7 cells. As a result, several extracts such as Aristolochia debilis, Cinnamomum cassia, Cinnamomum loureirii, Curcuma zedoaria, Eugenia caryophyllata, Pterocarpus santalius, Rehmania glutinosa and Tribulus terrestris showed potent inhibition of COX-2 activity (&gt;80% inhibition at the test concentration of 10 micro g/ml). In addition, the extracts of A. debilis, Caesalpinia sappan, Curcuma longa, C. zedoaria, Daphne genkwa and Morus alba were also considered as potential inhibitors of iNOS activity (&gt;70% inhibition at the test concentration of 10 micro g/ml). These active extracts mediating COX-2 and iNOS inhibitory activities are warranted for further elucidation of active principles for development of new cancer chemopreventive and/or anti-inflammatory agents.	daphne genkwa cancer
2	Antiproliferative and anticarcinogenic effects of an aqueous preparation of Abies alba and Viscum album se abies, on a L-1210 malignant cell line and tumor-bearing Wistar rats.Extracts of plants have been widely tested for possible anticarcinogenic properties. In the present study a traditional remedy, consisting of an aqueous extract of mixed parts of the tree Abies alba and its mistletoe Viscum album se abies was tested on benzo(alpha)pyrene(BaP)-induced tumors in Wistar rats and on the L-1210 malignant cell line. Two main groups of male Wistar rats subcutaneously injected by 10 mg of BaP, a dose inducing 100% carcinogenesis, a control group (C-G, 15 rats) and a treatment group(TR-G, 18 rats), were used for the study. Five animals bearing BaP-induced tumors were also tested (TR-1-G). Animals of the TR-G were orally administered with the aqueous extract at doses of 50 ml/kg b.w, from the day of BaP injection and of the TR-1-G, from the 120th day of injection, till death. L-1210 malignant cells in cultivation, were administered with a powder obtained by condensation and lyophilization of the extract, at various concentrations and cytotoxicity was measured by the microculture tetrazolium assay. Autopsy of the rats, revealed metastasis in the lungs of the animals of all groups and the tumors developed were histologically identified as leiomyosarcomas. The results indicated that the extract of the above plants possess anticarcinogenic effects, documented by: a) its antiproliferative effects on L-1210 cells (IC50 = 49.6 +/- 1.4 micrograms/ml), b) the significant prolongation of life and reduction of tumor growth rate of the animals of the TR-G in comparison to the C-G, c) the inhibition by 16.6% of tumor induction in the TR-G and d) the prolongation of life and the necrotic effects of the extract on the tumors of the animals in the TR-1-G. The antiproliferative effects of the Abies alba and Viscum album se abies extract may be due to the lectins and thionins contained in Viscum album, as well as to the monoterpenes contained in Abies alba. Soft tissue tumors sensitive to the extract, are widespread among human organs, even in larynx, and are usually resistant to chemotherapy.	abies alba leiomyosarcomas
1	Structures of new phenylbutanoids and nitric oxide production inhibitors from the rhizomes of Zingiber cassumunar.The methanolic (MeOH) extract from the rhizomes of Zingiber cassumunar showed nitric oxide (NO) production inhibitory effects induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mouse peritoneal macrophages. From the MeOH extract, six new phenylbutanoids, phlains I-VI, were isolated together with 16 known constituents. The structures of new phenylbutanoids were determined on the basis of physicochemical and chemical evidence. In addition, the inhibitory effects of the principal constituents on the NO production were examined. Among them, phlain III (IC50=24 microM), (E)-1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)buta-1,3-diene (69 microM), (E)-1-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)buta-1,3-diene (83 microM), and cassumunaquinone 1 (47 microM) were found to show the inhibitory effects.	zingiber cassumunar phlain iii
1	Anti-inflammatory terpenylated coumarins from the leaves of Zanthoxylum schinifolium with alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity.Nine terpenylated coumarins, namely 7-[(E)-3',7'-dimethyl-6'-oxo-2',7'-octadienyl]oxy-coumarin (1), schinilenol (2), schinindiol (3), collinin (4), 7-[(E)-7'-hydroxy-3',7'-dimethy-locta-2',5'-dienyloxy]-coumarin (5), 8-methoxyanisocoumarin (6), 7-(6'R-hydroxy-3',7'-dimethyl-2'E,7'-octadienyloxy)coumarin (7), (E)-4-methyl-6-(coumarin-7'-yloxy)hex-4-enal (8), and aurapten (9), along with a 4-quinolone alkaloid (10) and integrifoliodiol (11), were isolated from the leaves of Zanthoxylum schinifolium. Of the isolates, compounds 4 and 7 potentially inhibited NO production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophage RAW264.7 cells, with IC50 values of 5.9 +- 0.8 and 18.2 +- 1.8 muM, respectively. Furthermore, compounds 4 and 7 dose-dependently reduced the LPS-induced iNOS expression. Moreover, pre-incubation of cells with 4 and 7 significantly suppressed LPS-induced COX-2 protein expression. In addition, compounds 4, 7, 8, and 10 showed strong alpha-glucosidase inhibitory effects, with IC50 values of 92.1 +- 0.7, 90.6 +- 0.9, 78.2 +- 0.2, and 82.4 +- 0.8 muM, respectively. Compounds 1, 5, and 11 displayed moderate effects with IC50 values of 161.6 +- 0.3, 164.4 +- 1.1, and 155.4 +- 0.9 muM, while acarbose, a positive control, possessed an IC50 value of 121.5 +- 1.0 muM. This is the first investigation on the alpha-glucosidase inhibitory effect of components from Zanthoxylum schinifolium. Further studies should be made on active compounds.	zanthoxylum schinifolium coumarins
1	Antioxidant capacity and total phenolic contents in hydrophilic extracts of selected Bangladeshi medicinal plants.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate hydrophilic extracts from edible portions of fifteen plants for total phenolic content (TPC) and anti-oxidant capacity (AC) as an effort to find possible sources for future novel antioxidants. METHODS: Folin-Ciocalteau and DPPH radical scavenging assays were employed to determine TPC and AC, respectively. RESULTS: Among the assayed plants, TPC (mean+-SD), expressed as gallic acid equivalent, varied from 0.04+-0.01 (Amaranthus spinosus) to 6.01+-0.04 (Zanthoxylum rhetsa) mg gallic acid equivalent/g fresh weight. AC (mean+-SD), expressed as trolox equivalent, ranged from 0.14+-0.00 (Alternanthera philoxeroides) to 7.54+-0.00 (Zanthoxylum rhetsa) mumol trolox equivalent/g fresh weight. A significant and positive linear relationship (R(2)=0.99) was observed between TPC and AC of Zanthoxylum rhetsa, Oxalis corymbosa, and Alternanthera sessilis. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study implies that the analyzed plants possess varying degree of antioxidant capacity and, therefore, the antioxidant potency of these underused plants may be utilized to prevent oxidative damage and oxidative stress related disorders.	zanthoxylum rhetsa gallic acid
1	Authentication and quantitative analysis on the chemical profile of cassia bark (cortex cinnamomi) by high-pressure liquid chromatography.Cassia bark or cortex cinnamomi, the dried stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia Presl. (Lauraceae), is a popular natural spice and a commonly used herb in traditional Chinese medicine. However, adulterants are frequently found in the market. In this study, 44 samples of Cassia bark including bark from seven related Cinnamomum species were collected from fields and market. Four characteristic components, cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, and coumarin were determined by RP-HPLC, and a fingerprint comprised of five markers was established. These results showed that cassia barks contained high contents of cinnamaldehyde (13.01-56.93 mg/g). The highest content of cinnamaldehyde (up to 93.83 mg/g) was found in debarked cortex, which is traditionally regarded as having the best quality in local herb shops. In contrast, the adulterants from the other Cinnamomum species, C. wilsonii Camble, C. japonicum Sieb., C. mairei Levl. and C. burmanii (Nees) Blume, contained low contents of cinnamaldehyde (&lt;2.00 mg/g). The content of cinnamaldehyde in C. loureirii Nees was comparable to that in C. cassia. It is suggested that five characteristic peaks by HPLC are suitable for distinguishing genuine cassia bark from the adulterants and could be applied in the quality control of this commodity.	cassia bark cinnamyl alcohol
1	Simultaneous qualitative and quantitative analysis of triterpenic acids, saponins and flavonoids in the leaves of two Ziziphus species by HPLC-PDA-MS/ELSD.The leaves of Ziziphus jujuba and Z. jujuba var. spinosa have been utilized as crude drugs for their health benefits in China for thousands of years. To control their quality, a reliable method based on high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with photo diode array and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry detection (HPLC-PDA-ESI-MS/MS) was developed for exploration of the chemical profiles of these jujube leaves. As the results, fourteen constituents including three flavonoids, two saponins and nine triterpenic acids were identified or tentatively characterized. Then, twelve of them such as quercetin-3-O-rutinoside, zizyphus saponins I and II, ceanothic acid, alphitolic acid, maslinic acid, 2alpha-hydroxyursolic acid, zizyberanalic acid, epiceanothic acid, ceanothenic acid, betulinic acid, and oleanolic acid were selected as the chemical markers and were determined using an HPLC coupled with evaporative light scattering detection (ELSD) method. The separation was carried out on a Waters Sunfire C18 column with 0.2 % acetic acid and acetonitrile as the mobile phase under gradient elution. The operating conditions of ELSD were set as 80 C for drift tube temperature and 2.7 l/min for nitrogen flow rate. The developed method was fully validated in terms of linearity, sensitivity, precision, repeatability as well as recovery, and subsequently applied to evaluate the quality of eight batches of Z. jujuba and Z. jujuba var. spinosa leaves from different collections.	z. jujuba var flavonoids
1	Antimicrobial activities of cinnamon oil and cinnamaldehyde from the Chinese medicinal herb Cinnamomum cassia Blume.Both Cinnamomum verum J.S. Presl. and Cinnamomum cassia Blume are collectively called Cortex Cinnamonmi for their medicinal cinnamon bark. Cinnamomum verum is more popular elsewhere in the world, whereas C. cassia is a well known traditional Chinese medicine. An analysis of hydro-distilled Chinese cinnamon oil and pure cinnamaldehyde by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry revealed that cinnamaldehyde is the major component comprising 85% in the essential oil and the purity of cinnamaldehyde in use is high (&gt; 98%). Both oil and pure cinnamaldehyde of C. cassia were equally effective in inhibiting the growth of various isolates of bacteria including Gram-positive (1 isolate, Staphylococcus aureus), and Gram-negative (7 isolates, E. coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Samonella typhymurium), and fungi including yeasts (four species of Candida, C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, and C. krusei), filamentous molds (4 isolates, three Aspergillus spp. and one Fusarium sp.) and dermatophytes (three isolates, Microsporum gypseum, Trichophyton rubrum and T. mentagraphytes). Their minimum inhibition concentrations (MIC) as determined by agar dilution method varied only slightly. The MICs of both oil and cinnamaldehyde for bacteria ranged from 75 microg/ml to 600 microg/ml, for yeasts from 100 microg/ml to 450 microg/ml, for filamentous fungi from 75 microg/ml to 150 microg/ml, and for dermatophytes from 18.8 microg/ml to 37.5 microg/ml. The antimicrobial effectiveness of C. cassia oil and its major constituent is comparable and almost equivalent, which suggests that the broad-spectrum antibiotic activities of C. cassia oil are due to cinnamaldehyde. The relationship between structure and function of the main components of cinnamon oil is also discussed.	c. cassia cinnamaldehyde
3	Hypoglycemic effects of three Iranian edible plants; jujube, barberry and saffron: Correlation with serum adiponectin level.One of the most common disorders of the endocrine system is diabetes mellitus. This disease is associated with dyslipidemia. Adiponectin is a protein hormone that secreted by adipocytes and has an important role in regulating of glucose and fatty acid metabolic pathways. This study was designed to investigate the changes in serum level of adiponectin in diabetic rats treated with hydroalcoholic extracts of three medicinal plants; jujube (Ziziphus jujuba), barberry (Berberis vulgaris) and saffron (Crocus sativus) in comparison with quercetin. Streptozotocin -induced diabetic male rats were gavaged with specified doses of the extracts (25 and 100mg/kg) for two weeks. At the end of treatment period, fasting blood specimens were collected. The levels of adiponectin, fasting blood sugar (FBS), total Cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-C and LDL-C were measured. Statistical analysis showed that serum levels of triglyceride and VLDL decreased significantly (P&lt;0.05) in all treated groups. FBS level in all treated groups, decreased significantly and reach to normoglycemic level (P&lt;0.05). Except Jujube, other plant extracts had no effect on cholesterol. Jujube in two doses (25 and 100mg/kg) could increased significantly HDL-C (P&lt;0.05) with no effect on total cholesterol and LDL-C. Serum adiponectin level increased in all treated groups. These beneficial effects of C. sativus, B. vulgaris and Z. jujube extracts and quercetin in diabetic rats may be associated with increase in adiponectin level. 	quercetin diabetic
1	Four new phenolic glycosides from Baoyuan decoction.Four new phenolic glycosides, including two flavonoid glycosides (1 and 2) and two lignan glycosides (3 and 4), were isolated from the traditional Chinese medicine formula, Baoyuan decoction. Their structures were established by detailed analysis of the NMR and HR-ESI-MS spectroscopic data and their absolute configurations were determined by the experimental electronic circular dichroism data as well as chemical methods. Furthermore, the sources of the four new compounds were determined by the UPLC-Qtrap-MS method, which proved that 1 and 2 are originated from Glycyrrhiza uralensis, and 3 and 4 are from Cinnamomum cassia.	glycyrrhiza uralensis flavonoid glycosides
1	Protective Effect of Selected Medicinal Plants against Hydrogen Peroxide Induced Oxidative Damage on Biological Substrates.Oxidative stress is developed due to susceptibility of biological substrates to oxidation by generation of free radicals. In degenerative diseases, oxidative stress level can be reduced by antioxidants which neutralize free radicals. Primary objective of this work was to screen four medicinal plants, namely, Andrographis paniculata, Costus speciosus, Canthium parviflorum, and Abrus precatorius, for their antioxidant property using two biological substrates-RBC and microsomes. The antioxidative ability of three solvent extracts, methanol (100% and 80%) and aqueous leaf extracts, was studied at different concentrations by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances method using Fenton's reagent to induce oxidation in the substrates. The polyphenol and flavonoid content were analyzed to relate with the observed antioxidant effect of the extracts. The phytochemical screening indicated the presence of flavonoids, polyphenols, tannins, and beta-carotene in the samples. In microsomes, 80% methanol extract of Canthium and Costus and, in RBC, 80% methanol extract of Costus showed highest inhibition of oxidation and correlated well with the polyphenol and flavonoid content. From the results it can be concluded that antioxidants from medicinal plants are capable of inhibiting oxidation in biological systems, suggesting scope for their use as nutraceuticals. 	abrus precatorius polyphenol
2	Active compound of Zingiber cassumunar Roxb. down-regulates the expression of genes involved in joint erosion in a human synovial fibroblast cell line.Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the synovium. It is involved in up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), resulting in joint inflammation and erosion. Zingiber cassumunar Roxb. has long been used to reduce joint pain and inflammation. This study aimed to investigate the inhibitory activities of an active compound of Z. cassumunar, (E)-4-(3',4'-dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-en-1-ol (compound D), against cytokine-induced up-regulation of catabolic genes involved in cartilage degradation in RA. Synovial fibroblast cell line, SW982, was cultured in media containing interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), in the presence or absence of compound D at the concentration range of 1 to 100 microM. After 24 hours, the cells were analyzed for the expressions of MMPs, IL-1beta and interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme (ICE) by RT-PCR. MMPs activities in the culture media were analyzed by zymographic techniques. Dexamethasone was used as the positive control. It was found that compound D at the concentration of 10 - 100 microM significantly decreased the mRNA expressions of MMP-1, -2, -3, and -13 which was induced by IL-1beta (P&lt;0.05) concomitantly with a decrease in activities of these MMPs in the culture media. An increase in the mRNA expression of IL-1beta and ICE was also suppressed by compound D. The results suggest that the potent activities of this compound may be involved in the reduction of IL-1beta protein synthesis in both pro-form and active form which played an important role in up-regulation of MMPs. This study first revealed the chondroprotective activity of Z. cassumunar in the transcriptional level by suppressing cytokine-induced catabolic genes which caused cartilage erosion in RA. 	z. cassumunar RA
1	Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitory phenylbutenoids from the rhizomes of Zingiber cassumunar.Phenylbutenoids isolated previously from the CHCl3 extracts of the rhizomes of Zingiber cassumunar, were evaluated for their cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitory activity along with a new isolate, from the n-BuOH extracts of this plant. The COX-2 inhibitory assay was performed by measuring prostaglandin E2 production in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 cells. Two phenylbutenoid dimers, and, exhibited considerable activity with IC50 values of 2.71 and 3.64 microM. Two phenylbutenoid monomers, and, showed moderate activity (IC50 14.97, 20.68 microM, respectively). The other three phenylbutenoids, were found to be inactive. Compound was elucidated as a new phenylbutenoid glycoside, namely, (E)-4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-en-1-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside by spectral analysis including various 1D- and 2D-NMR experiments.	zingiber cassumunar phenylbutenoids
0	Methyl cinnamate inhibits adipocyte differentiation via activation of the CaMKK2-AMPK pathway in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes.Methyl cinnamate, an active component of  Zanthoxylum armatum , is a widely used natural flavor compound with antimicrobial and tyrosinase inhibitor activities. However, the underlying bioactivity and molecular mechanisms of methyl cinnamate on adipocyte function and metabolism remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effect of methyl cinnamate on adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Methyl cinnamate markedly suppressed triglyceride accumulation associated with down-regulation of adipogenic transcription factor expression, including sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha). Additionally, methyl cinnamate-inhibited PPARgamma activity and adipocyte differentiation were partially reversed by the PPARgamma agonist troglitazone. Furthermore, methyl cinnamate stimulated Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CaMKK2) and phospho-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) expression during adipogenesis. This study first revealed methyl cinnamate has antiadipogenic activity through mechanisms mediated, in part, by the CaMKK2-AMPK signaling pathway in 3T3-L1 cells.	methyl cinnamate CaMKK2
2	Evaluation of Abelmoschus moschatus extracts for antioxidant, free radical scavenging, antimicrobial and antiproliferative activities using in vitro assays.BACKGROUND: Abelmoschus moschatus Medik. leaves and seeds are considered as valuable traditional medicine. The aromatic seeds of this plant are aphrodisiac, ophthalmic, cardio tonic, antispasmodic and used in the treatment of intestinal complaints and check queasiness. To give a scientific basis for traditional usage of this medicinal plant, the seed and leaf extracts were evaluated for their antioxidant, free radical scavenging, antimicrobial and antiproliferative activities. METHODS: In this study, antioxidant, antimicrobial and antiproliferative activities of A. moschatus extracts were evaluated in a series of in vitro assay involving free radicals, reactive oxygen species and their IC50 values were also determined. The antioxidant activities of the seed and leaf extracts of A. moschatus were determined by total antioxidant, DPPH, and ferrous reducing antioxidant property (FRAP) methods. In addition, the antiproliferative activity was also evaluated using colorectal adenocarcinoma and retinoblastoma human cancer cell lines. Moreover, six bacterial reference strains, two gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus), four gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris and Salmonella enterica paratyphi) and one fungal strain (Candida albicans) were used to evaluate its antimicrobial activity. RESULTS: The results from this study showed that the antioxidant activities of A. moschatus as determined by the total phenol, flavonoids, total antioxidant and FRAP methods were higher in leaf than that of the seed extracts. On the other hand, the aqueous overnight seed extract (AMS-I) has shown significant radical scavenging activity as in 1, 1- Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical, superoxide and lipid peroxidation as compared to other seed and leaf extracts. The AMS-I and AML-IV have shown activity against six and seven microorganisms respectively. Simulteneously, AMS-IV and AML-IV have demonstrated potential antiproliferative activity against two human cell lines - Colorectal adenocarcinoma (COLO-205) and retinoblastoma (Y79). CONCLUSION: The seed and leaf extracts of A. moschatus possess significant antioxidant activity and could serve as free radical inhibitors or scavenger, or substitute, probably as primary antioxidants. The plant possesses moderate antibacterial activity against bacterial strains used in this study. Hydroalcoholic seed and leaf extracts also exhibited antiproliferative activity against two human cancer cell lines. A. moschatus may therefore, be a good candidate for functional foods as well as pharmaceutics.	a. moschatus retinoblastoma
1	Structure-activity relationship of benzophenanthridine alkaloids from Zanthoxylum rhoifolium having antimicrobial activity.Zanthoxylum rhoifolium (Rutaceae) is a plant alkaloid that grows in South America and has been used in Brazilian traditional medicine for the treatment of different health problems. The present study was designed to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the steam bark crude methanol extract, fractions, and pure alkaloids of Z. rhoifolium. Its stem bark extracts exhibited a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, ranging from 12.5 to 100 microg/mL using bioautography method, and from 125 to 500 microg/mL in the microdilution bioassay. From the dichloromethane basic fraction, three furoquinoline alkaloids (1-3), and nine benzophenanthridine alkaloids (4-12) were isolated and the antimicrobial activity of the benzophenanthridine alkaloids is discussed in terms of structure-activity relationships. The alkaloid with the widest spectrum of activity was chelerythrine (10), followed by avicine (12) and dihydrochelerythrine (4). The minimal inhibitory concentrations of chelerythrine, of 1.50 microg/mL for all bacteria tested, and between 3.12 and 6.25 microg/mL for the yeast tested, show this compound to be a more powerful antimicrobial agent when compared with the other active alkaloids isolated from Z. rhoifolium. To verify the potential importance of the methylenedioxy group (ring A) of these alkaloids, chelerythrine was selected to represent the remainder of the benzophenanthridine alkaloids isolated in this work and was subjected to a demethylation reaction giving derivative 14. Compared to chelerythrine, the derivative (14) was less active against the tested bacteria and fungi. Kinetic measurements of the bacteriolytic activities of chelerythrine against the bacteria Bacillus subtilis (Gram-positive) and Escherichia coli (Gram-negative) were determined by optical density based on real time assay, suggesting that its mechanism of action is not bacteriolytic. The present study did not detect hemolytic effects of chelerythrine on erythrocytes and found a protective effect considering the decrease in TBARS and AOPP (advanced oxidized protein products) levels when compared to the control group. 	z. rhoifolium chelerythrine
1	Investigation of in vivo metabolic profile of Abelmoschus Manihot based on pattern recognition analysis.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Abelmoschus manihot (L.) Medik. var. manihot is one of the most commonly used Chinese medicines and has played an important role in treating chronic glomerulonephritis and diabetic nephropathy. AIM OF THE STUDY: Metabolites identification of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a complex and time-consuming process due to the complicity of TCM and subsequent large number of detected ions. In this paper, UPLC-MS combined with pattern recognition analysis approach were used to simplify and quicken the identification of the metabolites of Abelmoschus Manihot. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rat urine samples were collected before (as control sample) and after Abelmoschus Manihot administration. Pattern recognition analysis method was used to differentiate components between Abelmoschus Manihot-treated group and its controlled comparison. These components could be considered as Abelmoschus Manihot-related metabolites in vivo. RESULTS: LC-MS based metabolomics could be an advanced tool to help us find metabolites with regards to its capacity of processing large datasets, differentiating and classifying of sample groups, as well as its indiscriminative nature of biomarker and metabolite identification. Using this method, seven metabolites were identified, which are flavonoid aglycone glucuronidation, sulfatation, and methylation metabolites. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that UPLC-MS based- pattern recognition analysis approach can be used to quickly identify Abelmoschus Manihot related metabolites in biological fluids. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the potential application of combining the UPLC-MS approach with the metabolomics approach in identifying the metabolites of TCM.	abelmoschus manihot flavonoid
1	Mast cell stabilizing and antiallergic activity of Abrus precatorius in the management of asthma.OBJECTIVE: To investigate effects of ethanol extract of Abrus precatorius leaves (EAPL) on egg albumin induced mast cell degranulation in mice and passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in rats.

1	Identification of marker compounds for Japanese Pharmacopoeia non-conforming jujube seeds from Myanmar.Jujube seed is a crude drug defined as the seed of Ziziphus jujuba Miller var. spinosa Hu ex H.F. Chou (Rhamnaceae) in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia (JP). Most of the jujube seed in the Japanese markets is imported from China, with the rest obtained from other Asian countries. Here we confirmed the botanical origins of jujube seeds from both China and Myanmar by a DNA sequencing analysis. We found that the botanical origins of the crude drugs from China and Myanmar were Z. jujuba and Z. mauritiana, respectively. Although the jujube seed from China conforms to the JP, that from Myanmar does not. A method for discriminating jujube seeds from China and Myanmar using a chemical approach is thus desirable, and here we sought to identify a compound specific to Z. jujuba. Jujuboside A (1) was identified as a compound specific to Z. jujuba. To establish a purity test of Jujube Seed in the JP against Z. mauritiana, we fractionated the extract of Z. mauritiana seeds and identified frangufoline (2) and oleanolic acid (4) as the marker compounds specific to Z. mauritiana. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses revealed that the latter compound was useful for testing by TLC analysis. The established TLC conditions were as follows: chromatographic support, silica gel; developing solvent, n-hexane:EtOAc:HCOOH = 10:5:1; developing length, 7 cm; visualization, diluted sulfuric acid; R f value, 0.43 (oleanolic acid).	z. mauritiana oleanolic acid
2	In vitro anti-Helicobacter pylori action of 30 Chinese herbal medicines used to treat ulcer diseases.Infection by Helicobacter pylori has been ascertained to be an important etiologic impetus leading usually to chronic active gastritis and gastric ulcer with growing incidences worldwide. Utilizing as the test pathogen a standard and five clinic strains of Helicobacter pylori, the antibacterial action was assessed in vitro with ethanol extracts of 30 Chinese herbal medicines which have been frequently prescribed since ancient times for treating gastritis-like disorders. Among the 30 tested materials, the ethanol extracts of Abrus cantoniensis (Fabaceae), Saussurea lappa (Asteraceae) and Eugenia caryophyllata (Myrtaceae) were strongly inhibitory to all test strains (MICs: approximately 40 microg/ml), and Hippophae rhamnoides (Elaeagnaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii (Liliaceae), Magnolia officinalis and Schisandra chinensis (Magnoliaceae), Corydalis yanhusuo (Papaveraceae), Citrus reticulata (Rutaceae), Bupleurum chinense and Ligusticum chuanxiong (Apiaceae) substantially active with MICs close to 60.0 microg/ml. As to antibacterial actions of the aqueous extracts of the same drugs, those derived from Cassia obtusifolia (Fabaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii and Eugenia caryophyllata were remarkably inhibitory against all the six Helicobacter pylori strains (MICs: approximately 60 microg/ml). The work compared almost quantitatively the magnitude of the anti-Helicobacter pylori actions of the 30 most prescribed gastritis-treating Chinese herbal drugs, and located as well some source plants where potent anti-Helicobacter pylori phytochemicals could be characterized.	eugenia caryophyllata ulcer diseases
2	Antitumour effect of abrin on transplanted tumours in mice.Abrin, a galactose specific lectin was purified using sepharose 4B affinity column from seeds of Abrus precatorius. It exhibited antitumour activity in mice when used at a sublethal dose of 7.5 micrograms/kg every alternate day for 10 days. Both intralesional and intraperiloneal (i.p.) administration of abrin was effective in reducing solid tumour mass development induced by Dalton's Lymphoma Ascites (DLA) and Ehrlich's Ascites Carcinoma (EAC) cells. DLA cell line was more sensitive to abrin than EAC. Abrin when injected i.p. increased the life span of ascites tumour bearing mice. Abrin when used simultaneously with tumour cells brought about maximum antitumour effect. On developed tumour masses, abrin administration brought about significant reduction in tumour volume, especially in DLA induced tumours. Prophylactic administration of abrin was found ineffective.	abrus precatorius ehrlich's ascites carcinoma
2	Protective effects of Cinnamomum cassia Blume in the fibrogenesis of activated HSC-T6 cells and dimethylnitrosamine-induced acute liver injury in SD rats.Cinnamomum cassia Blume (CC) is one of the world's oldest natural spices, and is commonly used in traditional oriental medicine. We investigated the protective effect of ethanol extract from Cinnamomum cassia Blume (CCE) on the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). In addition, we examined the effects of CC powder in Sprague-Dawley rats with acute liver injury induced by dimethylnitrosamine (DMN). In vitro, HSC-T6 cells exhibit an activated phenotype, as reflected in their fibroblast-like morphology. CCE significantly reduced the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta1), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1). In vivo, the results were significantly protected by CC powder in the serum total protein, albumin, total-bilirubin, direct-bilirubin, glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). We suggest that CC inhibits fibrogenesis, followed by HSC-T6 cell activation and increased restoration of liver function, ultimately resulting in acute liver injury.	cinnamomum cassia liver injury
1	Antitrypanosomal isoflavan quinones from Abrus precatorius.Human African trypanosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease in sub Saharan Africa that is fatal if left untreated. In a search for new natural products with antitrypanosomal activity, we recently identified abruquinones B and I from Abrus precatorius as potent in vitro trypanocidal compounds with high selectivity indices. To obtain sufficient compound for in vivo efficacy tests in mice, a second batch of plant material was re-collected and extracted. However, the chemical profiles of the two batches differed, and additional abruquinones were isolated and identified by HR-ESI-MS, and 1D and 2D NMR ((1)H, (13)C, COSY, HMBC, HSQC, and NOESY) spectroscopy. Abruquinones J (1), K (2), and L (3) were new, while abruquinones A (4) and D (5) were known from the first batch of plant material. The absolute configuration of compounds 1 to 3 was determined by comparison of electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra with calculated ECD data. Compounds 2 to 5 showed high in vitro activity against T. b. rhodesiense (IC50 of 0.01, 0.02, 0.02 and 0.01 muM, respectively), and remarkable SIs of 508, 374, 1379, and 668, respectively.	abrus precatorius abruquinones j
1	UHPLC-TOFMS coupled with chemometric method as a powerful technique for rapid exploring of differentiating components between two Ziziphus species.To rapidly explore the differentiating components and the potential chemical markers for discrimination between those Chinese medicinal herbs with similar chemical characteristics, an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-TOFMS coupled with multivariate statistical analysis method was proposed and validated by using two Ziziphus species (Z. jujuba and Z. jujuba var. spinosa) as the model herbs. After the samples were analyzed using UHPLC-TOFMS, the data sets of retention time (RT)-m/z pairs, ion intensities and sample codes were further processed with orthogonal partial least squared discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) to holistically compare the difference between the fruits of these two Ziziphus species, and to generate an S-plot. Those compounds correlating to the points at the two ends of "S" were regarded as the most differentiating components between these two kinds of samples. By comparing the mass/UV spectra and retention times with those of reference compounds, these components were finally characterized as zizyberenalic acid, palmitoleic acid, oleic acid, pomonic acid and rutin, and these compounds would be the potential chemical markers for discrimination of these jujube products. The results suggested that this newly established approach could be used to rapidly determine the subtle differences and explore the potential chemical markers for differentiation within the herbs with similar chemical ingredients.	jujube rutin
2	Aromatic and Aliphatic Apiuronides from the Bark of Cinnamomum cassia.Cinnamomum cassia Presl (Cinnamon) has been widely cultivated in the tropical or subtropical areas, such as Yunnan, Fujian, Guandong, and Hainan in China, as well as India, Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia. Four new glycosides bearing apiuronic acid (1, 4, 6, and 7) and their sodium or potassium salts (2, 3, and 5), together with 31 known compounds, were isolated from a hot water extract of the bark of C. cassia via repeated chromatography. The structures of the new compounds (1-7) were determined by NMR, IR, MS, and ICP-AES data and by acid hydrolysis and sugar analysis. This is the first report of the presence of apiuronic acid glycosides. Some of the isolates were evaluated for their analgesic effects on a neuropathic pain animal model induced by paclitaxel. Cinnzeylanol (8), cinnacaside (9), kelampayoside A (10), and syringaresinol (11) showed analgesic effects against paclitaxel-induced cold allodynia.	c. cassia neuropathic pain
2	A comparative antibacterial evaluation of raw and processed Gunja (Abrus precatorius Linn.) seeds.BACKGROUND: Seed of Gunja (Abrus precatorius Linn.), a known poisonous drug, is used extensively in various ayurvedic formulations with great therapeutic significance. Ayurveda recommends the administration of Gunja in diseases like Indralupta (alopecia), Sotha (edema), Krmi (helminthes), Kustha (skin diseases), Kandu (itching), Prameha (urinary disorders) etc., after being treated with specific Sodhana (purification) procedures. OBJECTIVE: To assess the antimicrobial action of of raw and Shodhita (Processed) Gunja seeds. METHODS: Gunja seeds after being processed with Godugdha (cow's milk), Nimbu swarasa (Lemon juice), Kanji (Sour gruel) and water, as the media, were evaluated for its antibacterial effect against clinically important bacterial strains using agar well diffusion method. RESULTS: Aqueous extracts of raw seeds of Gunja exert its antibacterial effect on both Gram positive, as well as Gram negative bacteria but none of the Sodhita Gunja seeds showed any bactericidal effect on any bacterial strains. Chloroform extracts of all the Sodhita Gunja seed extracts could inhibit bacterial growth but with variations. CONCLUSION: The study displayed that chloroform extracts of raw and sodhita samples for bacterial study were much sensitive than the aqueous extracts.	abrus precatorius skin diseases
3	In vitro inhibition of dengue virus entry by p-sulfoxy-cinnamic acid and structurally related combinatorial chemistries.The anti-adhesive compound p-sulfoxy-cinnamic acid, zosteric acid (ZA), is derived from the temperate marine eelgrass, Zostera marina. ZA and five combinatorial chemistries based on ZA were evaluated for their anti-viral properties against dengue virus in a focus forming unit reduction assay. None of the compounds showed evidence of toxicity to the monkey kidney cell line LLCMK-2 over the concentration ranges tested. ZA showed a modest IC(50) of approximately 2.3 mM against DENV-2. Three other compounds showed IC(50) values of 2.5, 2.4, 0.3 mM, with a fourth not achieving a 50% inhibitory concentration against DENV-2. The most active compound, CF 238, showed IC(50) values of 24, 46, 14 and 47 microM against DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4, respectively. CF 238 showed evidence of inhibition at an entry step in the viral life cycle and enhanced virus:cell binding as evidenced by a quantitative RT-PCR assay system. CF 238 may promote inappropriate virus:cell attachments common to all DENV strains that interfere with receptor interactions required for viral entry. These and other related chemistries may be useful as reagents for studying DENV entry, capturing and detecting DENV, and development of pharmaceuticals.	p-sulfoxy-cinnamic acid toxicity
1	Efficacy of a polyphenolic extract from silver fir (Abies alba) bark on psoriasis: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.Silver fir (Abies alba) bark extract contains a mixture of bioactive polyphenols. We tested their effectiveness in the treatment of psoriasis in order to further investigate the potential topical anti-inflammatory activity of polyphenols by means of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled add-on clinical trial, after having examined their ability to downregulate the expression of IL-1beta cytokine in monocyte/macrophage primary cell culture. 61 patients with mild psoriasis met the inclusion criteria and were willing to comply with protocol requirements, were enrolled in the study. The severity of the disease was measured by psoriasis area severity index (PASI). Treatment efficacy was evaluated by assessing erythema (E, 0 to 4-point scale), desquamation (D, 0 to 4-point scale) and induration (I, 0 to 4-point scale) of lesions before and after the treatment. All patients enrolled in the study had symmetrical psoriasis plaques on the skin. All patients received O/V ointment with 2% of silver fir bark extract and/or placebo, respectively. We compared medications by right/left intra-patient comparison, so that the control group was always contralateral of the tested one. Location of the tested or control site was randomised, using a computer-generated randomisation schedule. Silver fir extract was well-tolerated. A superiority of active treatment above placebo, based on the clinical investigational PASI score system was observed by 15 % in all volunteers and in 40% regarding the improvement of psoriasis on elbows. However, statistical analysis showed no significant differences between placebo and active treatment with the extract from silver fir bark (p &lt; 0.05).	silver fir polyphenols
3	Cytotoxic lignan esters from Cinnamomum osmophloeum.The bark and roots of Cinnamomum osmophloeum are widely used in Taiwan as spice substitutes for C. CASSIA. We have isolated three novel lignan esters, one dibenzylbutane-type ligan ester [9,9'-di-O-feruloyl-(+)-5,5'-dimethoxy secoisolariciresinol (3)] and two cyclolignan esters [(7' S,8' R,8 R) -lyoniresinol-9-O-(E)-feruloyl ester ( 5) and (7' S,8' R,8 R)-lyoniresinol-9,9'-di-O-(E)-feruloyl ester (6)], and several known lignans from the heartwood and roots of C. osmophloeum. We identified these compounds using 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Cytotoxicity assays of these novel lignan esters revealed that compound 6 has strong activities against human liver cancer (HepG2 and Hep3B) and oral cancer (Ca9-22) cells, with IC(50) values of 7.87, 4.31, and 2.51 microg/mL, respectively.	lignan esters liver cancer
1	Memory-enhancing effect of a supercritical carbon dioxide fluid extract of the needles of Abies koreana on scopolamine-induced amnesia in mice.Abies koreana Wilson (A. koreana) is a shrub or broadly pyramidal evergreen tree endemic in the mountainous regions of South Korea. We obtained the essential oil (EO) from alpine needle leaves of A. koreana by the supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) method. EO was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and 68 compounds were identified constituting 95.66% of the oil. The major components were elemol (11.17%), terpinen-4-ol (9.77%), sabinene (8.86%), 10(15)-cadien-4-ol (7.16%), alpha-terpineol (6.13%), alpha-pinene (6.07%) and gamma-terpinene (4.71%). To investigate the memory-enhancing effects, we conducted a passive avoidance test using a scopolamine (1 mg/kg, ip)-induced amnesia mouse model. A peritoneal injection of EO from A. koreana (100 mg/kg) showed a memory enhancing effect of 72.7% compared with the control. These results suggest that EO of A. koreana may be a useful therapeutic agent against such amnesia-inducing diseases as Alzheimer and vascular dementia.	a. koreana essential oil
1	Dermal pharmacokinetics of Terpinen-4-ol following topical administration of Zingiber cassumunar (plai) oil.The purpose of this study was to investigate dermal pharmacokinetics of terpinen-4-ol in rats following topical administration of plai oil derived from the rhizomes of Zingiber cassumunar Roxb. Unbound terpinen-4-ol concentrations in dermal tissue were measured by microdialysis. The dermal pharmacokinetic study of terpinen-4-ol was performed under non-occlusive conditions. The oil was topically applied at a dose of 2, 4, and 8 mg/cm2 plai oil corresponding to the amount of 1.0, 1.9, and 3.8 mg/cm2 terpinen-4-ol, respectively. Following topical application of the oil, terpinen-4-ol rapidly distributed into the dermis and demonstrated linear pharmacokinetics with no changes in the dose-normalized area under the concentration-time curves across the investigated dosage range. The mean percentages of free terpinen-4-ol distributed in the dermis per amount of administered were 0.39 +- 0.06 %, 0.41 +- 0.08 %, and 0.30 +- 0.03 % for 2, 4, and 8 mg/cm2 doses, respectively. The dermal pharmacokinetics of terpinen-4-ol could provide information for its further formulation development and therapy schedules.	zingiber cassumunar roxb terpinen-4-ol
3	Protective effect of total flavones of Abelmoschus manihot L. Medic against poststroke depression injury in mice and its action mechanism.Total flavones of Abelmoschus manihot L. Medic (TFA) is the major active component isolated from the traditional Chinese herb Abelmoschus manihot L. Medic. We investigated the protective effect of TFA against poststroke depression (PSD) injury in mice and its action mechanism. A mouse model of PSD was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MACO) 30 min/reperfusion, followed by isolation feeding and chronic unpredictable mild stress for 2 weeks. Treatment groups received TFA at three different doses (160, 80, and 40 mg/kg, p.o.) or fluoxetine (Flu, 2.5 mg/kg, p.o.) daily for 24 days. Change in behavior, brain tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were measured. The expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was detected by immunohistochemistry, and mRNA expression of BDNF and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Treatment with TFA (160, 80, and 40 mg/kg) significantly ameliorated mice escape-directed behavioral impairment induced by PSD, markedly reduced MDA levels, and increased the activity of SOD, GSH-Px close to normal levels. TFA administration also attenuated PSD-induced neuronal death/losses, upregulated expression of BDNF both at mRNA and protein levels, as well as CREB mRNA levels. TFA had a protective effect against PSD injury in mice. Cardioprotection involves the inhibition of lipid peroxidation and upregulation of BDNF-CREB levels in the hippocampus, which may also be important mechanism of its antidepressants. This potential protection makes TFA a promising therapeutic agent for the PSD.	TFA poststroke depression (psd) injury
2	Clinical effects of Zingiber cassumunar (Plai): A systematic review.Zingiber cassumunar Roxb. known locally as "Plai" in Thai, has been used for treating bruise, sprain and musculoskeletal pain. Several pre-clinical studies demonstrated the anti-inflammatory effect of Plai. However, current evidence of clinical effects of Plai is still unclear. This study aimed to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of Plai among all identified indications. Of the 808 articles identified by a systematic review, six studies were included. Four studies were randomized controlled trials, while two studies were quasi-experimental studies involving 178 patients in intervention group and 177 patients in control group. Duration of treatment ranged from 7days to 2 months. Our findings showed that 14% Plai cream had a strong trend of benefits in pain reduction for muscle pain and ankle sprain. However, evidence supporting the effects of Plai on acne vulgaris treatment and anti-histamine effect are still unclear.	zingiber cassumunar roxb musculoskeletal pain
2	Comparison of the sedative and hypnotic effects of flavonoids, saponins, and polysaccharides extracted from Semen Ziziphus jujube.Semen Ziziphus jujube (SZJ), the seeds of Ziziphus jujuba Mill. var. spinosa, is a kind of traditional Chinese medicine used for its action on insomnia. In order to analyze the effective component, we investigated and compared the sedative and hypnotic effects of three kinds of compounds, flavonoids, saponins, and polysaccharides. Flavonoids, saponins, and polysaccharides were extracted from SZJ and orally administered to mice separately at 17 g kg(-1) per day for certain days before animal tests. Spontaneous motility and coordinated movement tests were used to observe the effects of the three kinds of compounds on the mouse behavior, and sodium barbital-induced sleeping time of mouse were tested to analyze the effects of the three kinds of compounds on the sleep of mouse. Results show that flavonoids and saponins caused a significant reduction of walking time and coordinated movement ability of mouse, significantly prolonged its sleeping time at 40 mg kg(-1), ip, subthreshold dose and increased the sleeping number of animals at 50 mg kg(-1), ip, superthreshold dose induced by coeliac injection of sodium barbital. Polysaccharides did not show any significance in all animal tests. Comparative analysis showed that saponins had a more effective sedative and hypnotic function than that of flavonoids, polysaccharides did not show a sedative and hypnotic effect.	ziziphus jujuba mill. var insomnia
3	Cytotoxic mannopyranosides of indole alkaloids from Zanthoxylum nitidum.Three new mannopyranosides of indole alkaloids, methyl 7-(beta-D-mannopyranosyloxy)-1H-indole-2-carboxylate (1), methyl 7-[(3-O-acetyl-beta-D-mannopyranosyl)oxy]-1H-indole-2-carboxylate (2), and 2-methyl-1H-indol-7-yl beta-D-mannopyranoside (3), were isolated from an EtOH extract of the roots of Zanthoxylum nitidum. Their structures were identified as new compounds on the basis of the spectroscopic analyses. Bioactivity evaluation revealed that these alkaloids possess significant cytotoxicities against all the tested tumor cell lines with IC50 values of less than 30 muM. 	alkaloids tumor
1	Measurement of plasma procyanidin B-2 and procyanidin B-3 levels after oral administration in rat.Using a high-performance liquid chromatographic method and mass spectrometry analysis, we successfully measured the absorption of orally administered procyanidin B-2 and procyanidin B-3 isolated from Cinnamonomi cortex (the bark of Cinnamomum cassia Blume) in the rat plasma. This method used a TSK- GEL ODS-80TS column, two solvents (A: 0.01% acetic acid; B: methanol with 0.01% acetic acid) in a linear gradient at a flow-rate of 1.0 ml/min, and fluorescence detection at excitation and emission wavelengths of 220 and 327 nm.	cinnamomum cassia procyanidin b-2

CONCLUSION: Compound 1 is a new compound named jujuboside D, 4 is reported as rotamer for the first time, 3 and 5 isolated from this plant for the first time.	ziziphus jujuba mill var jujuboside d
2	Cellular mechanisms underlying Hyperin-induced relaxation of rat basilar artery.BACKGROUND AND AIM: Hyperin, a flavonol compound extracted from the Chinese herb Abelmoschus manihot L. Medic, is reported to exert protective actions in cerebral ischemic injury. The specific aim of the present study was to study the relaxation of Hyperin in rat isolated basilar artery and identify the underlying cellular mechanisms. METHODS: Rat isolated basilar artery segments were cannulated and perfused while being superfused with PSS solution. Vessel images were recorded by video microscopy and diameters measured. Membrane potential was recorded using glass microelectrodes to evaluate the basilar artery smooth muscle cell hyperpolarization. RESULTS: Perfusion of Hyperin (1~100 muM) elicited a concentration-dependent relaxation of basilar artery segments preconstricted with 0.1 muM U46619. The response was significantly inhibited by the removal of the endothelium. Hyperin also elicited marked and concentration-dependent hyperpolarization of smooth muscle cells. 30 muM nitro-L-arginine (an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase) and indomethacin (an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase), partially inhibited Hyperin-induced relaxation and hyperpolarization leaving an attenuated, but significant, endothelium-dependent relaxation and hyperpolarization. This remaining effect was almost completely blocked by 1mM tetraethylammonium (an inhibitor of Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels), or by 100 muM DL-propargylglycine, an inhibitor of cystathionine-gamma-lyase (a synthase of the endogenous H(2)S). CONCLUSION: These findings show that Hyperin produces significant hyperpolarization in rat basilar artery smooth muscle cells and relaxation through both endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent mechanisms. The underlying mechanisms appeared to be multi-factorial involving nitric oxide, prostacyclin, and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF). Our data further suggest that endogenous H(2)S is a component of the EDHF-mediated hyperpolarization and relaxation to Hyperin.	abelmoschus manihot cerebral ischemic injury
2	Inhibitory effect of Zanthoxylum schinifolium on vascular smooth muscle proliferation.The proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells may perform a crucial role in the pathogenesis of vascular dysfunction such as atherosclerosis. The principal objective of this study was to determine the inhibitory effects of ethanol extract from Zanthoxylum schinifolium (EZS) on human aortic smooth muscle cell (HASMC) proliferation induced by TNF-alpha. The invasion and migration of HASMC was significantly promoted by treatment with TNF-alpha as compared with control. However, EZS inhibited the TNF-alpha-induced invasion and migration in a dose-dependent manner (p &lt; 0.01). [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation was also significantly inhibited by EZS treatment. We utilized western blotting analysis to evaluate the effects of EZS on cell cycle regulatory proteins. TNF-alpha induced the expression of CDK2/CDK4, and reduced the expression of p21(waf1/cip1)/p27(kip1). However, EZS also attenuated the expression of TNF-alpha-induced cell cycle regulatory proteins. The results of gelatin zymography demonstrated that the TNF-alpha-treated HASMC secreted gelatinases, probably including MMP-9, which may be involved in the invasion and migration of HASMC. EZS inhibited the production of TNF-alpha-induced formation of DCF-sensitive intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Our results showed that EZS exerts inhibitory effects on TNF-alpha-induced HASMC proliferation and migration, including the inhibition of MMP-9 activity and the down-regulation of ROS/production, thereby suggesting that EZS may be a possible therapeutic approach to the inhibition of atherosclerosis.	zanthoxylum schinifolium vascular dysfunction
3	Total flavone of Abelmoschl manihot L. medic exhibits protective effect against hind-limb ischemia in rat model.Total flavones of Abelmoschus manihot L. Medic (TFA) is the major active component isolated from Chinese herb Abelmoschus manihot L. Medic. TFA has shown neuroprotective effect against cerebral ischemia injury in rats and rabbits. However, the effects of TFA on hind-limb ischemia and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Therefore, in the present study, we used a rat hind-limb ischemia model to investigate protective effect of TFA against limb ischemia injury. The rat model of hind-limb ischemia was established. Treatment groups received TFA at two different doses (160 and 40mg/kg) daily for 10 days. Sham operated control group and model group received saline. At the end the rats were sacrificed, hindlimb tissues were stained with Haematoxylin-Eosin and Masson's trichrome. RNA and protein were extracted from tissues for PCR and Western blot analysis. The results showed that TFA reduced lower limb ischemic injury, recovered tissue volume and diminished fibrosis and muscle degeneration. Mechanistically, we showed that TFA increased the expression of anti-apoptotic factor such as Bcl-2 and survivin, decreased the expression of pro-apoptotic factor such as Caspase 3, Bax and Bak and inhibited the activation of caspase 3 and 9. In summary, this study proves new evidence that TFA protects hind-limb against ischemia injury by inhibiting apoptosis and could be a promising therapeutic agent for acute lower extremity ischemia.	flavone ischemia
1	Application of microdialysis for elucidating the existing form of hyperoside in rat brain: comparison between intragastric and intraperitoneal administration.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort) is an important anti-depressant herb used in clinic and commonly prescribed for mild depression. Hyperoside is one of the major components of H. perforatum and is also detected in many plant species such as Abelmoschus manihot, Black Currant, Rosa agrestis, Apocynum venetum and Nelumbo nucifera. AIM OF THE STUDY: As the hyperoside showed CNS (central nervous system) protective activity (e.g. anti-depressant-like effect), the possibility of hyperoside or its metabolites to reach CNS should be investigated. Moreover, the pharmacokinetics profile of hyperoside or its metabolites in rat brain should be studied for further elucidating the mechanism of hyperoside action on CNS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A simple method for simultaneous determination of unbound hyperoside and its metabolite 3'-O-methyl-hyperoside in rat brain was developed by using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) and microdialysis technique. This method was applied for pharmacokinetics study of hyperoside and 3'-O-methyl-hyperoside in rat brain after intragastric (i.g.) and intraperitoneally (i.p.) administration of hyperoside in vivo. RESULTS: Results showed that neither hyperoside nor its metabolites were detected in rat brain after i.g. administration but both compounds could be detected after i.p. administration. Considering the activity of hyperoside through both i.g. and i.p. administration, our results imply that the active components of hyperoside in vivo might be different. Therefore, further studies are needed to identify the active components of hyperoside in vivo through these two different routes. Moreover, non-oral administration route (e.g., i.p.) should be further investigated and be explored to obtain higher bioavailability and better activity for hyperoside. Our results also showed that the real existing form of hyperoside in rat brain were hyperoside and its methylated metabolite with maximum concentration to be 63.78 ng/mL and 24.66 ng/mL after 20mg/kg i.p. administration, respectively. Therefore, a more reasonable concentration of hyperoside should be considered in in vitro assay to reflect the real situation of hyperoside concentration in vivo. CONCLUSION: Due to the wide use of herbal remedies containing hyperoside, our investigation will contribute to further clarifying the action of this substance. Moreover, this method will be applied for clinical pharmacokinetics study of hyperoside and its metabolite as well as herbs that contain hyperoside.	abelmoschus manihot hyperoside
2	Hypoglycemic effects of three Iranian edible plants; jujube, barberry and saffron: Correlation with serum adiponectin level.One of the most common disorders of the endocrine system is diabetes mellitus. This disease is associated with dyslipidemia. Adiponectin is a protein hormone that secreted by adipocytes and has an important role in regulating of glucose and fatty acid metabolic pathways. This study was designed to investigate the changes in serum level of adiponectin in diabetic rats treated with hydroalcoholic extracts of three medicinal plants; jujube (Ziziphus jujuba), barberry (Berberis vulgaris) and saffron (Crocus sativus) in comparison with quercetin. Streptozotocin -induced diabetic male rats were gavaged with specified doses of the extracts (25 and 100mg/kg) for two weeks. At the end of treatment period, fasting blood specimens were collected. The levels of adiponectin, fasting blood sugar (FBS), total Cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-C and LDL-C were measured. Statistical analysis showed that serum levels of triglyceride and VLDL decreased significantly (P&lt;0.05) in all treated groups. FBS level in all treated groups, decreased significantly and reach to normoglycemic level (P&lt;0.05). Except Jujube, other plant extracts had no effect on cholesterol. Jujube in two doses (25 and 100mg/kg) could increased significantly HDL-C (P&lt;0.05) with no effect on total cholesterol and LDL-C. Serum adiponectin level increased in all treated groups. These beneficial effects of C. sativus, B. vulgaris and Z. jujube extracts and quercetin in diabetic rats may be associated with increase in adiponectin level. 	jujube diabetic
1	FEMA GRAS assessment of natural flavor complexes: Cinnamomum and Myroxylon-derived flavoring ingredients.In 2015, the Expert Panel of the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association (FEMA) initiated a program for the re-evaluation of the safety of over 250 natural flavor complexes (NFCs) used as flavor ingredients. This publication, third in the series, considers NFCs composed primarily of constituents with the 3-phenyl-2-propenyl or a cinnamyl functional group, using the procedure outlined in 2005 and updated in 2018 to evaluate the safety of naturally-occurring mixtures for their intended use as flavor ingredients. The procedure relies on a complete chemical characterization of the NFC intended for commerce and organization of each NFC's chemical constituents into well-defined congeneric groups. The safety of the NFC is evaluated using the well-established and conservative threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) concept in addition to data on absorption, metabolism, and toxicology of members of the congeneric groups and the NFC under evaluation. Six NFCs from the Myroxylon and Cinnamomum genera, Balsam Oil, Peru (FEMA 2117), Tolu Balsam Extract (FEMA 3069), Cassia Bark Extract (FEMA 2257), Cassia Bark Oil (FEMA 2258), Cinnamon Bark Extract (FEMA 2290) and Cinnamon Bark Oil (FEMA 2291) were evaluated and affirmed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) under their conditions of intended use as flavor ingredients.

2	Enhancement of anti-cholinesterase activity of Zingiber cassumunar essential oil using a microemulsion technique.The aim of the present study was to enhance the cholinesterase inhibitory activity of Zingiber cassumunar (ZC) oil using a microemulsion (ME) technique. Pseudoternary phase diagrams of the oil, water, and surfactant/co-surfactant mixture were constructed using a water titration method. Effects of co-surfactant, surfactant/co-surfactant ratio, ionic strength, and pH were examined by means of the microemulsion region which existed in the phase diagrams. The inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) were tested by Ellman's colorimetric assay. It was found that ZC oil possesses inhibitory activity against not only AChE but also BChE. Formulation of ZC oil as ME revealed that alkyl chain length and number of hydroxyl groups of co-surfactant exhibited a remarkable effect on the pseudoternary phase diagram. Longer alkyl chains and more hydroxyl groups gave smaller regions of MEs. Ionic strength also affected the ME region. However, the phase behavior was hardly influenced by pH. The suitable ZC oil ME was composed of Triton X-114 in combination with propylene glycol. The anti-cholinesterase activity of this ME was much higher than that of native ZC oil. It exhibited twenty times and twenty five times higher inhibitory activity against AChE and BChE, respectively. ZC oil loaded ME is an attractive formulation for further characterization and an in vivo study in an animal model with Alzheimer's disease.	ZC alzheimer's disease
1	Pharmacokinetics of daikenchuto, a traditional Japanese medicine (kampo) after single oral administration to healthy Japanese volunteers.The pharmacokinetics of daikenchuto (TJ-100), a pharmaceutical-grade traditional Japanese medicine, were investigated in healthy Japanese volunteers after a single oral administration of 2.5-, 5-, and 10-g doses. Six ingredients [hydroxy-alpha-sanshool (HAS), hydroxy-beta-sanshool (HBS), [6]-shogaol (6S), [10]-shogaol (10S), ginsenoside Rb1(GRB1), and ginsenoside Rg1(GRG1)] of TJ-100 were determined by using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The results indicated that HAS, an ingredient derived from Zanthoxylum piperitum fruit, exhibited the highest plasma concentration among the six ingredients investigated. The plasma concentrations of HAS, HBS, 6S, and 10S reached the maximum concentration (approximately 400, 80, 0.14, and 0.6 ng/ml, respectively, after a 5-g administration of TJ-100) within 30 min after administration, and the mean half-life was approximately 2 h. Thus, these compounds were rapidly absorbed and eliminated. The plasma concentration of GRB1 reached the maximum concentration (2 ng/ml after a 5-g administration of TJ-100) at approximately 4 h after administration and the half-life of GRB1 was approximately 40 h. The plasma concentration of GRG1 was extremely low (&lt;0.023 ng/ml). The pharmacokinetics of HAS, HBS, 6S, and 10S, were linear within the range of 2.5 to 10 g/day of TJ-100. On the other hand, the kinetics of GRB1 and GRG1 were not proportional to dosage, and plateauing was observed.	zanthoxylum piperitum hydroxy-beta-sanshool
1	[Study on relative bioavailability of ferulic acid of combination Radix Angelicae Sinensis and Cortex Cinnamomi in mice].OBJECTIVE: To study the phamacokinetics and relative bioavailability of combination Radix Angelicae Sinensis and Cortex Cinnamomi. METHOD: The content of ferulic acid in plasma was determined directly by HPLC after oral administration of Cortex Cinnamomi in combination individually with Radix Angelicae Sinensis.

CONCLUSION: By the statistical analysis, Cortex Cinnamomi combined with Radix Angelicae Sinensis can increase the relative bioavailability of ferulic acid.	Species ferulic acid
3	A New Megastigmane Sesquiterpenoid from Zanthoxylum Schinifolium Sieb. et Zucc.Zanthoxylum schinifolium Sieb. et Zucc. (Rutaceae), a dioecious shrub with hooked prickly branches, has been used as folk medicine for the treatment of the common cold, stomach ache, diarrhea, and jaundice in China, Korea, and Japan. In our phytochemical investigations on this genus, a new megastigmane sesquiterpenoid, which is referred to as schinifolenol A (1), was isolated from Z. schinifolium. The stereochemistry was characterized via the analyses of extensive spectra. The absolute configuration was established by the application of a modified Mosher's experiment and assisted by a time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) on calculated electronic circular dichroism (ECD). Bioactivity screenings showed that compound 1 exhibited a safe hypotoxicity and a better selectivity on anti-Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpes virus (KSHV). 	megastigmane kaposi's sarcoma
3	Anti-inflammatory mechanism of lonchocarpine in LPS- or poly(I:C)-induced neuroinflammation.Neuroinflammation plays an important role in the progression of various neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of lonchocarpine, a natural compound isolated from Abrus precatorius, under in vitro and in vivo neuroinflammatory conditions induced by challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- or polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)). Lonchocarpine suppressed the expression of iNOS and proinflammatory cytokines in LPS or poly(I:C)-stimulated BV2 microglial cells. These anti-inflammatory effects were verified in brains of mice with systemic inflammation induced by administration of LPS or poly(I:C). Lonchocarpine reduced the number of Iba-1-positive activated microglia, and suppressed the mRNA expression of various proinflammatory markers in the cortex of LPS- or poly(I:C)-injected mice. Molecular mechanistic experiments showed that lonchocarpine inhibited NF-kappaB activity by reducing the phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaBalpha in LPS- or poly(I:C)-stimulated BV2 cells. Analysis of further upstream signaling pathways in LPS-stimulated microglia showed that lonchocarpine inhibited the phosphorylation of IkappaB kinase and TGFbeta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1). Moreover, lonchocarpine suppressed the interaction of myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and intereleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4). These data suggest that toll-like receptor 4 downstream signals such as MyD88/IRAK4-TAK1-NF-kappaB are at least partly involved in the anti-inflammatory mechanism of lonchocarpine in LPS-stimulated microglia. Its strong anti-inflammatory effects may make lonchocarpine an effective preventative drug for neuroinflammatory disorders that are associated with systemic inflammation.	lonchocarpine neurodegenerative diseases
2	Cinnamon: a multifaceted medicinal plant.Cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum, and Cinnamon cassia), the eternal tree of tropical medicine, belongs to the Lauraceae family. Cinnamon is one of the most important spices used daily by people all over the world. Cinnamon primarily contains vital oils and other derivatives, such as cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid, and cinnamate. In addition to being an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, anticancer, lipid-lowering, and cardiovascular-disease-lowering compound, cinnamon has also been reported to have activities against neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. This review illustrates the pharmacological prospective of cinnamon and its use in daily life. 	cinnamon neurological disorders
2	Large-scale and effective screening of Korean medicinal plants for inhibitory activity on matrix metalloproteinase-9.Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) degrades type IV collagen constituting the major structural component of the basement membrane and extra cellular membrane. The enzymatic activity is found to be elevated in tumor tissues. With the aim of finding novel MMP-9 inhibitors from natural products, 87 extracts of oriental medicinal herbs, which are used as prescriptions for cancer treatment in traditional Korean medicine, were screened for their inhibitory activities towards MMP-9. It was found that most of the hexane and chloroform fractions as well as water extracts showed a weak inhibitory effect on MMP-9 activity at a concentration of 100mug/ml. However, a strong inhibition was found in the butanol fractions of Cinnamomum cassia PRESL, Magnolia obovata THUEB., Magnolia officinalis REHD. et WILS., Magnolia officinalis REHD. et WILS. var. biloba REHD. et WILS., and Euonymus alatus (THUNB.) SIEB. with inhibitory activity (&gt;90%) at a concentration of 100 microg/ml.	magnolia obovata cancer
1	In vitro assessment of synergistic combinations of essential oils against Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus (Acari: Ixodidae).Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus (Acari: Ixodidae), is one of the most important ectoparasite of cattle, responsible for causing severe economic losses in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The development of resistance to most of the commonly used chemical acaricides has stimulated the search for new herbal products as an eco-friendly tick control alternative. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro acaricidal activity of essential oils (EOs) of cloves (Syzygium aromaticum), bark of cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum) and leaves of lemon grass (Cymbopogon citratus) against unfed larvae of R. (B.)microplus by larval packet test. Also, various combinations were prepared by mixing of equal concentrations of any two and all three EOs and used to study the effects of interactions of mixtures against larvae of R. (B.) microplus. The lethal concentrations at 50% (LC50), 90% (LC90) and 99% (LC99) with 95% confidence limits (CL) were estimated by Probit analysis using PoloPlus. The computer software, CompuSyn, was used for determining the effects of interactions (synergistic, additive or antagonistic) of EO mixtures by calculation of Combination index (CI) and Dose-reduction index (DRI). Among the individual and mixture of two EOs, cinnamon EO and cinnamon EO + lemon grass EO combination showed highest acaricidal activity against R. (B.) microplus larvae. Further, the combination of cinnamon EO + lemon grass EO showed high synergism with CI value of 0.381, followed by cinnamon EO + clove EO showing moderate synergism whereas, clove EO + lemon grass EO showed only additive effect, with favorable dose reduction for each constituent drug in all three combinations. The combination of all three EOs (1:1:1) showed high synergism (CI value of 0.376) and favorable dose reduction (DRI index of 8.19, 25.64 and 4.64 for clove, cinnamon and lemon grass EOs, respectively) against R. (B.) microplus larvae.	lemon grass essential oils
2	Determination of coumarin in seasonal bakery products using QuEChERS and GC-MS.Cinnamon is a traditional herbal drug, but more importantly, it is used as a flavor compound in the production of foodstuff. Due to the content of significant concentrations of coumarin in Cassia cinnamon, effective control of the coumarin content in seasonal bakery products like ginger bread and cinnamon biscuits is urgently needed. Here we present a novel, fast and fully validated protocol for the determination of coumarin in marketed bakery products using the QuEChERS sample preparation technique in combination with GC-MS analysis. Ten grams of homogenized sample was mixed with 20 mL acetonitrile/water (1:1) and 5 g magnesium sulfate/sodium chloride mixture (4:1). The organic phase was cleaned by dSPE with 25 mg magnesium sulfate/PSA (5:1). The LOD was 0.15 mug/mL and the LOQ 0.50 mug/mL. We detected a mean coumarin content of 19.5 mug/kg in 9 out of 14 seasonal food products (ranging from 1.45 to 39.4 mg/kg). No coumarin was detected in five cinnamon containing products. With this investigation we demonstrate that the QuEChERS sample preparation, previously applied mainly to the analysis of pesticides in vegetables, is also suitable for other complex matrices.	cinnamon coumarin
1	Comparative analysis of chemical compositions and antimicrobial activities of essential oils from Abies holophylla and Abies koreana activities of essential oils from Abies holophylla and Abies koreana.The chemical compositions and antibacterial and antifungal activities of essential oils extracted from Abies holophylla and A. koreana were investigated. GC-MS analysis revealed that 38 compounds comprised 95.88% of the A. holophylla essential oil, with the main components being bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-ol (28.05%), delta3-carene (13.85%), alpha-pinene (11.68%), camphene (10.41%), dl-limonene (7.61%), beta-myrcene (7.11%), trans-caryophyllene (5.36%), and alpha- bisabolol (3.67%). In the essential oil from A. koreana, 36 compounds comprised 98.67% of the oil, and the main compounds were bornyl ester (41.79%), camphene (15.31%), alpha-pinene (11.19%), dl-limonene (8.58%), fenchyl acetate (5.55%), and alpha-terpinene (2.29%). Both essential oils showed great potential of antibacterial activity against several bacteria tested, in the range of 2.2-8.8 mug per disc by the agar disc diffusion method, and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 5.5-21.8 mg/ml by the microdilution method. Both oils showed very effective antifungal activities toward all pathogenic strains tested, including Candida glabrata, with MIC values in the range of 0.5-2.2 mg/ml. As a whole, A.koreanaoil showed better antibacterial and antifungal properties than A.holophylla oil.	a. holophylla dl-limonene
3	Anticancer effect of a new benzophenanthridine isolated from Zanthoxylum madagascariense (Rutaceline).Fractionation of the cyclohexane extract from the stem bark powder of Zanthoxylum madagascariense led to the isolation of a new benzophenanthridine-type alkaloid, hydrochloride of 2,3-methylendioxy-8-hydroxy- 7-methoxy-benzo[C]phenanthridine (Rutaceline), characterized on the basis of its spectral data. Rutaceline was evaluated for its antiproliferative capacity on the human colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) and the African green monkey kidney (Vero) cell lines. The 50% inhibition of cell growth (IC50) obtained after 24 h incubation was similar for both cells lines (110-115 microg/ml, i.e. 269-281 microM), but at 48 h the IC50 value for the Caco-2 cells was lower than for the Vero cells (20 microg/lml, i.e. 49 microM versus 90 microg/ml, i.e. 220 microM) indicating a higher cell growth inhibitory effect on the colon adenocarcinoma cells. At the respective IC50 concentrations, Rutaceline did not significantly induce apoptosis but induced cell cycle arrest in the GO/G1 phase, as well as a decrease of cells in S phase. Rutaceline also induced DNA fragmentation in both cell lines, as revealed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and a dose-dependent clastogenic effect in both cell lines as revealed by the Comet assay.	benzophenanthridine colorectal adenocarcinoma
2	Drug Target Identification and Elucidation of Natural Inhibitors for Bordetella petrii: An In Silico Study.Environmental microbes like Bordetella petrii has been established as a causative agent for various infectious diseases in human. Again, development of drug resistance in B. petrii challenged to combat against the infection. Identification of potential drug target and proposing a novel lead compound against the pathogen has a great aid and value. In this study, bioinformatics tools and technology have been applied to suggest a potential drug target by screening the proteome information of B. petrii DSM 12804 (accession No. PRJNA28135) from genome database of National Centre for Biotechnology information. In this regards, the inhibitory effect of nine natural compounds like ajoene (Allium sativum), allicin (A. sativum), cinnamaldehyde (Cinnamomum cassia), curcumin (Curcuma longa), gallotannin (active component of green tea and red wine), isoorientin (Anthopterus wardii), isovitexin (A. wardii), neral (Melissa officinalis), and vitexin (A. wardii) have been acknowledged with anti-bacterial properties and hence tested against identified drug target of B. petrii by implicating computational approach. The in silico studies revealed the hypothesis that lpxD could be a potential drug target and with recommendation of a strong inhibitory effect of selected natural compounds against infection caused due to B. petrii, would be further validated through in vitro experiments.	b. petrii infectious diseases
3	Phytochemical profiles, antioxidant activities of functional herb Abrus cantoniensis and Abrus mollis.It has been claimed that consumptions of Abrus cantoniensis (AC) and Abrus mollis (AM) as folk beverages and soups are good to cleanse liver toxicants and prevent liver diseases. There is scant information on the phytochemical profiles and antioxidant activities of these two varieties. Five major phytochemicals in these two cultivars were qualitatively and quantitatively compared using UPLC-PDA. A high level of total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC) was found in AC and AM. AC, in general, showed some antioxidant activities comparable to that of BHT, and stronger radical scavenging activities and higher reducing power than that of AM (p&lt;0.05). When principal component analysis (PCA) was applied, high correlation between TPC, TFC and their antioxidant activities was found. Hence, this study proved that, both AC and AM could serve as antioxidant-rich component in foods or beverages to promote health function. 	flavonoid liver diseases
2	[Mechanisms and effects of Abelmoschus manihot preparations in treating chronic kidney disease].Abelmoschus manihot (AM) is a medicinal plant rich in twenty kinds of separated active bio-components including flavones, polysaccharides, trannic acid, and long chain hydrocarbons. Among these, total flavones of A. manihot (TFA) are the major active component. In this review, the mechanisms of Huangkui capsule will be discussed as a preparation of AM to treat chronic kidney disease (CKD) by improving immunological reaction, inflammation, renal fibrosis, and renal tubular epithelial injury. Additionally, it has been reported that Huangkui capsule can ameliorate some clinical symptoms, proteinuria, hematuria, and renal function in patients with common CKD, such as nephrotic syndrome, diabetic nephropathy, Henoch-Schonlein purpura nephritis, IgA nephropathy, and membranous nephropathy.

3	Separation and purification of saponins from Semen Ziziphus jujuba and their sedative and hypnotic effects.Semen Ziziphus jujuba (SZJ) has long been used in Chinese traditional medicine for the treatment of anxiety and insomnia because of its effect of decreasing monoaminergic system activity; saponins are thought to be the main bioactive factors. To investigate the sedative and hypnotic effects of saponins from SZJ, silica gel column chromatography and thin-layer chromatography were used to purify the crude extract of total saponins from SZJ. High-performance liquid chromatography showed that saponins from SZJ comprised two components, compounds I and II. Animal tests were conducted using these two compounds to compare their sedative and hypnotic effects. Results showed that both compounds had a significant effect (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01) on walking time compared with that of the control group. Compound I had a significant effect on coordinated movement (P &lt; 0.05). Both compounds prolonged the suprathreshold barbiturate induced sleeping time (P &lt; 0.05). The number of sleeping animals increased by 30% and 20% for compounds I and II, respectively, under the subthreshold dose of sodium barbital.	saponins anxiety
2	An Unusual Tetrahydrofuran Lignan from the Roots of Zanthoxylum planispinum and the Potential Anti-inflammatory Effects.An unusual tetrahydrofuran lignin, zanthplanispine (1), together with 14 known lignans (2 - 15) were isolated from the AcOEt-soluble fraction from the MeOH extract of Z. planispinum roots. The structures of 1 was elucidated on the basis of 1D- and 2D-NMR experiments as well as HR-ESI-MS analysis. The known compounds were identified by the comparison of their NMR data with previously reported in the literatures. Bioassay showed that compounds 1 - 4 could inhibit nitric oxide (NO) production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. In particular, compound 1 showed significant inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 36.8 mum.	z. planispinum tetrahydrofuran lignan
1	Reverse Phase Compatible TLC-Bioautography for Detection of Tyrosinase Inhibitors.INTRODUCTION: Reverse phase chromatography and bioautographic assays are key tools for natural product bioguided isolation; however, their direct coupling has not been fully achieved. OBJECTIVES: To develop a bioautographic assay to detect tyrosinase inhibitors present in complex matrices sorbed on reverse phase (RP) TLC-plates that can be used for bioguided isolation of bioactive compounds. METHODS: Enzyme gel entrapment with an amphiphilic copolymer was used for assay development. The gel turns into a brown "skin like" colour due to tyrosinase catalysed oxidation of l-tyrosine. The inhibitors are visualised as clear spots against a brown coloured background. RESULTS: The assay was able to localise cinnamaldehyde in Cinnamomum cassia essential oil, as its main constituent with known tyrosinase inhibition properties. The assay allowed the detection of 0.03% (w/w) of kojic acid co-spotted with a methanolic extract of Sphaeralcea bonariensis and chromatographed on RP-TLC. CONCLUSION: The developed assay is able to detect, with high sensitivity, tyrosinase inhibitors present in complex matrices that were chromatographed in RP-TLC. Results can be easily read by colour change, inhibitors appear as clear spots in a darker background. Copyright   2016 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.	cinnamomum cassia cinnamaldehyde
1	Effects of cassia oil on serum and hepatic uric acid levels in oxonate-induced mice and xanthine dehydrogenase and xanthine oxidase activities in mouse liver.We investigated the hypouricemic effects of cassia oil extracted from Cinnamomum cassia using hyperuricemic mice induced by potassium oxonate, and its inhibitory actions against liver xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) and xanthine oxidase (XOD) activities. Oral administration of cassia oil significantly reduced serum and hepatic urate levels in hyperuricemic mice in a time- and dose-dependent manner. At doses of 450 mg/kg of cassia oil or above, serum urate levels of the oxonate-pretreated mice were not different from the normal control mice. Cassia oil at 600 mg/kg was found to be as potent as allopurinol, which reduced hepatic urate levels to lower than normal. In normal mice, urate levels in liver, but not in serum, were altered with dose-dependent decrease after cassia oil treatment. Furthermore, the ratio, liver uric acid/serum uric acid, was determined after cassia oil administration with time- and dose-dependent decreases in hyperuricemic mice. The positive dose-dependent decrease ratio was also observed after cassia oil treatment in the normal animals. The decreased extent of ratio elicited by cassia oil in normal mice appeared to be greater than that in the hyperuricemic animal. In addition, cassia oil significantly exhibited marked reductions in liver XDH/XOD activities, with an apparent dose-dependence in the normal and hyperuricemic mice. The onset of inhibition in enzyme activities elicited by allopurinol was much higher than that elicited by cassia oil. These results suggested that hypouricemic effects of cassia oil could be explained, at least partly, by inhibiting liver in vivo activities of XDH/XOD.	cinnamomum cassia hypouricemic
1	High-performance liquid chromatography--two wavelength detection of triterpenoid acids from the fruits of Ziziphus jujuba containing various cultivars in different regions and classification using chemometric analysis.A simple and sensitive HPLC-DAD method has been developed for the first time to simultaneously determine 10 triterpenoid acids (ceanothic acid, alphitolic acid, zizyberanal acid, zizyberanalic acid, epiceanothic acid, ceanothenic acid, betulinic acid, oleanolic acid, ursonic acid and zizyberenalic acid) in the dried fruit of Ziziphus jujuba (called Dazao) which has been widely used as one of the traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs). This HPLC assay was performed on a reversed-phase C(18) column (250 mm x 4.6mm, 5 microm) with the column temperature at 35 degrees C. The mobile phase was composed of A (acetonitrile) and B (0.05% aqueous phosphoric acid, v/v). The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min and the detection wave length was set at 205 nm for reference compounds 1-9 and 238 nm for reference compound 10. All calibration curves showed good linear regression (r(2)&gt;0.9999) within the test range. The established method showed good precision and accuracy with overall intra-day and inter-day variations of 0.43-1.72% and 0.53-2.45%, respectively, and overall recoveries of 94.98-104.09% for the 10 compounds analyzed. The validated method was successfully applied for the simultaneous determination of the 10 triterpenoid acids in 42 batches of Dazao which contained 36 cultivars from 22 cultivation regions, and were investigated and authenticated as Z. jujuba. Hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) and principal components analysis (PCA) were performed to differentiate and classify the samples based on the contents of the 10 triterpenoid acids. The presented HPLC-DAD method conjugated with chemometrics approach was demonstrated to be very helpful in using Dazao resources, and was possibly useful in chemotaxonomic characterization.	z. jujuba triterpenoid acids

1	Evaluation of the antioxidant effects of Ziziphus mauritiana Lam. Leaf extracts against chronic ethanol-induced hepatotoxicity in rat liver.Chronic alcohol ingestion is known to increase the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby leading to liver damage. Antioxidant enzymes act individually or in combination to reduce or counter the effect of these ROS. Chronic administration of alcohol at (40% v/v, 1 ml/100 g), for 6 weeks showed a significant (p&lt;0.05) elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bilirubin (TB). There was also a significant (p&lt;0.05) decreased levels of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and superoxide dismutase compared to control rats. Pre-treatment of rats with 200, 400 mg/kg body weight of aqueous leaf extract of Ziziphus mauritiana or 100 mg/kg silymarin resulted in a significant (p&lt;0.05) decreased levels of ALT, AST, ALP, and TB with levels of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and superoxide dismutase showing a significant (p&lt;0.05) increase compared to group administered alcohol only. Histopathology of rat liver administered with alcohol only resulted in severe necrosis, mononuclear cell aggregation and fatty degeneration in the central and mid zonal areas which was a characteristic of a damaged liver. Pre-treatment with the aqueous extract of Ziziphus mauritiana or silymarin reduced the morphological changes that are associated with chronic alcohol administration. The presence of tannins, saponins and phenolic compounds observed in the plant extract could be responsible for the observed effects of decreasing the levels of injured tissue marker and lipid peroxidation.	ziziphus mauritiana saponins
1	Cloning and molecular characterization of the basic peroxidase isoenzyme from Zinnia elegans, an enzyme involved in lignin biosynthesis.The major basic peroxidase from Zinnia elegans (ZePrx) suspension cell cultures was purified and cloned, and its properties and organ expression were characterized. The ZePrx was composed of two isoforms with a M(r) (determined by matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization time of flight) of 34,700 (ZePrx34.70) and a M(r) of 33,440 (ZePrx33.44). Both isoforms showed absorption maxima at 403 (Soret band), 500, and 640 nm, suggesting that both are high-spin ferric secretory class III peroxidases. M(r) differences between them were due to the glycan moieties, and were confirmed from the total similarity of the N-terminal sequences (LSTTFYDTT) and by the 99.9% similarity of the tryptic fragment fingerprints obtained by reverse-phase nano-liquid chromatography. Four full-length cDNAs coding for these peroxidases were cloned. They only differ in the 5'-untranslated region. These differences probably indicate different ways in mRNA transport, stability, and regulation. According to the k(cat) and apparent K(m)(RH) values shown by both peroxidases for the three monolignols, sinapyl alcohol was the best substrate, the endwise polymerization of sinapyl alcohol by both ZePrxs yielding highly polymerized lignins with polymerization degrees &gt; or =87. Western blots using anti-ZePrx34.70 IgGs showed that ZePrx33.44 was expressed in tracheary elements, roots, and hypocotyls, while ZePrx34.70 was only expressed in roots and young hypocotyls. None of the ZePrx isoforms was significantly expressed in either leaves or cotyledons. A neighbor-joining tree constructed for the four full-length cDNAs suggests that the four putative paralogous genes encoding the four cDNAs result from duplication of a previously duplicated ancestral gene, as may be deduced from the conserved nature and conserved position of the introns.	zinnia elegans sinapyl alcohol
1	Effect of water deficit and domestic storage on the procyanidin profile, size, and aggregation process in pear-jujube (Z. jujuba) fruits.No information exists on the proanthocyanidin content of pear-jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill) fruit, their polymeric types and sizes, and their self-aggregation, or on the effect of different water deficit levels during the fruit maturation period on these compounds. Two trimers, two tetramers, and six B type procyanidin pentamers were identified and quantified for the first time. Water deficit increased the content of procyanidins of low molecular mass, improving their potential bioavailability and possible physiological effects on human health. The tendency of procyanidins to self-aggregate was similar in the edible portion and pit, and was not affected by water deficit. The procyanidin content of fruit from well watered trees increased during domestic cold storage, whereas the fruits from trees suffering severe water stress lost some of their procyanidin content. 	ziziphus jujuba mill proanthocyanidin
2	Abrin Toxicity and Bioavailability after Temperature and pH Treatment.Abrin, one of most potent toxins known to man, is derived from the rosary pea (jequirity pea), Abrus precatorius and is a potential bioterror weapon. The temperature and pH stability of abrin was evaluated with an in vitro cell free translation (CFT) assay, a Vero cell culture cytotoxicity assay, and an in vivo mouse bioassay. pH treatment of abrin had no detrimental effect on its stability and toxicity as seen either in vitro or in vivo. Abrin exposure to increasing temperatures did not completely abrogate protein translation. In both the cell culture cytotoxicity model and the mouse bioassay, abrin's toxic effects were completely abrogated if the toxin was exposed to temperatures of 74  C or higher. In the cell culture model, 63  C-treated abrin had a 30% reduction in cytotoxicity which was validated in the in vivo mouse bioassay with all mice dying but with a slight time-to-death delay as compared to the non-treated abrin control. Since temperature inactivation did not affect abrin's ability to inhibit protein synthesis (A-chain), we hypothesize that high temperature treatment affected abrin's ability to bind to cellular receptors (affecting B-chain). Our results confirm the absolute need to validate in vitro cytotoxicity assays with in vivo mouse bioassays.	abrus precatorius cytotoxicity
2	Inhibition of benzo[a]pyrene- and cyclophoshamide-induced mutagenicity by Cinnamomum cassia.Cinnamomum cassia is used as a flavoring spice with some established medicinal properties. In this study, we evaluated the antimutagenic effect of C. cassia against two mutagens, viz. benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) and cyclophosphamide (CP). The antimutagenic properties of C. cassia were examined by the Ames test. In vivo chromosomal aberration (CA) and micronuclei tests were also employed to assess the antimutagenic effect of C. cassia in mice after pretreatment with the extract orally for seven consecutive days. To elucidate the mechanism by which C. cassia exerts its antimutagenic effect, certain key enzymes involved in bioactivation and detoxification processes were also investigated. Changes in liver cytochrome P450 (Cyt P450), glutathione content (GSH), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) were evaluated in pretreated animals. It was observed in the Ames test, bone marrow chromosomal aberration assay, and micronucleus test that C. cassia exerted significant antimutagenic effects against B[a]P and CP in animals treated with the plant extract. C. cassia pretreatment decreased Cyt P450 content but increased GSH content and the activity of glutathione-dependent antioxidant enzymes, viz. GST, GR, and GPX. The present findings demonstrate that the antimutagenic potential of C. cassia could be attributed to its modulatory effect on the xenobiotic bioactivation and detoxification processes.	c. cassia antimutagenic effect
1	Alkaloids from the roots of Zanthoxylum nitidum and their antiviral and antifungal effects.Five alkaloids, 5,6-dihydro-6-methoxynitidine (1), dictamnine (2), gamma-fagarine (3), skimmianine (4), and 5-methoxydictamnine (5), were isolated from the roots of Zanthoxylum nitidum. Their structures and configurations were elucidated by spectroscopic methods and X-ray analysis. Compounds 1, 4, and 5 showed in vitro antiviral effect against hepatitis B virus, and compounds 2, 3, and 5 demonstrated marked antimitotic and antifungal activity.	zanthoxylum nitidum 5,6-dihydro-6-methoxynitidine
2	Bioactivity of cinnamon with special emphasis on diabetes mellitus: a review.Cinnamon is the oldest spice and has been used by several cultural practices for centuries. In addition to its culinary uses, cinnamon possesses a rising popularity due to many stated health benefits. Out of the large number of cinnamon species available, Cinnamomum aromaticum (Cassia) and Cinnamomum zeylanicum have been subjected to extensive research. Available in vitro and in vivo evidence indicates that cinnamon may have multiple health benefits, mainly in relation to hypoglycaemic activity. Furthermore, the therapeutic potential of cinnamon is stated also to be brought about by its anti-microbial, anti-fungal, antiviral, antioxidant, anti-tumour, blood pressure-lowering, cholesterol and lipid-lowering and gastro-protective properties. This article provides a summary of the scientific literature available on both C. aromaticum and C. zeylanicum. All studies reported here have used cinnamon bark and its products. Although almost all the animal models have indicated a pronounced anti-diabetic activity of both cinnamon species, conflicting results were observed with regard to the few clinical trials available. Therefore, the necessity of evaluating the effects of cinnamon for its therapeutic potential through well-defined and adequately powered randomized controlled clinical trials is emphasized, before recommendations are made for the use of cinnamon as an effective treatment for humans.	c. aromaticum tumour
1	Hydroxy-alpha-sanshool activates TRPV1 and TRPA1 in sensory neurons.Sanshools are major active ingredients of Zanthoxylum piperitum and are used as food additives in East Asia. Sanshools cause irritant, tingling and sometimes paresthetic sensations on the tongue. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the pungent or tingling sensation induced by sanshools is not known. Because many transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are responsible for the sensations induced by various spices and food additives, we expressed 17 TRP channels in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells and investigated their activation by hydroxy-alpha-sanshool (HalphaSS) or hydroxy-beta-sanshool (HbetaSS) isolated from Zanthoxylum piperitum. It was found that HalphaSS, but not HbetaSS, depolarized sensory neurons with concomitant firing of action potentials and evoked inward currents. Among 17 TRP channels expressed in HEK cells, HalphaSS caused Ca(2+) influx in cells transfected with TRPV1 or TRPA1, and evoked robust inward currents in cells transfected with TRPV1 or TRPA1. In primary cultured sensory neurons, HalphaSS induced inward currents and Ca(2+) influx in a capsazepine-dependent manner. Moreover, HalphaSS-induced currents and Ca(2+) influx were greatly diminished in TRPV1(-/-) mice. HalphaSS evoked licking behavior when injected into a single hind paw of wild-type mice, but this was much reduced in TRPV1-deficient mice. These results indicate that TRPV1 and TRPA1 are molecular targets of HalphaSS in sensory neurons. We conclude that the activations of TRPV1 and TRPA1 by HalphaSS explain its unique pungent, tingling sensation.	zanthoxylum piperitum HalphaSS
2	A 12-Week, Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial for Evaluation of the Efficacy and Safety of DKB114 on Reduction of Uric Acid in Serum.This study sought to investigate the antihyperuricemia efficacy and safety of DKB114 (a mixture of Chrysanthemum indicum Linn flower extract and Cinnamomum cassia extract) to evaluate its potential as a dietary supplement ingredient. This clinical trial was a randomized, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. A total of 80 subjects (40 subjects with an intake of DKB114 and 40 subjects with that of placebo) who had asymptomatic hyperuricemia (7.0-9.0 mg/dL with serum uric acid) was randomly assigned. No significant difference between the DKB114 and placebo groups was observed in the amount of uric acid in serum after six weeks of intake. However, after 12 weeks of intake, the uric acid level in serum of subjects in the DKB114 group decreased by 0.58 +- 0.86 mg/dL and was 7.37 +- 0.92 mg/dL, whereas that in the placebo group decreased by 0.02 +- 0.93 mg/dL and was 7.67 +- 0.89 mg/dL, a significant difference (p = 0.0229). In the analysis of C-reactive protein (CRP) change, after 12 weeks of administration, the DKB114 group showed an increase of 0.05 +- 0.27 mg/dL (p = 0.3187), while the placebo group showed an increase of 0.10 +- 0.21 mg/dL (p = 0.0324), a statistically significant difference (p = 0.0443). In the analysis of amount of change in apoprotein B, after 12 weeks of administration, the DKB114 group decreased by 4.75 +- 16.69 mg/dL (p = 0.1175), and the placebo group increased by 3.13 +- 12.64 mg/dL (p = 0.2187), a statistically significant difference between the administration groups (p = 0.0189). In the clinical pathology test, vital signs and weight measurement, and electrocardiogram test conducted for safety evaluation, no clinically significant difference was found between the ingestion groups, confirming the safety of DKB114. Therefore, it may have potential as a treatment for hyperuricemia and gout. We suggest that DKB114 as a beneficial and safe food ingredient for individuals with high serum uric acid.

4	Abrus precatorius agglutinin-derived peptides induce ROS-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis through JNK and Akt/P38/P53 pathways in HeLa cells.10kDAGP, a tryptic digest of Abrus precatorius lectin 'Agglutinin' is known to induce apoptosis by mitochondria-dependent pathways in human cervical cancer (HeLa) cells. The present study was focused on deciphering the detailed molecular mechanism of apoptosis induction in vitro by 10kDAGP and also its in vivo therapeutic efficacy. For in vivo model, HeLa cell encapsulated hollow fiber was implanted in Swiss Albino mice and treated with 10kDAGP. Our results showed that 10kDAGP was able to enter the cell within a span of 20min and co-localized with mitochondria after 90min. of incubation. A drastic loss of mitochondrial membrane potential was noted within 6h of 10kDAGP administration along with an increase in ROS generation. ROS further led to symptoms of early apoptosis by deregulating Akt (Protein Kinase B) and activating c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK), p38 Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK), p53, and autophagy starting from ~8h of incubation. Besides in vitro conditions, 10kDAGP activated JNK to mediate cancer cell killing in vivo. Therefore, 10kDAGP can be an excellent therapeutic agent as it can act through different ways in the cellular system. Future studies are directed to screen out active peptides from the pool of peptides and to study whether the mode of action is in synergistic way or in individual forms. 	JNK cancer

During neuroinflammatory process, microglia are excessively activated and simultaneously release numerous pro-inflammatory mediators that cause synaptic dysfunction in the forebrain prior to neuronal degeneration and memory deficits in AD. Thus, prevention of neuroinflammation-mediated synaptic dysfunction may be a potential therapeutic approach against neurodegenerative disorders. Trans-cinnamaldehyde (TCA) is a primary bioactive component derived from the stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia, and it possesses potent anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities in in vivo and in vitro experiments. However, the in-depth molecular mechanisms of TCA underlying anti-neuroinflammatory and neuroprotective effects on memory deficits in AD are still unclear. The presenilin 1 and 2 conditional double knockout (PS cDKO) mice exhibit AD-like phenotypes including obvious neuroinflammatory responses and synaptic dysfunction and memory deficits. Here, PS cDKO were used to evaluate the potential neuroprotective effects of TCA against neuroinflammation-mediated dementia by performing behavioral tests, electrophysiological recordings and molecular biology analyses. We observed that TCA treatment reversed abnormal expression of synaptic proteins and tau hyperphosphorylation in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of PS cDKO mice. TCA treatment also ameliorated NMDA receptor (NMDAR) dysfunction including impaired NMDAR-mediated responses and long-term potentiation (LTP) induction in the hippocampus of PS cDKO mice. Moreover, TCA possesses an ability to suppress neuroinflammatory responses by diminishing microglial activation and levels of pro-inflammatory mediators in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of PS cDKO mice. Importantly, improving NMDAR dysfunction and memory deficits of PS cDKO mice was due to the inhibition of neuroinflammatory responses through TCA's interruptive effect on the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway. Therefore, TCA may be a potential anti-neuroinflammatory agent for deterring neurodegenerative progression of AD.	TCA NMDAR
1	Combined treatment with Cinnamaldehyde and beta-TCP had an additive effect on bone formation and angiogenesis in critical size calvarial defect in ovariectomized rats.Accumulating evidence suggests that improvements in osteogenesis and angiogenesis play an important role in repairing osteoporotic bone defects. Cinnamomum cassia (C. cassia), a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, is reported to show anabolic effects on osteoblasts. However, whether C. cassia could actually repair bone defects in osteoporotic conditions remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of combined treatment with Cinnamaldehyde (main oil isolated from the C. cassia) and beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP) on bone formation and angiogenesis in critical size calvarial defects in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Using a previously established OVX model, 5 mm critical size calvarial defect was established in OVX rats. All OVX rats were then randomly divided into OVX group (OVX rats + empty defect), TCP group (OVX rats + beta-TCP), and CTCP group (Cinnamaldehyde 75 mg/kg/day for 12 weeks + beta-TCP). Twelve weeks after treatment, according to Micro-CT and HE staining, combination of Cinnamaldehyde and beta-TCP had an additive effect on bone regeneration compared with other groups (p &lt; 0.05). Based on dynamic fluorochrome-labelling analysis, Cinnamaldehyde+beta-TCP continuously promoted new bone mineralization compared with other groups at each time point (p &lt; 0.05). Microfil perfusion suggested that CTCP group showed more neovascularization compared with other groups (p &lt; 0.05). Immunohistochemical assay supported the findings that Cinnamaldehyde+beta-TCP enhanced expression of OCN, VEGF and CD31. The present study demonstrated that combined treatment with Cinnamaldehyde and beta-TCP promoted bone formation and angiogenesis in osteoporotic bone defects, which provides a promising new strategy for repairing bone defects in osteoporotic conditions.	c. cassia Cinnamaldehyde
1	The Effects of Different Purifying Methods on the Chemical Properties, in Vitro Anti-Tumor and Immunomodulatory Activities of Abrus cantoniensis Polysaccharide Fractions.Abrus cantoniensis (Hance) is a popular Chinese vegetable consumed as a beverage, soup or folk medicine. To fully exploit the potential of the polysaccharide in Abrus cantoniensis, nine polysaccharide fractions of Abrus cantoniensis were isolated and purified (AP-AOH30-1, AP-AOH30-2, AP-AOH80-1, AP-AOH80-2, AP-ACl-1, AP-ACl-2, AP-ACl-3, AP-H and AP-L). Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and gas chromatography (GC) were used to characterize these Abrus polysaccharides fractions (APF). In vitro anti-tumor and immunomodulatory activities were also investigated and compared using the rank-sum ratio (RSR) method. Results demonstrated significant differences in the structure and bioactivities among APF, which were associated to the process used for their purification. Among the APF, AP-ACl-3 yield was 613.5 mg/kg of product and consisted of rhamnose (9.8%), arabinose (8.9%), fructose (3.0%), galactose (9.9%), glucose (4.3%), galacturonic acid (3.0%) and glucuronic acid (61.1%) with a molecular weight of 4.4 x 104 Da. Furthermore, AP-ACl-3 exhibited considerable bioactivities significantly preventing the migration of MCF-7 cells and stimulating lymphocyte proliferation along with nitric oxide (NO) production of peritoneal macrophages. AP-ACl-3 could be explored as a novel potential anti-tumor and immunomodulatory agent. 	abrus cantoniensis tumor
1	Crystal structure of abrin-a at 2.14 A.The crystal structure of abrin-a, a type II ribosome-inactivating protein from the seeds of Abrus precatorius, has been determined from a novel crystalline form by the molecular replacement method using the coordinates of ricin. The structure has been refined at 2.14 A to a R-factor of 18.9%. The root-mean-square deviations of bond lengths and angles from the standard values are 0.013 A and 1.82 degrees, respectively. The overall protein folding is similar to that of ricin, but there are differences in the secondary structure, mostly of the A-chain. Several parts of the molecular surface differ significantly; some of them are quite near the active site cleft, and probably influence ribosome recognition. The positions of invariant active site residues remain the same, except the position of Tyr74. Two water molecules of hydrogen-bonded active site residues have been located in the active site cleft. Both of them may be responsible for hydrolyzing the N-C glycosidic bond. The current abrin-a structure is lactose free; this is probably essential for abrin-a crystallization. The B-chain is a glycoprotein, and the positions of several sugar residues of two sugar chains linked to earlier predicted glycosylation sites were determined. One of the sugar chains is a bridge between two neighboring molecules, since one of its mannose residues is connected to the galactose binding site of the neighboring molecule. Another sugar chain covers the surface of the B-chain.	abrus precatorius sugar

1	Identification of the potential active components of Abelmoschus manihot in rat blood and kidney tissue by microdialysis combined with ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry.In this paper, microdialysis combining with ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) was applied to simultaneously identify components in blood and kidney dialysis after oral administration of Abelmoschus manihot extract. Microdialysis probe was implanted in the jugular vein and the kidney medulla, respectively; microdialysis samples were collected continuously, transferred to microtubes and analyzed by UPLC-Q-TOF/MS. The components in microdialysis samples were separated by an UPLC HSS T3 column and eluted with acetonitrile and water (containing 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The results showed that unbound constituents in blood circulation of the rat include hyperoside, isoquercitrin, quercetin monoglucuronide, quercetin-3'-O-glucoside, quercetin, myricetin, and hibifolin while unbound constituents in kidney are hyperoside, isoquercitrin, quercetin monoglucuronide, which might be the potential active components in vivo. The developed method was simple and reliable, and could be adopted to rapidly screen and identify potential active components contributing to pharmacological effects of TCM and to better clarify its action mechanism.	abelmoschus manihot quercetin

1	Imaging cell wall architecture in single Zinnia elegans tracheary elements.The chemical and structural organization of the plant cell wall was examined in Zinnia elegans tracheary elements (TEs), which specialize by developing prominent secondary wall thickenings underlying the primary wall during xylogenesis in vitro. Three imaging platforms were used in conjunction with chemical extraction of wall components to investigate the composition and structure of single Zinnia TEs. Using fluorescence microscopy with a green fluorescent protein-tagged Clostridium thermocellum family 3 carbohydrate-binding module specific for crystalline cellulose, we found that cellulose accessibility and binding in TEs increased significantly following an acidified chlorite treatment. Examination of chemical composition by synchrotron radiation-based Fourier-transform infrared spectromicroscopy indicated a loss of lignin and a modest loss of other polysaccharides in treated TEs. Atomic force microscopy was used to extensively characterize the topography of cell wall surfaces in TEs, revealing an outer granular matrix covering the underlying meshwork of cellulose fibrils. The internal organization of TEs was determined using secondary wall fragments generated by sonication. Atomic force microscopy revealed that the resulting rings, spirals, and reticulate structures were composed of fibrils arranged in parallel. Based on these combined results, we generated an architectural model of Zinnia TEs composed of three layers: an outermost granular layer, a middle primary wall composed of a meshwork of cellulose fibrils, and inner secondary wall thickenings containing parallel cellulose fibrils. In addition to insights in plant biology, studies using Zinnia TEs could prove especially productive in assessing cell wall responses to enzymatic and microbial degradation, thus aiding current efforts in lignocellulosic biofuel production.	zinnia elegans polysaccharides
1	Phytochemical and biological activities of four wild medicinal plants.The fruits of four wild plants, namely, Capparis decidua, Ficus carica, Syzygium cumini, and Ziziphus jujuba, are separately used as traditional dietary and remedial agents in remote areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. The results of our study on these four plants revealed that the examined fruits were a valuable source of nutraceuticals and exhibited good level of antimicrobial activity. The fruits of these four investigated plants are promising source of polyphenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, and saponins. These four plants' fruits are good sources of iron, zinc, copper, manganese, selenium, and chromium. It was also observed that these fruits are potential source of antioxidant agent and the possible reason could be that these samples had good amount of phytochemicals. Hence, the proper propagation, conservation, and chemical investigation are recommended so that these fruits should be incorporated for the eradication of food and health related problems. 	ficus carica alkaloids

1	Isobutylhydroxyamides from the pericarp of Nepalese Zanthoxylum armatum inhibit NF1-defective tumor cell line growth.A neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-based bioassay-guided phytochemical investigation on Zanthoxylum armatum collected in Nepal led to the isolation of new timuramides A-D (1-4) and six known sanshools (5-10). The structures of all compounds were established by using modern spectroscopic techniques, including 1D and 2D NMR analysis and comparison with previously reported data. Most of the compounds inhibited growth of an Nf1- and p53-deficient mouse glioma cell line at noncytotoxic concentrations.	zanthoxylum armatum Isobutylhydroxyamides
1	Insecticidal and fumigant activities of Cinnamomum cassia bark-derived materials against Mechoris ursulus (Coleoptera: attelabidae).The insecticidal and fumigant activities of Cinnamomum cassia (Blume) bark-derived materials against the oak nut weevil (Mechoris ursulus Roelofs) were examined using filter paper diffusion and fumigation methods and compared to those of the commercially available Cinnamomum bark-derived compounds (eugenol, salicylaldehyde, trans-cinnamic acid, and cinnamyl alcohol). The biologically active constituent of the Cinnamomum bark was characterized as trans-cinnamaldehyde by spectroscopic analysis. In a test with the filter paper diffusion method, trans-cinnamaldehyde showed 100 and 83.3% mortality at rates of 2.5 and 1.0 mg/filter paper, respectively. At 2.5 mg/paper, strong insecticidal activity was produced from eugenol (90.0% mortality) and salicylaldehyde (88. 9%), whereas trans-cinnamic acid revealed moderate activity (73.3%). At 5 mg/paper, weak insecticidal activity (50.0%) was produced from cinnamyl alcohol. In a fumigation test, the Cinnamomum bark-derived compounds were much more effective against M. ursulus larvae in closed cups than in open ones. These results indicate that the insecticidal activity of test compounds was attributable to fumigant action, although there is also significant contact toxicity. As a naturally occurring insect-control agent, the Cinnamomum bark-derived materials described could be useful as a new preventive agent against damage caused by M. ursulus.

1	Analysis of volatile components, fatty acids, and phytosterols of Abies koreana growing in Poland.Extracts and essential oils from seeds as well as essential oils from cone scales and needles with twigs of the Abies koreana population were studied. An analysis of Korean fir essential oils allowed us to determine 147 volatile compounds. The identified compounds constituted 97-99% of the seed, cone and needle oils. The main volatile in the seed and needle oils was limonene (56.6% and 23.4%, respectively), while the predominant volatile in cone oils was alpha-pinene (51.2%). Korean fir seeds provided a rich source of both essential oil (3.8-8.5%) and extract, which was isolated with a 24.5% yield and contained numerous groups of fatty acids and phytosterols (414 microg/100g extract). The most prominent fatty acids were unsaturated, among which linoleic (41.2%) and oleic (31.2%) fatty acid were the main ones while the dominant sterols were isomers of ergostadienol and beta-sitosterol. A. koreana seeds, cones and needles are a source of many volatile bioactive compounds while the seed extract, with a pleasant scent, contained not only volatiles, but also fractions rich in fatty acids and phytosterols. These facts make A. koreana essential oils and especially the seed extract potential components of cosmetics.	a. koreana beta-sitosterol

3	Inhibitory effects of cinnamic acid on melanin biosynthesis in skin.Cinnamic acid is a wildly distributed phenylpropanoid component naturally occurring in plants, and is mainly found in Cinnamomum cassia BLUME and Panax ginseng. Cinnamic acid was recently reported to exert a tyrosinase inhibitory effect. However, research on melanocytes and animal bodies was not reported until now. In this study, we examined the effects of cinnamic acid on melanin biosynthesis within the melanocytes and brown guinea pigs. Melan-a cells were used to examine the effects of cinnamic acid in the melanocytes. Treatment with 100 ppm of cinnamic acid resulted in a significant reduction of melanin production in the melan-a cells at 29.0%. This compound also exhibited a potent inhibitory effect on tyrosinase activity and reduced tyrosinase expression in the melan-a cells. Moreover, cinnamic acid exhibited depigmenting activity on the UV-B-induced hyperpigmentation of brown guinea pig skin. Our results suggest that cinnamic acid might act as a skin whitening agent via inhibition of tyrosinase activity and expression within melanocytes.	cinnamic acid hyperpigmentation

1	Comparison of drip, pipe and surge spring root irrigation for Jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) fruit quality in the Loess plateau of China.Loess Plateau is a typical rain-fed farming region, facing the threat of drought. Irrigation method is among the most important factors affecting jujube quality. This study investigated the response of Ziziphus jujuba Mill. cv. Lizao quality to three different irrigation methods (drip-, pipe- and surge spring root irrigation) combining two water levels (20 m(3)/hm(2) and 120 m(3)/hm(2)). The effects of the trials were evaluated by taking into account the physical-chemical characteristics of jujubes and the antioxidant activity. Concomitant to this, the concentration of some taste-related (viz. glucose, fructose, TSS and malic acid) and health-related compounds/parameters (viz. catechin and epicatechin) were generally much greater in jujube fruit treated with drip irrigation (120 m(3)/hm(2)). Different irrigation treatments had no significant effects on antioxidant capacity, total phenolics and proanthocyanidins (except for pipe irrigation 20 m(3)/hm(2)). The best compromise between quality and irrigation of jujube fruit was achieved with drip irrigation (120 m(3)/hm(2)). 	jujube proanthocyanidins
2	Anthelmintic screening of Zimbabwean plants traditionally used against schistosomiasis.Extracts of 23 plant species used popularly against schistosomiasis in Zimbabwe were screened for their anthelmintic effect. Schistosomules of the trematode Schistosoma mansoni and cysticercoids of the cestode Hymenolepis diminuta were studied in vitro. The material consisted of 58 plant extracts, of which 37 killed the newly excysted cysticercoids within an hour, when incubated in a culture medium. Lethal concentrations varied from 0.8 to 103 mg/ml. All plant extracts showed activity against the tapeworms after 24 h. Ten of the best extracts were also tested against schistosomules. Five of these extracts showed activity. Lethal concentrations varied from 0.6 to 33.8 mg/ml of dry plant material. Extracts of stem and root from Abrus precatorius (Fabaceae), of root bark and leaves from Ozoroa insignis (Anacardiaceae) and of root bark from Zizyphus mucronata (Rhamnaceae) gave the best results against tapeworms. The best results against schistosomules were obtained with stem and root extracts from Abrus precatorius (Fabaceae) and stem bark from Elephantorrhiza goetzei (Mimosaceae). Although the activity of root and root bark extracts commonly used in traditional medicine was verified in this study, our results showed that also extracts from leaf and stem can be effective anthelmintics.	elephantorrhiza goetzei schistosomiasis
1	Evaluation of the antioxidant effects of Ziziphus mauritiana Lam. Leaf extracts against chronic ethanol-induced hepatotoxicity in rat liver.Chronic alcohol ingestion is known to increase the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby leading to liver damage. Antioxidant enzymes act individually or in combination to reduce or counter the effect of these ROS. Chronic administration of alcohol at (40% v/v, 1 ml/100 g), for 6 weeks showed a significant (p&lt;0.05) elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bilirubin (TB). There was also a significant (p&lt;0.05) decreased levels of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and superoxide dismutase compared to control rats. Pre-treatment of rats with 200, 400 mg/kg body weight of aqueous leaf extract of Ziziphus mauritiana or 100 mg/kg silymarin resulted in a significant (p&lt;0.05) decreased levels of ALT, AST, ALP, and TB with levels of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and superoxide dismutase showing a significant (p&lt;0.05) increase compared to group administered alcohol only. Histopathology of rat liver administered with alcohol only resulted in severe necrosis, mononuclear cell aggregation and fatty degeneration in the central and mid zonal areas which was a characteristic of a damaged liver. Pre-treatment with the aqueous extract of Ziziphus mauritiana or silymarin reduced the morphological changes that are associated with chronic alcohol administration. The presence of tannins, saponins and phenolic compounds observed in the plant extract could be responsible for the observed effects of decreasing the levels of injured tissue marker and lipid peroxidation.	ziziphus mauritiana alcohol
2	Protective effects of certain pharmaceutical compounds against abrin induced cell death in Jurkat cell line.Abrin is a plant glycoprotein toxin from the seeds of Abrus precatorius, and shares the structure and properties with ricin. Abrin is highly toxic, with an estimated human fatal dose of 0.1-1 mug/kg, causing death after accidental and intentional poisoning. It is a potent toxin warfare agent. There are no antidotes available for abrin intoxication. It is becoming increasingly important to develop countermeasures for abrin by developing pre- and post-exposure medical therapy. The present study involves the screening of certain pharmaceutical agents for their potential to counter abrin toxicity in Jurkat T lymphocytes and the probable mechanism of action of the compounds with protective effect. The compounds studied are: Prednisolone, Minocycline, Amifostine, DRDE-07 (amifostine analog), Melatonin, Ebselen, N-Acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) and Trolox. Among them, only NAC and trolox were found to confer significant protection in Jurkat cells by restoring antioxidant enzymes depleted by abrin treatment. Abrin also shown to increase in stress factor associated proteins SAPK/JNK, c-fos and c-jun levels which were effectively suppressed by NAC and trolox. In addition to this, both compounds significantly inhibit abrin induced inflammation and caspase-3 activity. These data suggest that NAC and trolox may serve as potential candidates for management of abrin-induced poisoning.	abrus precatorius death
1	Potentiation of antifungal activity of amphotericin B by essential oil from Cinnamomum cassia.The antifungal activity of the essential oil from Cinnamomum cassia, alone or combined with amphotericin B, a drug widely used for most indications despite side-effects was investigated. The composition of the oil was analysed by GC/MS and characterized by its very high content of cinnamaldehyde (92.2%). The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC 80%), used to evaluate the antifungal activity against Candida albicans, was determined by a macrobroth dilution method followed by a modelling of fungal growth. The essential oil of Cinnamomum cassia exhibited strong antifungal effect (MIC 80% = 0.169 microL/mL and K(aff) = 18,544 microL/mL). A decrease of the MIC 80% of amphotericin B was obtained when the culture medium contained essential oil concentrations ranging from 0.08 to 0.1 microL/mL. The strongest decrease (70%) was obtained when the medium contained 0.1 microL/mL of essential oil. This potentiation of amphotericin B obtained in vitro may show promise for the development of less toxic and more effective therapies especially for the treatment of HIV infection.	cinnamomum cassia cinnamaldehyde
1	Studies on the effects of essential-oil-based feed additives on performance, ileal nutrient digestibility, and selected bacterial groups in the gastrointestinal tract of piglets.The aim of this study was to assess the effects of 2 different phytogenic products on performance, ileal nutrient digestibility, and composition of the intestinal microbiota. The 2 phytogenic products contained different essential oil mixtures (EOM) characterized by either menthol (Mentha arvensis; EOM-M) or cinnamon aldehyde (Cinnamomum aromaticum; EOM-C) as main constituents. Three treatments consisted of control diet without EOM addition and diets supplemented with EOM-M or EOM-C. Reproducibility of the effects was examined in 4 trials with a total of 300 male castrated and female piglets weaned at 25 d of age. The number of pens per treatment in trials I through III were 7, 9, and 9, respectively, for research station conditions, and 10 in trial IV for simulated farm conditions. In research station conditions, the experimental unit consisted of flat deck pens with 2 piglets per pen, whereas it consisted of floor pens with straw bedding with 5 piglets per pen in farm conditions. The feed additives had no effect on feed intake or BW gain. Improvements (P &lt; 0.05) in G:F were observed for EOM-M supplemented diets in 2 of 4 trials as well as for the combined data of all trials. These improvements were associated with greater (P&lt;0.05) apparent ileal digestibility of CP and of most AA. The effect of EOM-C on these response criteria was intermediate between control and EOM-M. Real-time PCR analysis of the gastrointestinal contents for 7 bacterial groups (Lactobacillus spp., Enterococcus spp., Clostridium coccoides and Clostridium leptum cluster, Escherichia spp., and Escherichia coli toxin estII) indicated no effect of treatments on the gastrointestinal microbiota. It was concluded that EOM-M consistently improved feed efficiency in weaned piglets, and it was associated with improved ileal protein and AA digestibility. In general, however, the effectiveness of EOM as feed additives differs considerably depending on the constituents.	clostridium coccoides essential oil
1	Phytochemical and biological activities of four wild medicinal plants.The fruits of four wild plants, namely, Capparis decidua, Ficus carica, Syzygium cumini, and Ziziphus jujuba, are separately used as traditional dietary and remedial agents in remote areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. The results of our study on these four plants revealed that the examined fruits were a valuable source of nutraceuticals and exhibited good level of antimicrobial activity. The fruits of these four investigated plants are promising source of polyphenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, and saponins. These four plants' fruits are good sources of iron, zinc, copper, manganese, selenium, and chromium. It was also observed that these fruits are potential source of antioxidant agent and the possible reason could be that these samples had good amount of phytochemicals. Hence, the proper propagation, conservation, and chemical investigation are recommended so that these fruits should be incorporated for the eradication of food and health related problems. 	ficus carica saponins
1	Synthesis and in vitro cytotoxicity of cinnamaldehydes to human solid tumor cells.Cinnamaldehydes and related compounds were synthesized from various cinnamic acids based on the 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde isolated from the bark of Cinnamomum cassia Blume. The cytotoxicity to human solid tumor cells such as A549, SK-OV-3, SK-MEL-2, XF498 and HCT15 were measured. Cinnamic acid, cinnamates and cinnamyl alcohols did not show any cytotoxicity against the human tumor cells. Cinnamaldehydes and related compounds were resistant to A549 cell line up to 15 micrograms/ml. In contrast, HCT15 and SK-MEL-2 cells were much sensitive to these cinnamaldehyde analogues which showed ED50 values 0.63-8.1 micrograms/ml. Cytotoxicity of the saturated aldehydes was much weak compared to their unsaturated aldehydes. From these studies, it was found that the key functional group of the cinnamaldehyde-related compounds in the antitumor activity is the propenal group.	cinnamomum cassia cinnamaldehyde
1	Cinnamaldehyde inhibits the tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced expression of cell adhesion molecules in endothelial cells by suppressing NF-kappaB activation: effects upon IkappaB and Nrf2.The production of adhesion molecules and subsequent attachment of leukocytes to endothelial cells (ECs) are critical early events in atherogenesis. These adhesion molecules thus play an important role in the development of this disease. Recent studies have highlighted the chemoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of cinnamaldehyde, a Cinnamomum cassia Presl-specific diterpene. In our current study, we have examined the effects of both cinnamaldehyde and extracts of C. cassia on cytokine-induced monocyte/human endothelial cell interactions. We find that these compounds inhibit the adhesion of TNFalpha-induced monocytes to endothelial cells and suppress the expression of the cell adhesion molecules, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, at the transcriptional level. Moreover, in TNFalpha-treated ECs, the principal downstream signal of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, NF-kappaB, was also found to be abolished in a time-dependent manner. Interestingly, cinnamaldehyde exerts its anti-inflammatory effects by blocking the degradation of the inhibitory protein IkappaB-alpha, but only in short term pretreatments, whereas it does so via the induction of Nrf2-related genes, including heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1), over long term pretreatments. Treating ECs with zinc protoporphyrin, a HO-1 inhibitor, partially blocks the anti-inflammatory effects of cinnamaldehyde. Elevated HO-1 protein levels were associated with the inhibition of TNFalpha-induced ICAM-1 expression. In addition to HO-1, we also found that cinnamaldehyde can upregulate Nrf2 in nuclear extracts, and can increase ARE-luciferase activity and upregulate thioredoxin reductase-1, another Nrf2-related gene. Moreover, cinnamaldehyde exposure rapidly reduces the cellular GSH levels in ECs over short term treatments but increases these levels after 9 h exposure. Hence, our present findings indicate that cinnamaldehyde suppresses TNF-induced singling pathways via two distinct mechanisms that are activated by different pretreatment periods.	c. cassia diterpene
0	trans-Cinnamaldehyde Reverses Depressive-Like Behaviors in Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress Rats by Inhibiting NF-kappaB/NLRP3 Inflammasome Pathway.trans-Cinnamaldehyde (TCA) is the main active component extracted from Cinnamomum cassia (C. cassia), which has many pharmacological effects, such as anti-inflammation, lowering blood glucose, and improving nerve function. However, there is no report of TCA in the treatment of depression. The purpose of this study was to investigate the antidepressant-like effect of TCA and the mechanism of NF kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition by TCA. We divided 40 rats into the control group, CUMS group, FLU group, and the TCA group. The activation of the NF-kappaB pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of rats in each group was observed. After the treatments with FLU and TCA, the sucrose consumptions in rats increased significantly and the immobility time in forced swimming was decreased significantly compared to the CUMS group. The expression of TLR4, NF-kappaB-1, p-p65, TNF-alpha, NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, IL-1beta, and IL-18 proteins in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus was decreased, and the expression of IL-1beta, IL-18, and TNF-alpha in serum was downregulated compared to the CUMS group. Similar to FLU, TCA reverses the depression-like behaviors in rats, which indicates that TCA has a significant antidepressant-like effect. The mechanism of the antidepressant property of TCA might be that it inhibits the activation of the NF-kappaB pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of CUMS rats.

1	Optimization of the extraction conditions and quantification by RP-LC analysis of three alkaloids in Zanthoxylum nitidum roots.CONTEXT: A classic traditional Chinese medicine, Zanthoxylum nitidum (Roxb.) DC. widely used in China, exhibits anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antianalgesic activities. Alkaloids are one of the main bioactive components. It is urgent to develop a simple and reliable method to determine the main alkaloids in Z. nitidum roots. OBJECTIVE: To determine the three alkaloids in Z. nitidum roots, a reversed-phase liquid chromatographic (RP-LC) method combined with an optimum extraction condition was established. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A method involving four-factor-three-level orthogonal array design including the extracting solvent and the RP-LC condition was assayed. Twenty batches were collected from different areas of the Guangxi Province at different harvesting times. The determined alkaloids were nitidine chloride (NC, 1), ethoxychelerythrine (2) and liriodenine (3). The stable mobile phase was a C18 packing, and the mobile phase was acetonitril-aqueous phosphoric acid-triethylamine-buffer solution. RESULTS: The optimum extraction and detection conditions have been determined in the process of quantification of Z. nitidum root alkaloids. The three alkaloids were detected simultaneously in the 20 batches of samples. The results clearly showed that alkaloid concentrations differed significantly among Z. nitidum collected from various collection areas. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: We have established an optimum extraction and detection conditions in the process of quantification the three alkaloids in Z. nitidum roots. From this research, the most influenced factor on Z. nitidum roots was the collecting location, and the next factor was the harvesting time. The collecting location and the harvesting time should be considered as the high-quality medicinal herbs factors.	z. nitidum liriodenine
1	Effect of drying of jujubes (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) on the contents of sugars, organic acids, alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene, and phenolic compounds.This study investigated the changes in sugars, organic acids, alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene, phenolic profiles, total phenolic content (TPC), and antioxidant capacity of jujube fruits after four drying treatments (sun-, oven-, microwave- and freeze-drying). Sugar, organic acid, phenolic compounds, alpha-tocopherol, and beta-carotene were qualitatived and quantitatived by high-performance liquid chromatography. The TPC and antioxidant activity of jujube samples were evaluated using the Folin-Ciocalteau method and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical scavenging activity, respectively. Freeze-drying resulted in jujubes with higher antioxidant activity and was also a good choice for the preparation of beta-carotene from jujubes for the food industry. Microwave-dried jujubes had a higher content of protocatechuic acid, catechin, and epicatechin and maintained the same antioxidant capacity with the freeze-dried jujubes. The combination of microwave- and freeze-drying may be an efficient alternative with shorter processing time and, consequently, less impact on the nutritional value of the jujube.	jujube protocatechuic acid
1	Composition of essential oils from seeds of Abies koreana.The essential oils from seeds of nine Abies koreana specimens have been studied using GC-MS-FID and NMR methods, leading to the determination of 96 volatiles, which constituted over 99% of the oils. The hydrodistilled oils of fresh, resinous scent were isolated with yields in the range of 3.8-8.5%. The results showed that the essential oil of Korean fir seeds contained 70-95% monoterpenes and 1-20% oxygenated monoterpenes as the dominant groups. The numerous sesquiterpenes, diterpenes and their oxygenated derivatives constituted only 2-8% of the oil. The major component of the seed essential oil was limonene (41-72 g/100g); the laevorotary form of this terpene predominated. A. koreana seeds seem to be a rich source of both essential oil and (-)-limonene, whose average enantiomeric excess was above 95%.	a. koreana (-)-limonene
2	The flower extract of Abelmoschus manihot (Linn.) increases cyclin D1 expression and activates cell proliferation.Abelmoschus manihot (Linn.) is a medicinal herbal plant that is commonly used to treat chronic kidney disease and hepatitis. However, its effect on cell proliferation has not been clearly revealed. In this report, we sought to determine the effect of the flower extract of Amelmoschus manihot (FA) on cell proliferation. Based on our findings, FA increased the proliferation of human diploid fibroblast (HDF) and HEK293 cells. Through cell cycle analysis, FA was found to increase the number of HDF cells in the S phase and G2/M phase. FA also increased the expression of cyclin D1 and enhanced the migration of HDF cells. By administering FA to HDF cells with >=30 passages, a decrease in the number of senescence-associated beta galactosidase-positive cells was observed, thereby indicating that FA can ameliorate cellular senescence. Collectively, our findings indicate that FA increases cyclin D1 expression and regulates cell proliferation.	abelmoschus manihot hepatitis
3	The cardioprotective effect of total flavonoids on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion in rats.The flowers of Abelmoschus manihot (L.) Medic is a traditional Chinese medicine used for the treatment of ischemic diseases. The present study is to investigate whether total flavones (TA) of extracted from Abelmoschus manihot L. Medic has the potential cardioprotective effect on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) damage in rats. The index of myocardial injury, inflammatory biomarkers and NLRP3-related parameters were measured, respectively. The results demonstrated that compared to I/R group, TA reduced myocardial infarction area, declined serum creatinine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, attenuated serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1beta and tumour necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) production. Moreover, TA markedly enhanced the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and reduced the amounts of malondialdehyde (MDA) in I/R rats. In addition, TA reduced myocardial I/R induced injury in rats by inhibiting NLRPR3 inflammasome. Thus, it is assumed that TA could significantly improve myocardial I/R injury in rats partially through suppressing NLRP3 activtion.	flavonoids myocardial ischemia
1	Protective Effect of Selected Medicinal Plants against Hydrogen Peroxide Induced Oxidative Damage on Biological Substrates.Oxidative stress is developed due to susceptibility of biological substrates to oxidation by generation of free radicals. In degenerative diseases, oxidative stress level can be reduced by antioxidants which neutralize free radicals. Primary objective of this work was to screen four medicinal plants, namely, Andrographis paniculata, Costus speciosus, Canthium parviflorum, and Abrus precatorius, for their antioxidant property using two biological substrates-RBC and microsomes. The antioxidative ability of three solvent extracts, methanol (100% and 80%) and aqueous leaf extracts, was studied at different concentrations by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances method using Fenton's reagent to induce oxidation in the substrates. The polyphenol and flavonoid content were analyzed to relate with the observed antioxidant effect of the extracts. The phytochemical screening indicated the presence of flavonoids, polyphenols, tannins, and beta-carotene in the samples. In microsomes, 80% methanol extract of Canthium and Costus and, in RBC, 80% methanol extract of Costus showed highest inhibition of oxidation and correlated well with the polyphenol and flavonoid content. From the results it can be concluded that antioxidants from medicinal plants are capable of inhibiting oxidation in biological systems, suggesting scope for their use as nutraceuticals. 	andrographis paniculata flavonoid
1	In vitro activities of plant extracts on human Loa loa isolates and cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells.Loa loa, a filarial worm, can cause fatal encephalitis in humans. In an attempt to find alternatives to the standard treatments (ivermectin and diethylcarbamazine citrate), we tested 12 methanolic extracts of nine traditional plant remedies. The extracts (100-0.09 microg/ml) were incubated with 20 Loa loa microfilariae isolated from patients at 37 degrees C with 5% CO(2) in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal serum and antibiotics. Activity was evaluated 120 h later by counting live microfilariae under a microscope. Cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells was estimated by measuring 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2-5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide transformation to formazan at 450 nM in a spectrophotometer. The plants tested were Lophira alata, Greenwayodendron suaveolens, Uapaca togoensis, Zanthoxylum heitzii, Peperomia pellucida, Piptadeniastrum africanum, Petersianthus macrocarpus, Vernonia conferta, and Vernonia hymenolepis. Chemical screening showed that most of the extracts contained reducing sugars, tannin or polyphenols, sterols or triterpenes, saponosides, and alkaloids. None contained carotinoids and few contained flavonoids. The 50% lethal concentration ranged from 0.22 to 70.28 microg/ml, while the 50% inhibitory concentration for eukaryotic cells (IC(50)) ranged from 8.52 to 119.52 microg/ml. Extracts of P. macrocarpus (selectivity index = 72.16), P. africanum (13.69), Z. heitzii (12.11), and L. alata (9.26) were highly selective for L. loa.	p. macrocarpus flavonoids
2	A survey of some Indian medicinal plants for anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) activity.BACKGROUND &amp; OBJECTIVES: India has an extensive area of forest enriched with plant diversity. Several of these plants have been used as folklore medicines. However, the medicinal plants have rarely been investigated for anti-human immunodeficiency virus activity. Hence, some Indian medicinal plants were screened in vitro against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). METHODS: The inhibitory effect of plant extracts on HIV replication was monitored in terms of inhibition of virus induced cytopathogenicity in MT-4 cells. The MT-4 cells were infected with HIV. The HIV infected or mock infected MT-4 cells were incubated at 37 degrees C in a CO2 incubator in the presence of the plant extracts. After five days, cell viability was measured by tetrazolium based colorimetric assay. RESULTS &amp; INTERPRETATION: Of the 69 plant species screened, 16 were effective against HIV-1 and 4 were against both HIV-1 and HIV-2. The most effective extracts against HIV-1 and HIV-2 are respectively Cinnamomum cassia (bark) and Cardiospermum helicacabum (shoot + fruit). The findings provide a rationale for further studies on isolation of active principles and pharmacological evaluation.	cardiospermum helicacabum hiv-1 and hiv-2
3	[Oral health care by utilizing food function].We examined the effects of spices and herbs on Candida albicans to develop therapeutic tools against oral diseases such as oral candidiasis. C. albicans, a dimorphic fungus, is a component of the healthy human microbial flora. However, the excessive overgrowth of C. albicans causes oral candidiasis, and the symptoms, accompanied by severe inflammation, reduce the quality of life of elderly people. We found that spices such as clove (Syzygium aromaticum) and cassia (Cinnamomum aromaticum) exhibit inhibitory activity against Candida mycelial growth and show therapeutic efficacy in a murine oral candidiasis model. Our studies also demonstrated that the inhibitory activity of cinnamaldehyde was strengthened in parallel with a prolonged treatment time. Furthermore, when cinnamaldehyde in combination with methylcellulose was administered to the model mice, the therapeutic effect was potentiated. Here, we summarize up-to-date findings on how to use spices and herbs on a daily basis to improve or prevent oral problems such as oral candidiasis with the presentation of our recent data.	cinnamaldehyde oral candidiasis
3	Anthelmintic efficacy of cinnamaldehyde and cinnamic acid from cortex cinnamon essential oil against Dactylogyrus intermedius.Utilization of chemical pesticide to control monogenean diseases is often restricted in many countries due to the development of pesticide resistance and concerns of chemical residues and environmental contamination. Thus, the use of antiparasitic agents from plants has been explored as a possible way for controlling monogenean infections. Extracts from Cinnamomum cassia were investigated under in vivo conditions against Dactylogyrus intermedius in goldfish. The two bioactive compounds, cinnamaldehyde and cinnamic acid, were identified using nuclear magnetic resonance and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The 48 h median effective concentrations (EC(50)) for these compounds against D. intermedius were 0 57 and 6 32 mg L(-1), respectively. The LD(50) of cinnamaldehyde and cinnamic acid were 13 34 and 59 66 mg L(-1) to goldfish in 48 h acute toxicity tests, respectively. These data confirm that cinnamaldehyde is effective against D. intermedius, and the cinnamaldehyde exhibits potential for the development of a candidate antiparasitic agent.	cinnamic acid toxicity
3	(E)-4-(3,4-Dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-en-1-ol Enhances Melanogenesis through Increasing Upstream Stimulating Factor-1-Mediated Tyrosinase Expression.We investigated the potential melanogenic effect of compounds from Zingiber cassumunar Roxb. Our data revealed that chloroform-soluble extract of Z. cassumunar enhanced melanin synthesis in B16F10 melanoma cells. Among the components of the chloroform extract, (E)-4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-en-1-ol (DMPB) increased melanogenesis in both B16F10 cells and human primary melanocytes. In B16F10 cells, DMPB enhanced the activation of ERK and p38, and the level of tyrosinase. Although the level of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor was unchanged in DMPB-treated B16F10 cells, DMPB increased levels and nuclear localization of upstream stimulating factor-1 (USF1). Consistently, DMPB-mediated melanin synthesis was diminished in USF1-knockdown cells. Furthermore, DMPB induced hyperpigmentation in brown guinea pigs in vivo. Together, these data suggest that DMPB may promote melanin synthesis via USF1 dependent fashion and could be used as a clinical therapeutic agent against hypopigmentation-associated diseases.

1	A new geranylbenzofuranone from Zanthoxylum armatum.A new geranylbenzofuranone, zantholide (1), and eight known compounds, dodeca-2E,4E-dienoic acid isobutylamide (2), dodeca-2E,4E,8Z,11-tetraenoic acid isobutyl amide (3), zanthoxylin (4), sesamin (5), kobusin (6), asarinin (7), fargesin (8) and armatamide (9), have been isolated from the bark of Zanthoxylum armatum. The structures of the isolated compounds were determined on the basis of spectroscopic (1D, 2D NMR) and HR-ESI-MS data. This is the first report on the isolation of 2 and 3 from the Rutaceae family and 4 from Z. armatum.	z. armatum geranylbenzofuranone
2	Abrus abrin derived peptides induce apoptosis by targeting mitochondria in HeLa cells.In our previous study, Abrus abrin derived peptide fraction (ABP) with molecular weight in range of 600-1500Da was shown to have potent antitumor activity in Dalton's lymphoma (DL) tumor bearing mice. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the mechanism of mitochondrial apoptosis induced by the peptide fraction. ABP was found to have selective antiproliferative activity (10ng-100ng/ml) on several tumor cell lines in vitro without having any cytotoxic effect on normal cell lines with a dose of 1000ng/ml. Analysis of the growth inhibitory mechanism in HeLa cells revealed DNA fragmentation with appearance of the sub G(0)/G(1) peak indicative of apoptosis. Further investigation results showed that the apoptotic machinery of HeLa induced by ABP was associated with the release of reactive oxygen species, a drop in mitochondrial transmembrane potential, upregulation of Bax, downregulation of Bcl-2, and activation of caspase-3. The peptide fraction was found to target mitochondria of HeLa cells as observed by confocal microscopy. This peptide fraction offers a source of mitochondria penetrating peptides which might have therapeutic induction of apoptosis in cancer cells.	Abrus dalton's lymphoma
1	Differentiating parts of Cinnamomum cassia using LC-qTOF-MS in conjunction with principal component analysis.Cinnamon bark (Rou Gui in Chinese), cinnamon twig (Gui Zhi) and shaved cinnamon bark (Gui Sin) have been widely used as spices and in traditional Chinese medicine since ancient times. On-going issues related to quality and authenticity necessitate the development of analytical methods capable of providing an objective evaluation of samples. In this study, chemical fingerprints of cinnamon bark, cinnamon twigs and shaved cinnamon bark were established using liquid chromatography quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometry in conjunction with principal component analysis (PCA). From 125 samples of cinnamon, we identified the following eight compounds and their the detection ratios: coumarin, cinnamaldehyde, cinnamyl alcohol, cinnamic acid, 2-hydroxycinnamaldehyde, 2-hydroxycinnamic acid, 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde and 4-methoxycinnamaldehyde. Of these, 4-methoxycinnamaldehyde presented the largest variations in detection ratio, making up 64.0, 97.4 and 50.0% in cinnamon bark, cinnamon twig, and shaved cinnamon bark, respectively. The quantities of cinnamyl alcohol, coumarin and cinnamaldehyde also varied between the three parts of the plant. Chemical fingerprints of the three cinnamon samples were established using principal component analysis, the results of which indicate that cinnamon bark and shaved cinnamon bark could be easily differentiated, despite a marked similarity in outward appearance. Cinnamon twig was also shown to depart from the other clusters. The proposed method provides a fast and efficient means of identifying cinnamon herbs for quality control purposes.

1	In Vitro Incorporation of Radioiodinated Eugenol on Adenocarcinoma Cell Lines (Caco2, MCF7, and PC3).Recently, the synthesis of radiolabeled plant origin compounds has been increased due to their high uptake on some cancer cell lines. Eugenol (EUG), a phenolic natural compound in the essential oils of different spices such as Syzygium aromaticum (clove), Pimenta racemosa (bay leaves), and Cinnamomum verum (cinnamon leaf), has been exploited for various medicinal applications. EUG has antiviral, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory functions and several anticancer properties. The objective of this article is to synthesize radioiodinated (131I) EUG and investigate its effect on Caco2, MCF7, and PC3 adenocarcinoma cell lines. It is observed that radioiodinated EUG would have potential on therapy and imaging due to its notable uptakes in studied cells.	pimenta racemosa Eugenol
3	Cinnamomum cassia essential oil inhibits alpha-MSH-induced melanin production and oxidative stress in murine B16 melanoma cells.Essential oils extracted from aromatic plants exhibit important biological activities and have become increasingly important for the development of aromatherapy for complementary and alternative medicine. The essential oil extracted from Cinnamomum cassia Presl (CC-EO) has various functional properties; however, little information is available regarding its anti-tyrosinase and anti-melanogenic activities. In this study, 16 compounds in the CC-EO have been identified; the major components of this oil are cis-2-methoxycinnamic acid (43.06%) and cinnamaldehyde (42.37%). CC-EO and cinnamaldehyde exhibited anti-tyrosinase activities; however, cis-2-methoxycinnamic acid did not demonstrate tyrosinase inhibitory activity. In murine B16 melanoma cells stimulated with alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), CC-EO and cinnamaldehyde not only reduced the melanin content and tyrosinase activity of the cells but also down-regulated tyrosinase expression without exhibiting cytotoxicity. Moreover, CC-EO and cinnamaldehyde decreased thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS) levels and restored glutathione (GSH) and catalase activity in the alpha-MSH-stimulated B16 cells. These results demonstrate that CC-EO and its major component, cinnamaldehyde, possess potent anti-tyrosinase and anti-melanogenic activities that are coupled with antioxidant properties. Therefore, CC-EO may be a good source of skin-whitening agents and may have potential as an antioxidant in the future development of complementary and alternative medicine-based aromatherapy.	cinnamaldehyde melanoma
2	Evaluation of the phototoxic potential of plants used in oriental medicine.AIM OF THE STUDY: Phototoxicity can be either harmful or beneficial. Yet the phototoxicity of oriental medicinal plants is an understudied area. The purpose of this study is to fill in this gap. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The phototoxic potential of oriental medicinal plants was examined in vitro using photohemolysis and the Candida albicans test. Seventeen medicinal plants [Acorus gramineus (ACG), Panax ginseng C.A. (PAG), Platycodon grandiflorum (PLG), Aractylodes japonica (ATJ), Xanthium strumarium (XAS), Dioscorea batatas (DIB), Anemarrhena asphodeloides (ANA), Polygonatum sibiricum Red (PSR), Cocculus trilobus (COT), Ficus carica (FIC), Chelidonium majus var. asiaticum (CMA), Pulsatilla koreana (PUK), Agrimonia pilosa (AGP), Zanthoxylum schinifolium (ZAS), Angelica gigas (ANG), Ledebouriella seseloides (LES), and Cnidium officinale (CNO)] were selected because they showed strong fluorescence in one of our previous studies of 62 plants. We further evaluated in vivo phototoxicity in mice. 0.75 mL/kg of seed oil for Xanthium strumarium (XAS, ), or 1.25 mL/kg of extracted solutions of Atractylodes japonica (ATJ, ), Chelidonium majus var. asiaticum (CMA, ), Zanthoxylum schinifolium (ZAS, ), and Ledebouriella seseloides (LES, ) were given once, and evaluated for sunburn edema, formation of sunburn cell, decrease of epidermal Langerhans cells and local suppression of contact hypersensitivity by UVA irradiation. RESULTS: Sixteen out of the 17 plants tested except COT showed significant photohemolysis, and 5 of those exhibited phototoxic killing of Candida albicans. The phototoxicity of oriental medicines using those 5 plants was then studied in mice. The 5 plants increased sunburn edema and formation of sunburn cell, and suppressed immune responses locally by decreasing epidermal Langerhans cells and contact hypersensitivity by UVA irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: More than a quarter of oriental medicinal plants can be phototoxic, and strong fluorescence measured by absorption and fluorescence spectra can be an easier way to screen for phototoxicity. On the other hand, the phototoxicity of the plants may also be used therapeutically. Further studies regarding the phototoxicity of active components extracted from both live and dried oriental medicinal plants are necessary.	candida albicans sunburn edema
3	Antiproliferative Activity of Cinnamomum cassia Constituents and Effects of Pifithrin-Alpha on Their Apoptotic Signaling Pathways in Hep G2 Cells.Cinnamaldehyde (Cin), cinnamic acid (Ca) and cinnamyl alcohol (Cal), major constituents of Cinnamomum cassia, have been shown to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer and other activities. In this study, our aim was to evaluate the antiproliferative activity of these compounds in human hepatoma Hep G2 cells and examine the effects of pifithrin-alpha (PFTalpha; a specific p53 inhibitor) on their apoptotic signaling transduction mechanism. The antiproliferative activity was measured by XTT assay. Expression of apoptosis-related proteins was detected by western blotting. Results showed that at a concentration of 30 muM, the order of antiproliferative activity in Hep G2 cells was Cin &gt; Ca &gt; Cal. Cin (IC(50) 9.76 +- 0.67 muM) demonstrated an antiproliferative potency as good as 5-fluorouracil (an anti-cancer drug; IC(50) 9.57 +- 0.61 muM). Further studies on apoptotic mechanisms of Cin showed that it downregulated the expression of Bcl-(XL), upregulated CD95 (APO-1), p53 and Bax proteins, as well as cleaving the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in a time-dependent pattern. PFTalpha pre-incubation significantly diminished the effect of Cin-induced apoptosis. It markedly upregulated the anti-apoptotic (Bcl-(XL)) expression and downregulated the pro-apoptotic (Bax) expression, as well as effectively blocking the CD95 (APO-1) and p53 expression, and PARP cleavage in Cin-treated cells. This study indicates that Cin was the most potent antiproliferative constituent of C. cassia, and its apoptotic mechanism in Hep G2 cells could be mediated through the p53 induction and CD95 (APO-1) signaling pathways.

1	Dihydrobenzo[c]phenanthridine alkaloids from stem bark of Zanthoxylum nitidum.Five novel alkaloids, zanthomuurolanine ( 1), epi-zanthomuurolanine ( 2), zanthocadinanines A ( 3) and B ( 4), and epi-zanthocadinanine B ( 5), composed of dihydrochelerythrine and a cadinane-type sesquiterpene linked by a methylene bridge, have been isolated from stem bark of Zanthoxylum nitidum. These structures were elucidated by spectroscopic techniques (UV, IR, MS, CD, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, DEPT, COSY, NOESY, HSQC, and HMBC analyses). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies confirmed the relative configurations of 1 and 4 and provided additional support for the structures of 2, 3, and 5.	zanthoxylum nitidum sesquiterpene
1	Triterpenoids isolated from Zizyphus jujuba inhibit foam cell formation in macrophages.Because foam cell formation in macrophages is believed to play an essential role in the progression of early atherosclerotic lesions in vivo, prevention of foam cell formation is considered to be one of the major targets for the treatment of atherosclerosis. The present study examined the inhibitory effect of 50 crude plant extracts on foam cell formation. Among those crude extracts, Zizyphi Fructus (ZF) and Zizyphi Semen (ZS) extracts significantly inhibited the foam cell formation induced by acetylated LDL. Furthermore, triterpenoids such as oleanonic acid, pomolic acid, and pomonic acid were the major active compounds, and triterpenoids containing a carboxylic acid at C-28 play an important role in the inhibitory effect on foam cell formation in human macrophages. These data suggest that triterpenoids in Zizyphus jujuba , the plant source of ZF and ZS, may therefore be useful for the prevention of atherosclerosis.	zizyphus jujuba pomolic acid
1	Structural characterization and cytotoxic properties of an apiose-rich pectic polysaccharide obtained from the cell wall of the marine phanerogam Zostera marina.Zosterin, an apiose-rich pectic polysaccharide, was extracted and purified from the sea grass Zostera marina. Structural studies conducted by gas chromatography and NMR spectroscopy on a purified zosterin fraction (AGU) revealed a typical apiogalacturonan structure comprising an alpha-1,4-d-galactopyranosyluronan backbone substituted by 1,2-linked apiofuranose oligosaccharides and single apiose residues. The average molecular mass of AGU was estimated to be about 4100 Da with a low polydispersity. AGU inhibited proliferation of A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells with an approximate IC(50) value of 3 microg/mL (0.7 microM). In addition, AGU inhibited A431 cell migration and invasion. Preliminary experiments showed that inhibition of metalloproteases expression could play a role in these antimigration and anti-invasive properties. Autohydrolysis of AGU, which eliminated apiose and oligo-apiose substituents, led to a virtual disappearance of cytotoxic properties, thus suggesting a direct structure-function relationship with the apiose-rich hairy region of AGU.	zostera marina zosterin
2	Therapeutic potential of root and stem bark of wild medicinal plant Ziziphus mauritiana (Lamk.) against silica induced toxicity in Wistar albino rats.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ziziphus mauritiana (Lamk.) of the family Rhamnaceae is a traditional herbal medicinal plant commonly called as 'ber' (Indian jujube). It is traditionally used as food source and helps in treatment of various diseases like malaria, asthma, diarrhoea, typhoid, diabetes, skin diseases and acts as a pain killer. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to evaluate the ability of extracts of barks of root and stem of Ziziphus mauritiana (ZM) to cure silica induced toxicity in Wistar albino rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experiments carried out on the acute toxicity studies of silica and therapeutic potential of ZM extracts were based on OECD guidelines and from these results lethal dose (LD50) values were determined. Silica was administered by IP injection at 20 mg/kg b.w. for 10 days and roots and stem barks extracts of ZM were fed orally by gavage at 400 mg/kg b.w. for 21 days. Assessments of biochemical, haematological parameters as well as liver histological examination were performed in the study. RESULTS: After 21 days of oral feeding of extracts of root and stem of ZM, it was found to alter the liver histology. Significant decrease in enzymes such as ALT, AST, ALP, LDH and urea, creatinine and uric acid levels in serum were recorded. Treatment with extracts could help enzymatic activity of liver antioxidant enzymes to settle towards normal level and significant decrease in the lipid peroxidation along with increase in the value of GSH in liver, was also observed. In addition, extracts of ZM also helped to reduce the serum NO, IL-6 and TNF-alpha level. CONCLUSION: Results of this study has suggested that the extracts of root and stem bark of ZM can be used for therapeutic purpose to prevent silica induced toxicity. ZM extracts could be utilised as natural antioxidant and immunotherapeutic medicines to protect silica induced cell damage.	jujube diabetes
2	Dynamic changes of flavonoids in Abelmoschus manihot different organs at different growth periods by UPLC-MS/MS.Abelmoschus manihot (Linn.) Medicus has been clinically used to treat chronic kidney disease, oral ulcers, burns, and dysmenorrhea in China for many centuries. The major pharmacologically-active components of A. manihot are flavonoids. In this study, a rapid and highly sensitive UPLC-MS/MS analysis method was established and successfully applied to the simultaneous determination of five major flavonoids (rutin, hyperoside, isoquercitrin, quercetin, and myricetin) in different parts of A. manihot harvested at ten growth periods. Under the optimized chromatographic conditions, good separation for five target components was obtained on an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column within 18min. The total contents of the five investigated flavonoids in A. manihot roots, stems, leaves and flowers ranged from 2.86 to 123.7mug/g, 46.39 to 141.0mug/g, 929.4 to 3096mug/g, and 10,150 to 19,390mug/g, respectively, indicating that the total flavonoids in the four parts could be mainly arranged in a decreasing order as flower&gt;leaf&gt;stem&gt;root. The peak of total flavonoids in flowers and leaves appeared at G8 and G9, respectively. These results will be helpful for the determination of the suitable harvest time of A. manihot and the improvement of the utility value of the disused parts.	a. manihot dysmenorrhea
1	Analgesia Synergism of Essential Oil from Pericarp of Zanthoxylum schinifolium and Verapamil.Objective. To evaluate the synergistic analgesic effect of essential oil of Zanthoxylum schinifolium Sieb. et Zucc. (EOZ) and verapamil (Ver). Method. The qualitative and quantitative composition of EOZ were determined with gas chromatography/Mass spectrometer. The interaction between EOZ and Ver in antinociceptive activity was evaluated by using acetic acid-induced writhing, hot plate, and tail flick tests in mice and in isolated toad sciatic nerve test. Results. Linalool, limonene, and sabinene are the major components of EOZ. EOZ (middle-dose: 40 mg kg(-1), high-dose: 80 mg kg(-1)) and EOZ + Ver (Each dose group) have remarkable analgesic effects on pain in mice induced by acetic acid-induced writhing, hot plate, and tail flick tests. Low-dose EOZ (20 mg kg(-1)) had no analgesic action, but when it is combined with Ver it has shown significant antinociception. Verapamil has a faint analgesic effect but was not able to inhibit action potential transmission in toad sciatic nerve. EOZ (0.2%) and EOZ + Ver (0.2% + 0.05%) also inhibited action potential transmission in toad sciatic nerve. Combination of EOZ with Ver had a greater analgesic effect and inhibition of nerve action potential transmission compared to its components EOZ and Ver. Conclusion. The combination of EOZ with Ver produces a synergistic analgesic effect. 	zanthoxylum schinifolium sabinene
1	Cytotoxic mannopyranosides of indole alkaloids from Zanthoxylum nitidum.Three new mannopyranosides of indole alkaloids, methyl 7-(beta-D-mannopyranosyloxy)-1H-indole-2-carboxylate (1), methyl 7-[(3-O-acetyl-beta-D-mannopyranosyl)oxy]-1H-indole-2-carboxylate (2), and 2-methyl-1H-indol-7-yl beta-D-mannopyranoside (3), were isolated from an EtOH extract of the roots of Zanthoxylum nitidum. Their structures were identified as new compounds on the basis of the spectroscopic analyses. Bioactivity evaluation revealed that these alkaloids possess significant cytotoxicities against all the tested tumor cell lines with IC50 values of less than 30 muM. 	zanthoxylum nitidum indole alkaloids
3	In Vitro Incorporation of Radioiodinated Eugenol on Adenocarcinoma Cell Lines (Caco2, MCF7, and PC3).Recently, the synthesis of radiolabeled plant origin compounds has been increased due to their high uptake on some cancer cell lines. Eugenol (EUG), a phenolic natural compound in the essential oils of different spices such as Syzygium aromaticum (clove), Pimenta racemosa (bay leaves), and Cinnamomum verum (cinnamon leaf), has been exploited for various medicinal applications. EUG has antiviral, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory functions and several anticancer properties. The objective of this article is to synthesize radioiodinated (131I) EUG and investigate its effect on Caco2, MCF7, and PC3 adenocarcinoma cell lines. It is observed that radioiodinated EUG would have potential on therapy and imaging due to its notable uptakes in studied cells.	Eugenol cancer
1	Inhibitory effect of 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde on nitric oxide production through inhibition of NF-kappa B activation in RAW 264.7 cells.Cinnamomum cassia has been widely used for treating dyspepsia, gastritis, and inflammatory disease. In the present study, several of cinnamaldehyde derivatives were synthesized from various cinnamic acid based on the 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde isolated from the bark C. cassia Blume was investigated to compare their NO production and NF-kappa B activity from Raw 264.7 cell since nitric oxide (NO) and NF-kappa B have been shown to be implicated factors in the inflammatory disease. The results show that HCA, among the derivatives, most significantly inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NO production and NF-kappa B transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner with an IC(50) value of 8 and 22 microM, respectively. We next investigated putative possible mechanisms of inhibitory effect of HCA on NO production. The inhibition of NO by HCA was consistent with the inhibitory effect on LPS-induced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression. Moreover, HCA inhibited LPS-induced p50 and p65 translocation resulting in the inhibition of the DNA binding activity of the NF-kappa B, a central regulator of iNOS. The present results provided evidence that HCA, among cinnamaledhyde derivatives, has the most inhibitory effect on NO production through inhibition of NF-kappa B activation, and thus can be used as an anti-inflammatory agent.	c. cassia cinnamic acid
3	Combined treatment with Cinnamaldehyde and beta-TCP had an additive effect on bone formation and angiogenesis in critical size calvarial defect in ovariectomized rats.Accumulating evidence suggests that improvements in osteogenesis and angiogenesis play an important role in repairing osteoporotic bone defects. Cinnamomum cassia (C. cassia), a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, is reported to show anabolic effects on osteoblasts. However, whether C. cassia could actually repair bone defects in osteoporotic conditions remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of combined treatment with Cinnamaldehyde (main oil isolated from the C. cassia) and beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP) on bone formation and angiogenesis in critical size calvarial defects in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Using a previously established OVX model, 5 mm critical size calvarial defect was established in OVX rats. All OVX rats were then randomly divided into OVX group (OVX rats + empty defect), TCP group (OVX rats + beta-TCP), and CTCP group (Cinnamaldehyde 75 mg/kg/day for 12 weeks + beta-TCP). Twelve weeks after treatment, according to Micro-CT and HE staining, combination of Cinnamaldehyde and beta-TCP had an additive effect on bone regeneration compared with other groups (p &lt; 0.05). Based on dynamic fluorochrome-labelling analysis, Cinnamaldehyde+beta-TCP continuously promoted new bone mineralization compared with other groups at each time point (p &lt; 0.05). Microfil perfusion suggested that CTCP group showed more neovascularization compared with other groups (p &lt; 0.05). Immunohistochemical assay supported the findings that Cinnamaldehyde+beta-TCP enhanced expression of OCN, VEGF and CD31. The present study demonstrated that combined treatment with Cinnamaldehyde and beta-TCP promoted bone formation and angiogenesis in osteoporotic bone defects, which provides a promising new strategy for repairing bone defects in osteoporotic conditions.

1	Pressurized liquid extraction and GC-MS analysis for simultaneous determination of seven components in Cinnamomum cassia and the effect of sample preparation.A pressurized liquid extraction and GC-MS method was developed for simultaneous quantitative determination of the seven components, including cinnamaldehyde, copaene, cinnamic acid, coumarin, 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde, 2-methoxycinnamic acid and safrole in Cinnamomum cassia. The results showed that methanol and ethanol was not available for extraction of cinnamaldehyde and 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde due to aldol reaction. The developed method was validated to be sensitive, accurate and simple, and was successfully employed for the analysis of 15 samples of C. cassia. The contents of the investigated components were significantly variant and cinnamaldehyde is the most abundant compound, but safrole was not detected in all samples.	c. cassia safrole
2	In vitro antimicrobial activity of extracts from plants used traditionally in South Africa to treat tuberculosis and related symptoms.Respiratory ailments are major human killers, especially in developing countries. Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease causing a threat to human healthcare. Many South African plants are used in the traditional treatment of TB and related symptoms, but there has not been a sufficient focus on evaluating their antimicrobial properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of plants used traditionally to treat TB and related symptoms against microorganisms (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Mycobacterium aurum A+) associated with respiratory infections using the microdilution assay. Ten plants were selected based on a survey of available literature of medicinal plants used in South Africa for the treatment of TB and related symptoms. The petroleum ether, dichloromethane, 80% ethanol, and water extracts of the selected plants were evaluated for antibacterial activity. Out of 68 extracts tested from different parts of the 10 plant species, 17 showed good antimicrobial activities against at least one or more of the microbial strains tested, with minimum inhibitory concentration ranging from 0.195 to 12.5 mg/mL. The good antimicrobial properties of Abrus precatorius, Terminalia phanerophlebia, Indigofera arrecta, and Pentanisia prunelloides authenticate their traditional use in the treatment of respiratory diseases. Thus, further pharmacological and phytochemical analysis is required.	indigofera arrecta respiratory diseases
2	Stimulating activity of Chinese medicinal herbs on human lymphocytes in vitro.The effects of eight kinds of Chinese medicinal herbs (CMH) on human lymphocytes was studied in vitro. The extract of Cinnamomum cassia presl markedly stimulated human lymphocytes to proliferate. Codonopsis pilosula, Oldenlandia diffusa and Rhizoma typhonii weakly stimulated. These extracts enhanced cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) activity, but failed to enhance natural killer (NK)-cell activity. The extracts of these CMHs have stimulatory effect on immunoglobulin (Ig) production by B-cells and interleukin(IL)-1 production by monocytes. These activities of Cinnamomun cassia presl extract are associated with glycoproteins, whose molecular weight was about 100 KDa. These results suggest that CMH extracts have a stimulating activity on human lymphocytes and these abilities could be used clinically for the treatment of diseases such as cancer.	cinnamomum cassia cancer
1	Analysis of volatile components, fatty acids, and phytosterols of Abies koreana growing in Poland.Extracts and essential oils from seeds as well as essential oils from cone scales and needles with twigs of the Abies koreana population were studied. An analysis of Korean fir essential oils allowed us to determine 147 volatile compounds. The identified compounds constituted 97-99% of the seed, cone and needle oils. The main volatile in the seed and needle oils was limonene (56.6% and 23.4%, respectively), while the predominant volatile in cone oils was alpha-pinene (51.2%). Korean fir seeds provided a rich source of both essential oil (3.8-8.5%) and extract, which was isolated with a 24.5% yield and contained numerous groups of fatty acids and phytosterols (414 microg/100g extract). The most prominent fatty acids were unsaturated, among which linoleic (41.2%) and oleic (31.2%) fatty acid were the main ones while the dominant sterols were isomers of ergostadienol and beta-sitosterol. A. koreana seeds, cones and needles are a source of many volatile bioactive compounds while the seed extract, with a pleasant scent, contained not only volatiles, but also fractions rich in fatty acids and phytosterols. These facts make A. koreana essential oils and especially the seed extract potential components of cosmetics.	a. koreana linoleic
1	Inhibitory effect of ailanthoidol on 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate-induced tumor promotion in mouse skin.Many components derived from dietary or medicinal plants showing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential have been found to possess chemopreventive properties. In our previous study, we achieved the total synthesis of ailanthoidol (AT), a neolignan from Zanthoxylum ailanthoides or Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, which are used in Chinese traditional herbal medicine. In the present study, preliminarily, AT exhibited a radical quenching property by DPPH assay. Following this, we assessed the effect of AT on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced oxidative stress and inflammation in female CD-1 mouse skin which was closely linked to tumor promotion. The topical application of AT (0.5-2.5 mM; 200 microl) reduced the formation of hydrogen peroxide and inhibited the myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in the mouse skin when compared with that of the TPA-treated alone group. In addition, AT presented a suppression effect on the TPA-induced hyperplasia and leukocyte infiltration in the epidermis and edema of mouse ears. Furthermore, it showed that AT inhibited the TPA-induced expression of COX-2 protein and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity in epidermis. Finally, AT was evaluated for its ability to inhibit the TPA-induced promotion in skin tumors of female CD-1 mice. Topical application of AT 5 min prior to TPA (5 nmol) three times weekly for 12 weeks to mice which were initiated with benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) inhibited the incidence of skin tumors in mice and the average number of tumors per mice as compared to TPA-treated alone. These results indicate that AT possesses potential as a chemopreventive agent against tumor promotion.	zanthoxylum ailanthoides AT
1	In vitro activities of plant extracts on human Loa loa isolates and cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells.Loa loa, a filarial worm, can cause fatal encephalitis in humans. In an attempt to find alternatives to the standard treatments (ivermectin and diethylcarbamazine citrate), we tested 12 methanolic extracts of nine traditional plant remedies. The extracts (100-0.09 microg/ml) were incubated with 20 Loa loa microfilariae isolated from patients at 37 degrees C with 5% CO(2) in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal serum and antibiotics. Activity was evaluated 120 h later by counting live microfilariae under a microscope. Cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells was estimated by measuring 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2-5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide transformation to formazan at 450 nM in a spectrophotometer. The plants tested were Lophira alata, Greenwayodendron suaveolens, Uapaca togoensis, Zanthoxylum heitzii, Peperomia pellucida, Piptadeniastrum africanum, Petersianthus macrocarpus, Vernonia conferta, and Vernonia hymenolepis. Chemical screening showed that most of the extracts contained reducing sugars, tannin or polyphenols, sterols or triterpenes, saponosides, and alkaloids. None contained carotinoids and few contained flavonoids. The 50% lethal concentration ranged from 0.22 to 70.28 microg/ml, while the 50% inhibitory concentration for eukaryotic cells (IC(50)) ranged from 8.52 to 119.52 microg/ml. Extracts of P. macrocarpus (selectivity index = 72.16), P. africanum (13.69), Z. heitzii (12.11), and L. alata (9.26) were highly selective for L. loa.	p. africanum carotinoids
1	Alkaloids from the roots of Zanthoxylum nitidum and their antiviral and antifungal effects.Five alkaloids, 5,6-dihydro-6-methoxynitidine (1), dictamnine (2), gamma-fagarine (3), skimmianine (4), and 5-methoxydictamnine (5), were isolated from the roots of Zanthoxylum nitidum. Their structures and configurations were elucidated by spectroscopic methods and X-ray analysis. Compounds 1, 4, and 5 showed in vitro antiviral effect against hepatitis B virus, and compounds 2, 3, and 5 demonstrated marked antimitotic and antifungal activity.	zanthoxylum nitidum alkaloids
1	Variability of phenolic and alkaloid content in different plant parts of Carissa edulis Vahl and Zanthoxylum chalybeum Engl.OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to investigate the relative abundance and effect of post-harvest treatment on total phenolics (TP) and total alkaloids in the leaves and bark of Carissa edulis and Zanthoxylum chalybeum, which would give an indication of the suitability of leaves as alternative sources of medicine in these plant species. RESULTS: Results indicated higher levels of total phenolics than total alkaloids in both of the species under both freezing and air drying conditions. While more alkaloids were found in leaves compared to bark, there was no difference in abundance of phenols between the plant parts of both species. Air drying preserved more TPs than freezing and the opposite was true for alkaloids. For sustainability, leaves are recommended as an alternative source of medicine instead of the preferred root or stem bark. However, the choice of whether to dry or freeze will depend on the specific compound of interest. Assessment of spatial variability of medicinal properties is highly recommended.	zanthoxylum chalybeum alkaloids
1	Integrated pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of multiple flavonoid C-glycosides components in rat after oral administration of Abrus mollis extract and correlations with bio-effects.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Abrus mollis, a commonly used traditional Chinese medicine in China and other Asia countries, has been used clinically to prevent and treat hepatitis and alcoholic liver disease for decades. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A modified HPLC-MS method was developed for the determination of vicenin-2 (AM-I), isoschaftoside (AM-II), and schaftoside (AM-III) of AM extract (AME) in rat plasma and tissues (heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys). Following oral administration of AME to rat at a dose of 200mg/kg, the concentrations of AM-I, II and III in plasma and tissues were quantified. An integrated double peak pharmacokinetics model was used to fit the concentration-time curves. The effects of drug on the bile flow and toe swelling of rats induced by carrageenan were also studied. RESULTS: The limit of quantitation of this modified HPLC-MS method decreased from 25 to 5ng/mL for plasma and from 100 to 10ng/g for tissue. These concentration-time curves show two successive maximum concentrations. The results of integrated double peak pharmacokinetics in this paper indicated that the three flavonoid C-glycosides may be absorbed by two sites of intestine in vivo. These results of bile flow and toe swelling showed a significant correlation between the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. CONCLUSIONS: The novel integrated double peak pharmacokinetic approach to studying the holistic pharmacokinetic properties of traditional Chinese medicine has been successfully developed and validated using AM as a model drug. This study would be a useful guide for the holistic double peak pharmacokinetic study in consistence with the intrinsic theory and characteristics of traditional Chinese medicine.	abrus mollis flavonoid c-glycosides

C29H34O16, m.p. 260-262 degrees C, [M]+ 638 (EIMS) was separated from the chloroform soluble fraction of the concentrated 80% methanolic extract of the seeds of Abrus precatorius (Linn). It was characterised as a new biologically active flavonol glycoside 7,3',5'-trimethoxy-4'-hydroxy flavone-3-O-beta-D-galactosyl-(l --&gt; 4)-alpha-L-xyloside (1) by several colour reactions, spectral analysis and chemical degradations.	abrus precatorius flavonol glycoside
2	How does traditional knowledge of Cassiae semen shed light on weight management? - A classical and modern literature review.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The seed of Senna obtusifolia (L.) H. S. Irwin & Barneby (Cassiae semen, CS) also known as Jue ming zi in China, has been traditionally used for weight management by purging the liver and improving the liver functions to support digestion. In the past decades, it has been used for hepatoprotection and treatment of overweight and other metabolic disorders such as hyperlipidaemia and diabetes. AIM OF THE REVIEW: This review aimed at providing comprehensive information on the traditional usages, pharmacology, phytochemistry and toxicology of CS and critically exploring its potential usage for clinical weight management from both traditional and modern application perspectives. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In order to fully understand the properties, actions and indications of CS, two sets of Chinese classical texts were searched, namely: Zhong Hua Yi Dian (Encyclopaedia of Traditional Chinese Medicine) and Zhong Guo Ben Cao Quan Shu (Complete Collection of Traditional Texts on Chinese Materia Medica). The purpose of studying these classical texts was to determine the traditional use of CS in weight management. Comprehensive searches were also performed on seven databases for publications on original randomised clinical trials (RCT), in vivo, in vitro or in silico studies related to pharmacological effects of CS. Detailed information about the phytochemistry of CS was collected from books, encyclopedia, online databases and journal literature. FINDINGS: In classical literature review, 89 classic texts provided information of properties, actions and indications of CS. In modern literature review, 44 studies were included for analysis, including 5 RCTs, 7 in vivo studies, 14 in vitro studies, 2 in silico studies and 16 studies of mixed types. Chinese classic literature has provided traditional evidence of the usage of CS for weight management. Contemporary studies have revealed that CS has weight loss effects and possesses some other pharmacological activities supporting weight management. Some chemical compounds of CS have been hypothesised to have a direct or indirect contribution to weight control. CONCLUSIONS: The relationships between chemical compounds and the corresponding weight-loss target proteins are not fully understood. Therefore, CS constituents should be further explored for the development of novel therapeutic or preventive agents for the treatment of overweight and obesity.	senna obtusifolia (l.) h. s. irwin & barneby hyperlipidaemia and diabetes
2	Immunomodulatory and anti-tumor activities of native and heat denatured Abrus agglutinin.Abrus agglutinin (AAG), a hetero tetrameric gal beta (1-3) NAc gal specific lectin, is isolated from seeds of Abrus precatorius. In our previous studies we found that the protein could act as an immunomodulator and immunoadjuvant in native (NA) and heat denatured (HDA) conditions. An anticancer effect of the lectin is reported, but its mode of action is not clearly known. In the present study, the anti-tumor activity of AAG (NA, HDA) has been evaluated in a murine Dalton's lymphoma (DL) ascites tumorogenic model. We found that treatment with both NA and HDA were able to decrease the tumor cell number in vivo and significantly increased median survival time. In vitro studies showed that AAG (NA, HDA) treatment of Dalton's lymphoma ascites cells (DLAC) resulted in growth inhibition at the concentration of 1 microg/ml and above. Whereas, AAG (NA, HDA) at much lower concentrations (approximately 1 ng/ml) can stimulate peritoneal macrophage and spleen derived NK cells in vitro demonstrating cytotoxicity against DLAC. Cell cycle analysis showed an increased number of cells in Sub-G0/G1 phase for in vitro and in vivo treatments. In summary, AAG (NA, HDA) at non-toxic concentration was able to elicit anti-tumor effects in DL bearing mice by stimulating the innate immune system and Th1 type immunomodulation.	abrus precatorius dalton's lymphoma ascites
4	Improvement of insulin sensitivity in obese Zucker rats by myricetin extracted from Abelmoschus moschatus.In an attempt to develop new substances for treating insulin resistance, obese Zucker rats were employed to screen the effect of myricetin, an active principle of Abelmoschus moschatus (Malvaceae), on insulin resistance. Myricetin purified from the aerial portion of the plant was administered intravenously ( I. V.) into animals. A dose-dependent decrease in the plasma glucose concentration of obese Zucker rats was observed 30 min following an I. V. injection. Moreover, repeated I. V. injection of myricetin (1 mg/kg) into obese Zucker rats 3 times daily for 1 week reduced the value of the glucose-insulin index, an index of insulin resistance calculated from the areas under the curve of glucose and insulin during the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test. Additionally, repeated myricetin treatments overturned the inability of insulin to increase the expression of glucose transporter subtype 4 (GLUT 4) and to increase the protein levels and phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) in soleus muscle of these obese rats. The inability of insulin to increase expression of the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) and to promote Akt serine phosphorylation in soleus muscle of these rats were also overturned by repeated myricetin treatments. These findings indicate that myricetin improves insulin sensitivity through increased post-receptor insulin signaling mediated by enhancements in IRS-1-associated PI3-kinase and GLUT 4 activity in muscles of obese Zucker rats. Myricetin might be used as a model substance for the development of antidiabetic compounds.	glucose-insulin glut 4
2	Toxicological interactions of Abrus precatorius and Cassia senna in the diet of Lohmann broiler chicks.The combination of 0.5% Abrus precatorius seed and 2% Cassia senna fruit in the diet of Lohmann broiler chicks caused severe lesions, reduced weight gain, inefficient feed utilization and anemia. Organ lesions correlated with changes in clinical chemistry and hematology. Tissue recovery was not complete 2 w following withdrawal of the test diet. Feeding 0.5% Abrus or 2% Senna diets alone produced decreased growth and tissue lesions that did not return to normal 2 w following return to normal rations.	cassia senna anemia
1	Metabolism of hibifolin by human intestinal bacteria.Hibifolin, the highest-content bioactive flavonoid of the flowers of Abelmoschus manihot, was incubated with human intestinal bacteria, and four metabolites (1-4) were obtained from the incubated solution by chromatographic methods. The structures of the four metabolites were elucidated as gossypetin 8-O-beta-D-4''-deoxy- Delta(4'')-glucuropyranoside (1), gossypetin (2), quercetin (3), and 8-methoxy-quercetin (4), respectively, on the basis of UV, NMR, and MS data. Metabolite 1 was obtained as a new compound with a specific beta-D-4''-deoxy-Delta(4'')-glucuropyranosyl moiety, which was formed through a unique and novel metabolic pathway that has not been reported previously.	abelmoschus manihot Hibifolin
1	Isolation of substances with antiproliferative and apoptosis-inducing activities against leukemia cells from the leaves of Zanthoxylum ailanthoides Sieb. &amp; Zucc.Extraction of the leaves of Zanthoxylum ailanthoides Sieb. &amp; Zucc. affords extracts and four isolated compounds which exhibit activities against leukemia cells. The chloroform-soluble fraction (ZAC) of the crude extract of this plant showed cytotoxic activity against human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) and myelomonocytic leukemia (WEHI-3) cells with IC(50) values of 73.06 and 42.22 mug/mL, respectively. The active ZAC was further separated to yield pheophorbide-a methyl ester (1), pheophorbide-b methyl ester (2), 13(2)-hydroxyl (13(2)-S) pheophorbide-a methyl ester (3) and 13(2)-hydroxyl (13(2)-R) pheophorbide-b methyl ester (4) whose structures were confirmed by spectroscopic methods. Compounds 2-4 showed cytotoxic activities against both leukemia cells with IC(50) value in the range of 46.76-79.43 nM, whereas compound 1 exhibited only weak cytotoxic activity. The extracts and compounds 1-4 also induced apoptosis and DNA damage in leukemia cells after treatment. The results suggested that the Z. ailanthoides is biologically active against leukemia cells.	z. ailanthoides 13(2)-hydroxyl (13(2)-r) pheophorbide-b methyl ester
1	Hydrophilic interaction ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry for determination of nucleotides, nucleosides and nucleobases in Ziziphus plants.In this study, a rapid and sensitive analytical method was developed for the determination of 20 nucleobases, nucleosides and nucleotides in Ziziphus plants at trace levels by using hydrophilic interaction ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC-UHPLC-TQ-MS/MS) in multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. Under the optimized chromatographic conditions, good separation for 20 target compounds were obtained on a UHPLC Amide column with sub-2mum particles within 10min. The overall LODs and LOQs were between 0.11-3.12ngmL(-1) and 0.29-12.48ngmL(-1) for the 20 analytes, respectively. It is the first report about simultaneous analysis of nucleobases, nucleosides and nucleotides in medicinal plants using HILIC-UHPLC-TQ-MS/MS method, which affords good linearity, precision, repeatability and accuracy. The developed method was successfully applied to Ziziphus plant (Z. jujuba, Z. jujuba var. spinosa and Z. mauritiana) samples. The analysis showed that the fruits and leaves of Ziziphus plants are rich in nucleosides and nucleobases as well as nucleotides, and could be selected as the healthy food resources. Our results in present study suggest that HILIC-UHPLC-TQ-MS/MS method could be employed as a useful tool for quality assessment of the samples from the Ziziphus plants as well as other medicinal plants or food samples using nucleotides, nucleosides and nucleobases as markers. 	z. jujuba var Amide
1	Antimicrobial effect against different bacterial strains and bacterial adaptation to essential oils used as feed additives.The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity and determine the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the essential oils derived from Origanum vulgare (oregano), Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree), Cinnamomum cassia (cassia), and Thymus vulgaris (white thyme) against Salmonella Typhimurium, Salmonella Enteritidis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. The study also investigated the ability of these different bacterial strains to develop adaptation after repetitive exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of these essential oils. The MBC of the essential oils studied was determined by disc diffusion and broth dilution methods. All essential oils showed antimicrobial effect against all bacterial strains. In general, the development of adaptation varied according to the bacterial strain and the essential oil (tea tree &gt; white thyme &gt; oregano). Therefore, it is important to use essential oils at efficient bactericidal doses in animal feed, food, and sanitizers, since bacteria can rapidly develop adaptation when exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of these oils. 	oregano essential oils
1	Chemical composition of the volatile oil from Zanthoxylum avicennae and antimicrobial activities and cytotoxicity.BACKGROUND: Through literature retrieval, there has been no report on the research of the chemical components in Zanthoxylum avicennae (Lam.) DC. This paper extracted and determined the chemical components of the volatile oil in Z. avicennae, and at the same time, measured and evaluated the bioactivity of the volatile oil in Z. avicennae. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We extract the volatile oil in Z. avicennae by steam distillation method, determined the chemical composition of the volatile oil by GC-MS coupling technique, and adopt the peak area normalization method to measured the relative percentage of each chemical composition in the volatile oil. Meanwhile, we use the Lethal-to-prawn larva bioactivity experiment to screen the cytotoxicity activities of the volatile oil in Z. avicennae, and using the slanting test-tube experiment to determine and evaluate its antibacterial activities in vitro for the eight kinds of plant pathogenic fungi in the volatile oil of the Z. avicennae. RESULTS: The results show that 68 kinds of compounds are determined from the volatile oil of Z. avicennae. The determined part takes up 97.89% of the total peak area. The main ingredients in the volatile oil of Z. avicennae are sesquiterpenoids and monoterpene. The test results show that the volatile oil in Z. avicennae has strong antibacterial activities and cytotoxicity, with the strongest antibacterial activity against the Rhizoctonia solani AG1-1A. CONCLUSION: This research results will provide reference data for understanding the chemical composition of the volatile oil in the aromatic plant of Z. avicennae and its bioactivity, and for its further development and application.	z. avicennae sesquiterpenoids
1	In vitro activities of plant extracts on human Loa loa isolates and cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells.Loa loa, a filarial worm, can cause fatal encephalitis in humans. In an attempt to find alternatives to the standard treatments (ivermectin and diethylcarbamazine citrate), we tested 12 methanolic extracts of nine traditional plant remedies. The extracts (100-0.09 microg/ml) were incubated with 20 Loa loa microfilariae isolated from patients at 37 degrees C with 5% CO(2) in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal serum and antibiotics. Activity was evaluated 120 h later by counting live microfilariae under a microscope. Cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells was estimated by measuring 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2-5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide transformation to formazan at 450 nM in a spectrophotometer. The plants tested were Lophira alata, Greenwayodendron suaveolens, Uapaca togoensis, Zanthoxylum heitzii, Peperomia pellucida, Piptadeniastrum africanum, Petersianthus macrocarpus, Vernonia conferta, and Vernonia hymenolepis. Chemical screening showed that most of the extracts contained reducing sugars, tannin or polyphenols, sterols or triterpenes, saponosides, and alkaloids. None contained carotinoids and few contained flavonoids. The 50% lethal concentration ranged from 0.22 to 70.28 microg/ml, while the 50% inhibitory concentration for eukaryotic cells (IC(50)) ranged from 8.52 to 119.52 microg/ml. Extracts of P. macrocarpus (selectivity index = 72.16), P. africanum (13.69), Z. heitzii (12.11), and L. alata (9.26) were highly selective for L. loa.	l. alata polyphenols
4	Development and characterization of immobilized cannabinoid receptor (CB1/CB2) open tubular column for on-line screening.Cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, are therapeutic targets in the treatment of anxiety, obesity, movement disorders, glaucoma, and pain. We have developed an on-line screening method for CB1 and CB2 ligands, where cellular membrane fragments of a chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line, KU-812, were immobilized onto the surface of an open tubular (OT) capillary to create a CB1/CB2-OT column. The binding activities of the immobilized CB1/CB2 receptors were established using frontal affinity chromatographic techniques. This is the first report that confirms the presence of functional CB1 and CB2 receptors on KU-812 cells. The data from this study confirm that the CB1/CB2-OT column can be used to determine the binding affinities (K(i) values) for a single compound and to screen individual compounds or a mixture of multiple compounds. The CB1/CB2-OT column was also used to screen a botanical matrix, Zanthoxylum clava-herculis, where preliminary results suggest the presence of a high-affinity phytocannabinoid.

1	Methylxanthines reversibly inhibit tracheary-element differentiation in suspension cultures of Zinnia elegans L.Tracheary-element (TE) differentiation in suspension-cultured mesophyll cells of Zinnia elegans L. was completely inhibited by caffeine and theophylline only when these methylxanthines were applied at least 8 h prior to the appearance of secondary cell-wall thickenings. In contrast, the calcium-channel blocker nifedipine completely inhibited TE differentiation when applied only 2-3 h prior to the onset of secondary cell-wall deposition. This indicates the involvement of a methylxanthine-inhibitable event in TE differentiation that is distinguishable from an event dependent on influx of extracellular calcium. The correlation between the time of appearance of chlorotetracycline fluorescence (an indicator of sequestered Ca(2+)) and loss of methylxanthine effectiveness indicates that inhibition by methylxanthines may result from release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores. Methylxanthines with high potencies against adenosine 3' : 5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) phosphodiesterase and adenosine receptors were less effective inhibitors of TE differentiation, indicating that inhibition of differentiation by methylxanthines is independent of cAMP metabolism. The role of cAMP in transduction of the cytokinin signal, which was proposed previously on the basis of stimulation of TE differentiation by theophylline, was investigated using the non-hydrolyzable analog 8-bromo-cAMP. Although 8-bromo-cAMP stimulated differentiation in the absence of inductive concentrations of cytokinin, the non-cyclic analog 8-bromo-AMP was even more effective, indicating that 8-bromo-cAMP behaves as a cytokinin analog, rather than a second messenger, in stimulating TE differentiation. 	zinnia elegans methylxanthines
1	Studies on the effects of essential-oil-based feed additives on performance, ileal nutrient digestibility, and selected bacterial groups in the gastrointestinal tract of piglets.The aim of this study was to assess the effects of 2 different phytogenic products on performance, ileal nutrient digestibility, and composition of the intestinal microbiota. The 2 phytogenic products contained different essential oil mixtures (EOM) characterized by either menthol (Mentha arvensis; EOM-M) or cinnamon aldehyde (Cinnamomum aromaticum; EOM-C) as main constituents. Three treatments consisted of control diet without EOM addition and diets supplemented with EOM-M or EOM-C. Reproducibility of the effects was examined in 4 trials with a total of 300 male castrated and female piglets weaned at 25 d of age. The number of pens per treatment in trials I through III were 7, 9, and 9, respectively, for research station conditions, and 10 in trial IV for simulated farm conditions. In research station conditions, the experimental unit consisted of flat deck pens with 2 piglets per pen, whereas it consisted of floor pens with straw bedding with 5 piglets per pen in farm conditions. The feed additives had no effect on feed intake or BW gain. Improvements (P &lt; 0.05) in G:F were observed for EOM-M supplemented diets in 2 of 4 trials as well as for the combined data of all trials. These improvements were associated with greater (P&lt;0.05) apparent ileal digestibility of CP and of most AA. The effect of EOM-C on these response criteria was intermediate between control and EOM-M. Real-time PCR analysis of the gastrointestinal contents for 7 bacterial groups (Lactobacillus spp., Enterococcus spp., Clostridium coccoides and Clostridium leptum cluster, Escherichia spp., and Escherichia coli toxin estII) indicated no effect of treatments on the gastrointestinal microbiota. It was concluded that EOM-M consistently improved feed efficiency in weaned piglets, and it was associated with improved ileal protein and AA digestibility. In general, however, the effectiveness of EOM as feed additives differs considerably depending on the constituents.	mentha arvensis essential oil
2	Secondary metabolites and cytotoxic activities from the stem bark of Zanthoxylum nitidum.A dihydrobenzo[c]phenanthridine alkaloid, epizanthocadinanine A (1), together with 27 known compounds, including eight benzo[c]phenanthridines, i.e., oxynitidine (2), oxyavicine (3), oxychelerythrine (4), dihydrochelerythrine (5), 6-acetonyldihydrochelerythrine (6), norchelerythrine (7), decarine (8), and arnottianamide (9); two 2-quinolones, i.e., flindersine (10) and 4-methoxy-1-methyl-2-quinolone (11); two furoquinolines, i.e., skimmianine (12) and gamma-fagarine (13); three aporphines, i.e., liriodenine (14), N-acetyldehydroanonaine (15), and N-acetylanonaine (16); six lignans, i.e., sesamin (17), episesamin (18), piperitol-3,3-dimethylallyl ether (19), xanthoxylol-3,3-dimethylallyl ether (20), savinin (21), and 2,3-bis(3,4-methylenedioxybenzyl)but-2-en-4-olide (22); three terpenoids, i.e., alpha-cadinol (23), anticopalol (24), and spathulenol (25); one coumarin, i.e., aesculetin dimethyl ether (26); and two steroids, i.e., beta-sitosterol (27) and beta-sitostenone (28) were isolated from the stem bark of Zanthoxylum nitidum. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of extensive 1D- and 2D-NMR as well as MS analyses. Moreover, the recently reported structures 2'-4' of rhoifolines B and A, and '8-methoxynorchelerythrine', resp., isolated as new compounds from Z. rhoifolium and Z. nitidum, resp., could be assigned the revised structures 2-4 by reinvestigation of the spectroscopic data. In addition, the cytotoxicity of the isolates was evaluated on the MCF-7, NCI-H460, and SF-268 cell lines. Among these isolates, liriodenine (14) was the most active compound against the MCF-7, NCI-H460, and SF-268 cell lines with IC(50) values of 2.19, 2.38, and 3.19 microg/ml, resp.	z. nitidum cytotoxicity
1	Application of near-infrared spectroscopy in quality control and determination of adulteration of African essential oils.An evaluation has been made of the potential of near-infrared (NIR) technologies in the assessment of essential oil components and in the identification of individual essential oils. The results showed that cross-validation models are able to predict accurately almost all of the components of essential oils. In different cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum) and clove (Syzygium aromaticum) essential oils, which showed a similar composition, 23 components (representing 97.8-99.9% of the oil) were accurately predicted, as well as 20 components (93.0-99.1%) in Cinnamomum camphora (ravintsara), 32 components (92.3-98.1%) in Ravensara aromatica (ravensara), and 26 components (96.6-98.4%) in Lippia multiflora. For almost all of the components, the modelled and reference values obtained by GC-FID were highly correlated (r2 &gt; or = 0.985) and exhibited a low variance (less than 5%). The model was also able to discriminate between the ravintsara and ravensara essential oils. It was shown that two commercial oils labelled as R. aromatica were actually ravintsara (C. camphora), revealing the misidentification of these essential oils in the marketplace. The study demonstrates the application of NIR technology as a quality control tool for the rapid identification of individual essential oils, for product authentication, and for the detection of adulteration.	ravintsara essential oils
1	The effect of cinnamaldehyde on the growth and the morphology of Candida albicans.We examined the viability and morphology of Candida albicans under experimental conditions after treatment with varying concentrations of cinnamaldehyde, the major component of cassia (Cinnamomum cassia), using XTT assay, fluorescent microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and thin-section electron microscopy. At 10 mug/ml level, cinnamaldehyde inhibited mycelial growth, but did not affect the growth of yeast cells, metabolic activity, cell shape, or the ultrastructure of the cells. At 40 mug/ml level, cinnamaldehyde showed fungicidal activity accompanied by alteration of the membrane and interior of Candida cells. These findings indicate that cinnamaldehyde has both fungistatic and fungicidal activities against C. albicans and affects the structure of the cells.	Candida cinnamaldehyde
1	Enhancement of anti-cholinesterase activity of Zingiber cassumunar essential oil using a microemulsion technique.The aim of the present study was to enhance the cholinesterase inhibitory activity of Zingiber cassumunar (ZC) oil using a microemulsion (ME) technique. Pseudoternary phase diagrams of the oil, water, and surfactant/co-surfactant mixture were constructed using a water titration method. Effects of co-surfactant, surfactant/co-surfactant ratio, ionic strength, and pH were examined by means of the microemulsion region which existed in the phase diagrams. The inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) were tested by Ellman's colorimetric assay. It was found that ZC oil possesses inhibitory activity against not only AChE but also BChE. Formulation of ZC oil as ME revealed that alkyl chain length and number of hydroxyl groups of co-surfactant exhibited a remarkable effect on the pseudoternary phase diagram. Longer alkyl chains and more hydroxyl groups gave smaller regions of MEs. Ionic strength also affected the ME region. However, the phase behavior was hardly influenced by pH. The suitable ZC oil ME was composed of Triton X-114 in combination with propylene glycol. The anti-cholinesterase activity of this ME was much higher than that of native ZC oil. It exhibited twenty times and twenty five times higher inhibitory activity against AChE and BChE, respectively. ZC oil loaded ME is an attractive formulation for further characterization and an in vivo study in an animal model with Alzheimer's disease.	ZC cassumunar essential oil
1	Polyphenolic constituent structures of Zanthoxylum piperitum fruit and the antibacterial effects of its polymeric procyanidin on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.Zanthoxylum piperitum (Rutaceae) is used as a spice and a natural medicine in Japan. Our study found that ZP-CT-A, a polymeric proanthocyanidin purified from the fruit of this species, noticeably decreased the minimum inhibitory concentrations of beta-lactam antibiotics for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The structure of ZP-CT-A was characterized on the basis of (13)C NMR and size exclusion chromatographic data and the results of thiolytic degradation. A mechanistic study of the effects of ZP-CT-A indicated that it suppressed the activity of beta-lactamase and largely decreased the stability of the bacterial cell membrane of MRSA, as shown by a reduction in the tolerance of MRSA to low osmotic pressure and high ionic strength solutions.	staphylococcus aureus procyanidin
2	Anthelmintic screening of Zimbabwean plants traditionally used against schistosomiasis.Extracts of 23 plant species used popularly against schistosomiasis in Zimbabwe were screened for their anthelmintic effect. Schistosomules of the trematode Schistosoma mansoni and cysticercoids of the cestode Hymenolepis diminuta were studied in vitro. The material consisted of 58 plant extracts, of which 37 killed the newly excysted cysticercoids within an hour, when incubated in a culture medium. Lethal concentrations varied from 0.8 to 103 mg/ml. All plant extracts showed activity against the tapeworms after 24 h. Ten of the best extracts were also tested against schistosomules. Five of these extracts showed activity. Lethal concentrations varied from 0.6 to 33.8 mg/ml of dry plant material. Extracts of stem and root from Abrus precatorius (Fabaceae), of root bark and leaves from Ozoroa insignis (Anacardiaceae) and of root bark from Zizyphus mucronata (Rhamnaceae) gave the best results against tapeworms. The best results against schistosomules were obtained with stem and root extracts from Abrus precatorius (Fabaceae) and stem bark from Elephantorrhiza goetzei (Mimosaceae). Although the activity of root and root bark extracts commonly used in traditional medicine was verified in this study, our results showed that also extracts from leaf and stem can be effective anthelmintics.	elephantorrhiza goetzei trematode schistosoma mansoni
1	Augmentation of expression of immunocytes' functions by seed extract of Ziziphus mauritiana (Lamk.).AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study was carried out to evaluate the immunomodulatory potential of Ziziphus mauritiana (Lamk.) seed extract to ascertain the folkloric claim as immunomodulator. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The aqueous-ethanolic seed extract (100-400 mg kg(-1)) of Z. mauritiana was investigated for immunomodulatory potential in mice. The extract was standardized with HPLC using betulinic acid as a marker. Functions of various immunocytes in the form of humoral (development of anti-SRBC (sheep red blood cells) antibody titers) and cell-mediated immune response (delayed type hypersensitivity, nitroblue tetrazolium reduction, inducible nitric oxide synthase activity and bactericidal activity) was studied in SRBC immunized mice. The cytokine, IFN-gamma (interferon-gamma) and IL-4 (interleukin-4) secretion was also measured quantitatively by ELISA as the expression of functions of Th-1 and Th-2 respectively. Levamisole (2.5 mg kg(-1)) was used as standard drug. RESULTS: The seed extract demonstrated significant (P&lt;0.05-0.001) up-regulation of cell-mediated, humoral immune response and Th-1 mediated cytokine IFN-gamma and decline in Th-2 mediated cytokine IL-4. At higher dose of extract the results were comparable to that of the levamisole. CONCLUSION: The immunostimulatory potential of this seed extract is likely to be mediated through its effect on macrophage function and Th-1 mediated immunity confirming the folkloric use of this plant.	z. mauritiana betulinic acid
1	Protective Effect of Selected Medicinal Plants against Hydrogen Peroxide Induced Oxidative Damage on Biological Substrates.Oxidative stress is developed due to susceptibility of biological substrates to oxidation by generation of free radicals. In degenerative diseases, oxidative stress level can be reduced by antioxidants which neutralize free radicals. Primary objective of this work was to screen four medicinal plants, namely, Andrographis paniculata, Costus speciosus, Canthium parviflorum, and Abrus precatorius, for their antioxidant property using two biological substrates-RBC and microsomes. The antioxidative ability of three solvent extracts, methanol (100% and 80%) and aqueous leaf extracts, was studied at different concentrations by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances method using Fenton's reagent to induce oxidation in the substrates. The polyphenol and flavonoid content were analyzed to relate with the observed antioxidant effect of the extracts. The phytochemical screening indicated the presence of flavonoids, polyphenols, tannins, and beta-carotene in the samples. In microsomes, 80% methanol extract of Canthium and Costus and, in RBC, 80% methanol extract of Costus showed highest inhibition of oxidation and correlated well with the polyphenol and flavonoid content. From the results it can be concluded that antioxidants from medicinal plants are capable of inhibiting oxidation in biological systems, suggesting scope for their use as nutraceuticals. 	abrus precatorius flavonoid
3	2'-Hydroxycinnamaldehyde targets low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 to inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced microglial activation.2'-Hydroxycinnamaldehyde (HCA) isolated from the stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia and its derivative 2'-benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde (BCA) were reported to have anti-angiogenic, anti-proliferative, and anti-inflammatory effects in several human cancer cells and RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. However, effects of HCA/BCA on the neuroinflammation have not been investigated. In the present study, a potential anti-neuroinflammatory effect of HCA/BCA was assessed in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated microglial cultures and microglia/neuroblastoma cocultures. Nitric oxide production, inflammatory gene expression, and signaling pathways were investigated. HCA/BCA significantly decreased the production of nitric oxide and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in microglial cells. HCA/BCA also attenuated the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and TNF-alpha at mRNA level via blockade of ERK, JNK, p38 MAPK, and NF-kappaB activation. Moreover, HCA/BCA was neuroprotective by reducing microglia-mediated neuroblastoma cell death in a microglia-neuroblastoma co-culture. Affinity chromatography and LC-MS/MS analysis identified low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) as a potential molecular target of HCA in microglial cells. Based on the studies using the receptor-associated protein (RAP) that blocks a ligand binding to LRP1 and the siRNA-mediated LRP1 gene silencing, we were able to conclude that HCA inhibited LPS-induced microglial activation via LRP1. Our results suggest that HCA/BCA be anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective in the CNS by targeting LRP1, and may have a therapeutic potential against neuroinflammatory diseases.

1	Three new compounds from Cinnamomum cassia.Three new compounds, including two new diterpenoids, named epianhydrocinnzeylanol (1) and cinnacasiol H (2), and one hydroxylasiodiplodin, (3R,4S,6R)-4,6-dihydroxy-de-O-methyllasiodiplodin (3), together with five known diterpenoids (4-8) and two known phenolic glycosides (9-10) were isolated from the barks of Cinnamomum cassia. Their structures were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analysis and comparison of the chemical shift values with those of related known compounds. The anti-inflammatory activities of the isolates were evaluated on nitric oxide production in lipopolysaccharide-induced BV-2 microglial cells and the compounds showed weak inhibition activities. 	cinnamomum cassia cinnacasiol h
2	Analgesia Synergism of Essential Oil from Pericarp of Zanthoxylum schinifolium and Verapamil.Objective. To evaluate the synergistic analgesic effect of essential oil of Zanthoxylum schinifolium Sieb. et Zucc. (EOZ) and verapamil (Ver). Method. The qualitative and quantitative composition of EOZ were determined with gas chromatography/Mass spectrometer. The interaction between EOZ and Ver in antinociceptive activity was evaluated by using acetic acid-induced writhing, hot plate, and tail flick tests in mice and in isolated toad sciatic nerve test. Results. Linalool, limonene, and sabinene are the major components of EOZ. EOZ (middle-dose: 40 mg kg(-1), high-dose: 80 mg kg(-1)) and EOZ + Ver (Each dose group) have remarkable analgesic effects on pain in mice induced by acetic acid-induced writhing, hot plate, and tail flick tests. Low-dose EOZ (20 mg kg(-1)) had no analgesic action, but when it is combined with Ver it has shown significant antinociception. Verapamil has a faint analgesic effect but was not able to inhibit action potential transmission in toad sciatic nerve. EOZ (0.2%) and EOZ + Ver (0.2% + 0.05%) also inhibited action potential transmission in toad sciatic nerve. Combination of EOZ with Ver had a greater analgesic effect and inhibition of nerve action potential transmission compared to its components EOZ and Ver. Conclusion. The combination of EOZ with Ver produces a synergistic analgesic effect. 	zanthoxylum schinifolium Analgesia
1	Purification and characterization of flavonoids from the leaves of Zanthoxylum bungeanum and correlation between their structure and antioxidant activity.Nine flavonoids were isolated and characterized from the leaves of Zanthoxylum bungeanum. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic techniques as quercetin (1), afzelin (2), quercitrin (3), trifolin (4), quercetin-3-O-beta-D-glucoside (5), isorhamnetin 3-O-alpha-L-rhamnoside (6), hyperoside (7), vitexin (8) and rutin (9). All compounds were isolated from the leaves of Z. bungeanum for the first time. Five compounds (2, 4, 5, 6 and 8) were found for the first time in the genus Zanthoxylum. To learn the mechanisms underlying its health benefits, in vitro (DPPH, ABTS, FRAP and lipid peroxidation inhibition assays) and in vivo (protective effect on Escherichia coli under peroxide stress) antioxidant activities of the nine flavonoids were measured. Quercetin and quercetin glycosides (compounds 1, 3, 5, 7, 9) showed the highest antioxidant activity. Structure-activity relationships indicated that the -OH in 4' position on the B ring and the -OH in 7 position on the A ring possessed high antioxidant activity; B ring and/or A ring with adjacent -OH groups could greatly increase their antioxidant ability. Also, due to the different structures of various flavonoids, they will certainly exhibit different antioxidant capacity when the reactions occur in solution or in oil-in-water emulsion. These findings suggest that Z. bungeanum leaves may have health benefits when consumed. It could become a useful supplement for pharmaceutical products and functional food ingredients in both nutraceutical and food industries as a potential source of natural antioxidants. 	z. bungeanum quercitrin
2	Preventive effect of Abelmoschus manihot (L.) Medik. on bone loss in the ovariectomised rats.Because the biggest culprit in pathogenesis of osteoporosis is oestrogen deficiency, hormone replacement therapy remained the mainstay for prevention. However most of postmenopausal women are more inclined to use natural alternative. We thus investigated the ability of Abelmoschus manihot, a herbal medicine to prevent bone loss in ovariectomised rats. Female Wistar rats were sham operated (SH: 8) or ovariectomised (OVX: 24). On day 0, OVX rats were randomly assigned to groups as follows: eight received 10% Abelmoschus manihot leaves in their diet, eight were given 15% Abelmoschus manihot leaves and eight were untreated (OVX). Compounds were mixed with a soy protein-free diet and given orally for 3 months. At necropsy, bone mineral density (BMD) in the femur and in its metaphyseal zone was lower in OVX than SH (p&lt;0.05). This osteopenia was prevented by consumption of the highest dose of Abelmoschus manihot leaves. Bone mineral content (BMC) in the total femur and its metaphyseal and diaphyseal subregions was improved, as well (p&lt;0.05). This could be explained by a trend towards decreased bone resorption. The lowest dose did not elicit any significant effect. In conclusion, Abelmoschus manihot consumption, at the dose of 15% in the diet, provided bone-sparing effects by improving both BMD and BMC.	abelmoschus manihot BMD
4	Cinnamaldehyde induces cell apoptosis mediated by a novel circular RNA hsa_circ_0043256 in non-small cell lung cancer.Cinnamaldehyde (CA), the primary chemical component of the Chinese traditional herb Cinnamomum cassia, is an effective cytotoxic agent against various human cancers. Our previous study indicated that CA could trigger apoptosis in three kinds of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. However, CA mechanism of action in NSCLC has not been unveiled completely. Herein, we showed that a novel circular RNA hsa_circ_0043256 was upregulated in NSCLC cells in response to CA treatment, as detected by microarray and real-time PCR. Hsa_circ_0043256 could inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis, while hsa_circ_0043256 knock-down could promote cell proliferation and restrain apoptosis induced by CA. Bioinformatics analysis predicted that hsa_circ_0043256 could work as a miR-1252 sponge, which could in turn directly target a vital negative regulator of Canonical Wnt signaling, Itchy E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (ITCH), as validated by dual-luciferase assay. Western blot results further confirmed that hsa_circ_0043256 could upregulate ITCH expression, whereas miR-1252 could partially abolish this effect. Interestingly, hsa_circ_0043256 knock-down could weaken Wnt/beta-catenin pathway inhibition induced by CA. Finally, we discovered that CA induced apoptosis and meanwhile upregulated hsa_circ_0043256 expression in vivo. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that ITCH expression was positively association with hsa_circ_0043256 levels. Above all, we characterized a new mechanism mediated by hsa_circ_0043256/miR-1252/ITCH axis in CA function against NSCLC, providing a novel insight into lung cancer therapy.	ITCH NSCLC
1	2-undecanone rich leaf essential oil from Zanthoxylum armatum.The leaf essential oils of Zanthoxylum armatum DC (Rutaceae) from Kumaon, India, extracted by hydrodistillation, were analyzed by capillary gas chromatography (GC-FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The major classes of compounds found in the leaf oils were acyclic and menthane monoterpenoids as well as simple alcohols, aldehydes and ketones. The high proportion of non-terpenic acyclic ketones, notably 2-undecanone and 2-tridecanone, and the low abundance of undec-10-en-1-al and p-phellandren-8-ol make the composition entirely new. Other constituents present in significant amounts were oxygenated monoterpenes, which include 1,8-cineole, linalool, terpinen-4-ol, and alpha-terpineol, and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons represented mainly by trans-caryophyllene, a-humulene and germacrene D. On the contrary, the oil distilled from the leaves on the second day of distillation was characterized by a high content of 2-tridecanone (27.1%) and trans-caryophyllene (7.4%), as compared with 3.5% and 4.6%, respectively, for the fresh leaves; a slight decrease in pH of the distillate was also significant. Moreover, the presence of a high 2-undecanone content followed by 2-tridecanone is being reported for the first time for Z. armatum from this region. In terms of molecular diversity, the simple acyclic ketones dominate the essential oils as compared with linalool that was reported in several previous studies on Z. armatum. Therefore, the two acyclic ketones may be utilized to establish the origin and authenticity of the material.	z. armatum linalool
1	Anti-inflammatory activity of compounds isolated from the aerial parts of Abrus precatorius (Fabaceae).Two triterpenoid saponins 1 and 2 isolated from the aerial parts of Abrus precatorius and their acetates derivatives, 3 and 4 have been tested for anti-inflammatory activity using the croton oil ear model. All the compounds exhibited anti-inflammatory activity but the acetates showed greater inhibition than the parent compounds.	abrus precatorius triterpenoid
1	Antifungal constituents of northern prickly ash, Zanthoxylum americanum mill.Leaf, fruit, stem, bark and root of Zanthoxylum americanum were investigated for antifungal activity with 11 strains of fungi representing diverse opportunistic and systemic pathogens, including Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus fumigatus. All extracts demonstrated a broad spectrum of antifungal activity and inhibited at least eight fungal species in a disk diffusion assay (600 microg/disk). Antifungal activity was light-dependent, with fruit and leaf extracts most active in general. The presence of light-mediated compounds, such as psoralen, 8-methoxypsoralen and imperatorin in extracts of different organs was confirmed by RP-HPLC. A high furanocoumarin content was detected in fruit and leaf and low furanocoumarin levels were found in bark and wood. A high positive correlation was observed between total furanocoumarin content and fungal inhibition zones (r2=0.902, p&lt;0.001). The results provide a phytochemical basis for the very widespread use of Z. americanum in indigenous North American ethnomedical tradition for conditions that may be related to fungal infections.	z. americanum psoralen
1	Three new pterocarpans from the aerial parts of Abrus Precatorius.Three new pterocarpans, named abrusprecatins A-C (1-3), along with three known ones, namely medicarpin (4), maackiain (5), and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-8,9-methylenedioxypterocarpan (6) were isolated from the aerial parts of Abrus precatorius. The structures of these compounds were established by extensive analysis of mass spectrometric data, 1 D and 2 D NMR spectroscopic data. In addition, the absolute configurations were determined by a combination of single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis and circular dichroism spectroscopy.	abrus precatorius pterocarpans
1	Isolation of substances with antiproliferative and apoptosis-inducing activities against leukemia cells from the leaves of Zanthoxylum ailanthoides Sieb. &amp; Zucc.Extraction of the leaves of Zanthoxylum ailanthoides Sieb. &amp; Zucc. affords extracts and four isolated compounds which exhibit activities against leukemia cells. The chloroform-soluble fraction (ZAC) of the crude extract of this plant showed cytotoxic activity against human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) and myelomonocytic leukemia (WEHI-3) cells with IC(50) values of 73.06 and 42.22 mug/mL, respectively. The active ZAC was further separated to yield pheophorbide-a methyl ester (1), pheophorbide-b methyl ester (2), 13(2)-hydroxyl (13(2)-S) pheophorbide-a methyl ester (3) and 13(2)-hydroxyl (13(2)-R) pheophorbide-b methyl ester (4) whose structures were confirmed by spectroscopic methods. Compounds 2-4 showed cytotoxic activities against both leukemia cells with IC(50) value in the range of 46.76-79.43 nM, whereas compound 1 exhibited only weak cytotoxic activity. The extracts and compounds 1-4 also induced apoptosis and DNA damage in leukemia cells after treatment. The results suggested that the Z. ailanthoides is biologically active against leukemia cells.	z. ailanthoides pheophorbide-b methyl ester
1	Optimization of the separation and determination of nitidine and chelerythrine in Zanthoxylum nitidum by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection.A new ion-pair high-performance liquid chromatography method with fluorescence detection was developed for the determination of nitidine and chelerythrine in Zanthoxylum nitidum. To optimize the separation of the two compounds in reversed-phase liquid chromatography, a response surface method (Box-Behnken designs) was used. Three important factors: concentration of ion pair agent, mobile phase composition and buffer pH, were studied for their contribution to the analytes' response, leading to a total of 17 experiments performed on a Kromasil C18 column. The experimental responses were fitted into a second-order polynomial to predict the best conditions. The optimal mobile phase conditions were predicted to be acetonitrile-sodium dodecyl sulphate (17.8 mM, 20 mM citric acid, pH 2.98, 57:43, v/v). The proposed method was validated according to International Conference on Harmonization guidelines and it is suggested to be appropriate for the routine quality control analysis of nitidine and chelerythrine in Zanthoxylum nitidum. 	zanthoxylum nitidum chelerythrine
1	Growth-Inhibiting Effects of Cinnamomum cassia Bark-Derived Materials on Human Intestinal Bacteria.The growth-inhibiting activity of Cinnamomum cassia (Blume) bark-derived materials toward five intestinal bacteria was examined using an impregnated paper disk method and compared with that of tetracycline and chloramphenicol, as well as four commercially available compounds (cinnamyl alcohol, trans-cinnamic acid, eugenol, and salicylaldehyde). The biologically active component of C. cassia bark was characterized as cinnamaldehyde by spectral analysis. The growth responses varied with each bacterial strain tested. In a test using 1 and 0.5 mg/disks, cinnamaldehyde revealed potent inhibition against Clostridium perfringensand Bacteroides fragilis. At 1 and 0.5 mg/disk, growth of Bifidobacterium bifidum was significantly inhibited, whereas weak or no inhibitory activity was obtained against Bifidobacterium longum or Lactobacillus acidophilus. The inhibitory effect was much more pronounced in Cl. perfringens, B. fragilis, and Bi. bifidum, compared to Bi. longum or L. acidophilus. Salicylaldehyde exhibited moderate growth-inhibiting activity, but little or no inhibition was observed from treatments with cinnamyl alcohol, trans-cinnamic acid, and eugenol. In contrast, tetracycline and chloramphenicol significantly inhibited growth of all test bacteria as low as 0.01 mg/disk. These results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of C. cassia bark.	c. cassia cinnamaldehyde
4	Abrus precatorius agglutinin-derived peptides induce ROS-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis through JNK and Akt/P38/P53 pathways in HeLa cells.10kDAGP, a tryptic digest of Abrus precatorius lectin 'Agglutinin' is known to induce apoptosis by mitochondria-dependent pathways in human cervical cancer (HeLa) cells. The present study was focused on deciphering the detailed molecular mechanism of apoptosis induction in vitro by 10kDAGP and also its in vivo therapeutic efficacy. For in vivo model, HeLa cell encapsulated hollow fiber was implanted in Swiss Albino mice and treated with 10kDAGP. Our results showed that 10kDAGP was able to enter the cell within a span of 20min and co-localized with mitochondria after 90min. of incubation. A drastic loss of mitochondrial membrane potential was noted within 6h of 10kDAGP administration along with an increase in ROS generation. ROS further led to symptoms of early apoptosis by deregulating Akt (Protein Kinase B) and activating c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK), p38 Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK), p53, and autophagy starting from ~8h of incubation. Besides in vitro conditions, 10kDAGP activated JNK to mediate cancer cell killing in vivo. Therefore, 10kDAGP can be an excellent therapeutic agent as it can act through different ways in the cellular system. Future studies are directed to screen out active peptides from the pool of peptides and to study whether the mode of action is in synergistic way or in individual forms. 	Akt cancer
1	Microdesigned Nanocellulose-Based Flexible Antibacterial Aerogel Architectures Impregnated with Bioactive Cinnamomum cassia.This work is strategically premeditated to study the potential of a herbal medicinal product as a natural bioactive ingredient to generate nanocellulose-based antibacterial architectures. In situ fibrillation of purified cellulose was done in cinnamon extract (ciE) to obtain microfibrillated cellulose (MFC). To this MFC suspension, carboxylated cellulose nanocrystals (cCNCs) were homogeneously mixed and the viscous gel thus obtained was freeze-dried to obtain lightweight and flexible composite aerogel architectures impregnated with ciE, namely, ciMFC/cCNCs. At an optimal concentration of 0.3 wt % cCNCs (i.e., for ciMFC/cCNCs_0.3), an improvement of around 106% in compressive strength and 175% increment in modulus were achieved as compared to pristine MFC architecture. The efficient loading and interaction of ciE components, specifically cinnamaldehyde, with MFC and cCNCs resulted in developing competent antibacterial surfaces with dense and uniform microstructures. Excellent and long-term antimicrobial activity of the optimized architectures (ciMFC/cCNCs_0.3) was confirmed through various antibacterial assays like the zone inhibition method, bacterial growth observation at OD600, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC, here 1 mg/mL), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC, here 3-5 mg/mL), and Live/Dead BacLight viability tests. The changes in the bacterial morphology with a disrupted membrane were further confirmed through various imaging techniques like confocal laser scanning microscopy, FESEM, AFM, and 3D digital microscopy. The dry composite architecture showed the persuasive capability of suppressing the growth of airborne bacteria, which in combination with antibacterial efficiency in the wet state is considered as an imperative aspect for a material to act as the novel biomaterial. Furthermore, these architectures demonstrated excellent antibacterial performance under real "in use" contamination prone conditions. Hence, this work provides avenues for the application of crude natural extracts in developing novel forms of advanced functional biomaterials that can be used for assorted biological/healthcare applications such as wound care and antimicrobial filtering units.	cinnamomum cassia cinnamaldehyde
1	Structural characterization of polysaccharides from Zizyphus jujuba and evaluation of antioxidant activity.Fruit of Zizyphus jujuba Mill, a traditional Chinese herb widely consumed in Asian countries, has been reported to possess several vital biological activities. This study intends to develop an appropriate analytical method for isolation of polysaccharides from Z. jujuba fruits and evaluate their antioxidant activity. Initially, powdered Z. jujuba fruits were subjected to hot water extraction, followed by ethanol precipitation, deproteination, dialysis and fractionation in a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column. One neutral polysaccharide fraction (ZJPN) and 3 acidic polysaccharide fractions (ZJPa1, ZJPa2 and ZJPa3) were isolated with the average MW ranging from 40,566 to 129,518 Da. GC analysis revealed that 6 monosaccharides, namely, rhamnose, arabinose, xylose, mannose, glucose and galactose were present in polysaccharide fractions. The galacturonic acid content in polysaccharide fractions followed the order: ZJPa3&gt;ZJPa2&gt;ZJPa1&gt;ZJPN. All the 4 polysaccharide fractions were found to be more effective in scavenging superoxide anions than hydroxyl radicals, while acidic polysaccharides showed a more pronounced effect in chelating ferrous ion.	z. jujuba monosaccharides
1	Three new compounds from Cinnamomum cassia.Three new compounds, including two new diterpenoids, named epianhydrocinnzeylanol (1) and cinnacasiol H (2), and one hydroxylasiodiplodin, (3R,4S,6R)-4,6-dihydroxy-de-O-methyllasiodiplodin (3), together with five known diterpenoids (4-8) and two known phenolic glycosides (9-10) were isolated from the barks of Cinnamomum cassia. Their structures were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analysis and comparison of the chemical shift values with those of related known compounds. The anti-inflammatory activities of the isolates were evaluated on nitric oxide production in lipopolysaccharide-induced BV-2 microglial cells and the compounds showed weak inhibition activities. 	cinnamomum cassia (3R,4S,6R)-4,6-dihydroxy-de-O-methyllasiodiplodin
2	Evaluation of the antidiabetic property of aqueous leaves extract of Zanthoxylum armatum DC. using in vivo and in vitro approaches.The present study was designed to evaluate the antidiabetic potential of the aqueous leaves extract of Zanthoxylum armatum DC. leaves using in vivo and in vitro approaches. For in vivo studies, blood glucose level was monitored at different intervals after administration of varying doses of the extract for its hypoglycemic (100-6000 mg/kg b.w.) and antihyperglycemic (250 mg/kg b.w.) effect in normoglycemic and diabetic mice. In vitro enzymatic inhibition activity was tested against alpha-amylase, alpha- and beta-glucosidase and lipase. Additionally hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide scavenging assay and phytochemical screening were also performed. Element analysis of the plant was studied by Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometer (ICP-AES). The plant extract showed significant hypoglycemic and antihyperglycemic effect in normoglycemic and diabetic mice. The IC50 values of extract for alpha-amylase, beta-glucosidase, lipase, hydroxyl radical scavenging activity, hydrogen peroxide scavenging activity were 7.40 mg/ml, 0.30 mg/ml, 8.35 mg/ml, 3.25 mg/ml, 9.62 mg/ml respectively and the percentage of inhibition for alpha-glucosidase was 79.82% at 0.8 mg/ml. In vitro studies were compared with their respective standards. Elemental analysis revealed the presence of essential elements such as Mg, V, Fe, Cr, Zn, Cu, Mo, Mn, K, Ca, P and Sr which are all known to play a role in regulating blood glucose. The results demonstrate that Z. armatum aqueous leaves extract possess antidiabetic property in both in vivo and in vitro condition.	z. armatum diabetic
1	Volatile organic nitrogen-containing constituents in ambrette seed Abelmoschus moschatus Medik (Malvaceae).A detailed investigation of the basic fraction of a CO2 extract of ambrette seeds (Abelmoschus moschatus) revealed a total of 58 nitrogen-containing compounds. The identification of these compounds was carried out by GC-MS and NMR. All the identified nitrogen-containing compounds are reported here for the first time in ambrette seeds. Among these are 27 pyrazine derivatives and 12 pyridines, including the tentative identification of four new natural compounds, 1-(6-ethyl-3-hydroxypyridin-2-yl)ethanone (1), 1-(3-hydroxy-5,6-dimethylpyridin-2-yl)ethanone (2), 1-(3-hydroxy-6-methylpyridin-2-yl)ethanone (3), and 1-(3-hydroxy-5-methylpyridin-2-yl)ethanone (4). The odor of the basic fraction was assumed to be due to these pyrazines and pyridines and also the presence of seven thiazoles. The odors described suggest that these N-compounds contribute to what is described in perfumery terms as the "natural and rounded" character of the ambrette extract.	abelmoschus moschatus pyridines
2	Zanthoxylum schinifolium leaf ethanol extract inhibits adipocyte differentiation through inactivation of the extracellular signal regulated kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathways in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes.Zanthoxylum schinifolium is widely used as a food flavoring in east Asia. Although this plant has also been used in traditional oriental medicine for the treatment of the common cold, toothache, stomach ache, diarrhea and jaundice, its anti-obesity activity remains to be elucidated. The present study investigated the effects of ethanol extract from the leaves of Z. schinifolium (EEZS) on adipocyte differentiation, and its underlying mechanism, in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes. The results demonstrated that EEZS effectively suppressed intracellular lipid accumulation at non-toxic concentrations, and was associated with the downregulation of several adipocyte-specific transcription factors, including peroxisome proliferation-activity receptor gamma (PPARgamma), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP)alpha and C/EBPbeta, in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, it was observed that EEZS markedly inactivated the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways, which act upstream of PPARgamma and C/EBPs in adipogenesis. These results suggested that EEZS inhibited lipid accumulation by downregulating the major transcription factors involved in the pathway of adipogenesis, including PPARgamma, C/EBPalpha and C/EBPbeta, via regulation of the ERK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways in 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. This indicated the potential use of EEZS as an anti-obesity agent.	z. schinifolium jaundice
3	Miscellaneous terpenoid constituents of Abies nephrolepis and their moderate cytotoxic activities.Three monoterpenoids and two triterpenoids were isolated from Abies nephrolepis together with 53 known terpenoids. The structures of the compounds were established by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. The absolute configuration of 3-hydroxycamphane-2-carboxylic acid was established as (1S,2R,3S,4R) by Cu-Kalpha X-ray crystallography. All 58 isolates were tested for cytotoxic activity against four tumor cells viz. A549 (human lung adenocarcinoma), Colo205 (colon adenocarcinoma), QGY-7703 (human hepatoma) and THP-1 (human monocytic leukemia). alpha-Cadinol exhibited the best effects on A549, Colo205 and QGY-7703 with IC(50) values of 8.6, 8.1 and 4.6 mug/mL, respectively.	alpha-Cadinol colon adenocarcinoma
1	Investigation of in vivo metabolic profile of Abelmoschus Manihot based on pattern recognition analysis.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Abelmoschus manihot (L.) Medik. var. manihot is one of the most commonly used Chinese medicines and has played an important role in treating chronic glomerulonephritis and diabetic nephropathy. AIM OF THE STUDY: Metabolites identification of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a complex and time-consuming process due to the complicity of TCM and subsequent large number of detected ions. In this paper, UPLC-MS combined with pattern recognition analysis approach were used to simplify and quicken the identification of the metabolites of Abelmoschus Manihot. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rat urine samples were collected before (as control sample) and after Abelmoschus Manihot administration. Pattern recognition analysis method was used to differentiate components between Abelmoschus Manihot-treated group and its controlled comparison. These components could be considered as Abelmoschus Manihot-related metabolites in vivo. RESULTS: LC-MS based metabolomics could be an advanced tool to help us find metabolites with regards to its capacity of processing large datasets, differentiating and classifying of sample groups, as well as its indiscriminative nature of biomarker and metabolite identification. Using this method, seven metabolites were identified, which are flavonoid aglycone glucuronidation, sulfatation, and methylation metabolites. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that UPLC-MS based- pattern recognition analysis approach can be used to quickly identify Abelmoschus Manihot related metabolites in biological fluids. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the potential application of combining the UPLC-MS approach with the metabolomics approach in identifying the metabolites of TCM.	abelmoschus manihot aglycone
1	Ultrasound-Assisted Extraction of Taxifolin, Diosmin, and Quercetin from Abies nephrolepis (Trautv.) Maxim: Kinetic and Thermodynamic Characteristics.Extraction behaviors of the 3 flavonoids taxifolin, diosmin, and quercetin have been investigated in Abies nephrolepis leaves and bark. The following operation parameters-ethanol volume fraction, liquid-solid ratio, temperature, ultrasound irradiation power and time, and ultrasound frequency-were varied to study their effect on the yield of the 3 flavonoids during extraction. The results showed that a low extraction efficiency occurred at 293.15 K due to slow kinetics, while the situation was significantly improved at 333.15 K. The kinetic data for the extraction yields of the 3 flavonoids achieved good fits by the first-order kinetic model. From the thermodynamic analysis results, we realized that the ultrasound-assisted extraction of taxifolin, diosmin, and quercetin from the leaves and bark of A. nephrolepis was a spontaneous and endothermic process in which the disorder increased (DeltaG0 < 0, DeltaH0 > 0, and DeltaS0 > 0). According to the response surface methodology (RSM) analysis, under the optimal operation conditions (ethanol concentration of 50%, liquid-solid ratio of 20 mL/g, frequency of 45 kHz, extraction time of 39.25 min, ultrasound irradiation power of 160 W and temperature of 332.19 K), the total yield of the 3 flavonoids were 100.93 +- 4.01 mg/g from the leaves of A. nephrolepis (with 31.03 +- 1.51 mg/g, 0.31 +- 0.01 mg/g, 69.59 +- 2.57 mg/g for taxifolin, diosmin, and quercetin, respectively), and under the optimal operation conditions (ethanol concentration of 50%, liquid-solid ratio of 20 mL/g, frequency of 45 kHz, extraction time of 36.80 min, ultrasound irradiation power of 150 W and temperature of 328.78 K), 16.05 mg/g +- 0.38 mg/g were obtained from the bark of A. nephrolepis (with 1.44 +- 0.05 mg/g, 0.47 +- 0.01 mg/g, 14.14 +- 0.38 mg/g for taxifolin, diosmin, and quercetin, respectively), which were close to the prediction values.	a. nephrolepis taxifolin
2	Preventive effect of Abelmoschus manihot (L.) Medik. on bone loss in the ovariectomised rats.Because the biggest culprit in pathogenesis of osteoporosis is oestrogen deficiency, hormone replacement therapy remained the mainstay for prevention. However most of postmenopausal women are more inclined to use natural alternative. We thus investigated the ability of Abelmoschus manihot, a herbal medicine to prevent bone loss in ovariectomised rats. Female Wistar rats were sham operated (SH: 8) or ovariectomised (OVX: 24). On day 0, OVX rats were randomly assigned to groups as follows: eight received 10% Abelmoschus manihot leaves in their diet, eight were given 15% Abelmoschus manihot leaves and eight were untreated (OVX). Compounds were mixed with a soy protein-free diet and given orally for 3 months. At necropsy, bone mineral density (BMD) in the femur and in its metaphyseal zone was lower in OVX than SH (p&lt;0.05). This osteopenia was prevented by consumption of the highest dose of Abelmoschus manihot leaves. Bone mineral content (BMC) in the total femur and its metaphyseal and diaphyseal subregions was improved, as well (p&lt;0.05). This could be explained by a trend towards decreased bone resorption. The lowest dose did not elicit any significant effect. In conclusion, Abelmoschus manihot consumption, at the dose of 15% in the diet, provided bone-sparing effects by improving both BMD and BMC.	abelmoschus manihot osteoporosis
1	Field evaluation of repellency of a polyherbal essential oil against blackflies and its dermal toxicity using rat model.In the present study we have evaluated the repellent activity of mixture of Curcuma longa, Zanthoxylum limonella and Pogostemon heyneanus essential oils in 1:1:2 ratio at 5%, 10% and 20% concentration against blackflies in northeastern India. Initially the essential oil mixture tested here has been found effective against Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The average protection recorded in 20% concentration (170.56 +- 4.0; 95% CI = 162.09-179.02) was higher as compared to other two concentrations (F = 90.2; p&lt;0.0001; df = 53). Percentage repellency and repellency index was found to be higher in 20% concentration (p &lt;= 0.017). No appreciable clinical and behavioral signs were observed in the acute dermal toxicity using rat model. No changes were observed in biochemical profiles of treatment group animals. Similarly, no prominent lesions were observed in vital organs of treatment in both the sexes. The study concludes that tested repellent is safe for use and has multi-insects repellent property.	pogostemon heyneanus essential oil
3	Hypnotic effect of jujubosides from Semen Ziziphi Spinosae.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Semen Ziziphi Spinosae, the seed of Ziziphus jujuba Mill. var. spinosa (bunge) Hu ex H.F. Chow has been widely used in treating insomnia and anxiety. AIM OF THE STUDY: In this study, we investigated the hypnotic effect of jujubosides, one of the major components (saponin) of Semen Ziziphi Spinosae, in both day and night period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After the administration of jujubosides (9 mg/kg once per day for 3 days), sleep parameters were examined by EEG and EMG analysis in normal rats and the action of jujubosides on pentobarbital-induced sleep assessed by the loss-of righting reflex. RESULTS: During daytime (9:00-15:00), jujubosides significantly increased the total sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep without significant influence on non-REM (NREM) sleep. During nighttime (21:00-3:00), jujubosides significantly increased the total sleep and NREM sleep especially the light sleep while showed no significant effect on REM sleep and slow wave sleep (SWS). In pentobarbital-treated mice, jujubosides significantly augmented the hypnotic effect of pentobarbital (45 mg/kg, i.p.), proved by increasing sleep time and this augmentative effect was potentiated by 5-hydroxytryptophan (2mg/kg, i.p.). Furthermore, jujubosides inhibited the para-chlorophenylalanine-induced suppression of pentobarbital-induced hypnosis. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that the hypnotic effect of jujubosides on normal rats may be influenced by circadian rhythm and the serotonergic system may involve in the hypnotic effect of jujubosides. Jujubosides may be good source of lead compounds for novel hypnotics.	jujubosides anxiety
1	Anti-inflammatory activity of (E)-1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl) butadiene from Zingiber cassumunar Roxb.This study aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory activity of (E)-1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl) butadiene (DMPBD), isolated from Zingiber cassumunar Roxb., using in vivo and in vitro models. The results show that DMPBD dose-dependently inhibited the rat ear edema induced by ethyl phenylpropiolate (EPP), arachidonic acid (AA) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) and it was more potent than any other standard drugs being used. In EPP-induced edema IC(50) of DMPBD and oxyphenbutazone were 21 and 136nmol per ear, respectively. The IC(50) of DMPBD and phenidone were 60 and 2520nmol per ear, respectively, in AA-induced edema whereas DMPBD was 11 times more potent than diclofenac in TPA-induced edema (IC(50)=660 and 7200pmol per ear, respectively). DMPBD and diclofenac inhibited the rat paw edema induced by carrageenan but not by platelet activating factor (PAF). In in vitro study DMPBD, aspirin and phenidone inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation with IC(50) of 0.35, 0.43 and 0.03mM, respectively. Whereas IC(50) of these agents in ADP, AA and PAF inductions were 4.85, 3.98 and 1.30mM; 0.94, 0.13 and 0.04mM; and 1.14, 6.96 and 2.40mM, respectively. These results indicate that DMPBD possesses a potent anti-inflammatory activity through the inhibition of CO and LO pathways and seems to have more prominent effects on the LO pathway.	zingiber cassumunar roxb (e)-1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl) butadiene
2	Antioxidant and antiproliferative activities of Abrus precatorius leaf extracts--an in vitro study.BACKGROUND: The use of traditional medicine at the primary health care level is widespread and plant-based treatments are being recommended for curing various diseases by traditional medical practitioners all over the world. The phytochemicals present in the fruits, vegetables and medicinal plants are getting attention day-by-day for their active role in the prevention of several human diseases. Abrus precatorius is a widely distributed tropical medicinal plant with several therapeutic properties. Therefore in the present study, A. precatorius leaf extracts were examined for their antioxidant and cytotoxic properties in vitro in order to discover resources for new lead structures or to improve the traditional medicine. METHODS: In this study, antioxidant and antiproliferative properties of the different leaf extracts (hexane, ethyl acetate, ethanol and water) from A. precatorius were investigated along with the quantification of the polyphenol and flavonoid contents. The ability of deactivating free radicals was extensively investigated with in vitro biochemical methods like DPPH( ), ( )OH, NO, SO(2-) scavenging assays and inhibition capability of Fe(II)-induced lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, antiproliferative activities using different human cancer cell lines and primary cell line was carried out by MTT method. RESULTS: Total phenolic content and total flavonoid content of the extracts were found in the range of 1.65 +- 0.22 to 25.48 +- 0.62 GAE mg/g dw and 6.20 +- 0.41 to 17.16 +- 1.04 QE mg/g dw respectively. The experimental results further revealed that A. precatorius extracts showed strong antiradical properties, capable to chelate Fe(2+) and possess good inhibition ability of lipid peroxidation. In addition, as a first step towards the identification of phytoconstituents endowed with potent chemopreventive activities, we evaluated the inhibitory effects of A. precatorius extracts on the proliferation of four different human tumour cell lines such as human colon adenocarcinoma cells (Colo-205), human retinoblastoma cancer cells (Y79), human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2) and Leukemia cells (SupT1). Ethanol extract (APA) and ethyl acetate extract (APE) of A. precatorius had apparent capabilities of inhibiting the survival of tested human cancer cell lines. Moreover, it was observed that the A. precatorius extracts did not inhibit the growth of mice peritoneal macrophages, thus confirming that plants extracts are selective against the cancer cell lines. CONCLUSION: This work provides a scientific support for the high antioxidant and antiproliferative activity of this plant and thus it may find potential applications in the treatment of the diseases caused by ROS. Further studies are needed to confirm in vivo anti-tumorgenicity and subsequent chemical characterization of the active molecule(s).	a. precatorius Leukemia
2	Meta-analysis of the effect of herbal supplement on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: A variety of herbs has been used in traditional medicine for the treatment of diabetes. However, evidence is limited regarding the efficacy of individual herbs for glycemic control. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of herbal supplement on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Randomized controlled trials were identified through electronic searches (MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) up until February 2011, historical searches of relevant articles and personal contact with experts in the area. Studies were included in the meta-analysis if they were (1) randomized placebo-controlled trial of single herb aimed at assessing glycemic control in type 2 diabetes, (2) of at least 8 weeks duration, and (3) reporting HbA(1c). Treatment effect was estimated with mean difference in the final value of HbA(1c) and FBG between the treatment and the placebo groups. RESULTS: Nine randomized, placebo-controlled trials (n = 487 patients) were identified. Ipomoea batatas, Silybum marianum and Trigonella foenum-graecum significantly improved glycemic control, whereas Cinnamomum cassia did not. The pooled mean differences in HbA(1c) were -0.30% (95% CI -0.04% to -0.57%; P = 0.02), -1.92% (95% CI -0.51% to -3.32%; P = 0.008), and -1.13% (95% CI -0.11% to -2.14%; P = 0.03), respectively, for Ipomoea batatas, Silybum marianum, and Trigonella foenum-graecum. The corresponding values for FBG were -10.20mg/dL (95% CI -5.32 mg/dL to -15.08 mg/dL; P&lt;0.0001) and -38.05 mg/dL (95% CI -9.54 mg/dL to -66.57 mg/dL; P = 0.009), respectively, for Ipomoea batatas and Silybum marianum. CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence suggests that supplementation with Ipomoea batatas, Silybum marianum, and Trigonella foenum-graecum may improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. Such effect was not observed with Cinnamomum cassia. Given the limitations of the available studies and high heterogeneity of the study results for milk thistle and fenugreek, further high quality, large controlled trials using standardized preparation are warranted to better elucidate the effects of these herbs on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes patients.	milk thistle diabetes
1	Separation and purification of saponins from Semen Ziziphus jujuba and their sedative and hypnotic effects.Semen Ziziphus jujuba (SZJ) has long been used in Chinese traditional medicine for the treatment of anxiety and insomnia because of its effect of decreasing monoaminergic system activity; saponins are thought to be the main bioactive factors. To investigate the sedative and hypnotic effects of saponins from SZJ, silica gel column chromatography and thin-layer chromatography were used to purify the crude extract of total saponins from SZJ. High-performance liquid chromatography showed that saponins from SZJ comprised two components, compounds I and II. Animal tests were conducted using these two compounds to compare their sedative and hypnotic effects. Results showed that both compounds had a significant effect (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01) on walking time compared with that of the control group. Compound I had a significant effect on coordinated movement (P &lt; 0.05). Both compounds prolonged the suprathreshold barbiturate induced sleeping time (P &lt; 0.05). The number of sleeping animals increased by 30% and 20% for compounds I and II, respectively, under the subthreshold dose of sodium barbital.	ziziphus jujuba saponins
1	Effects of Tapinanthus globiferus and Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides extracts on human leukocytes in vitro.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at investigating the genotoxicity and cytotoxicity effect of Tapinanthus globiferus and Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides to human leukocytes. In addition, the reductive potential and the chemical composition of the two plant extracts were also determined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human leukocytes were obtained from healthy volunteer donors. The genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of T. globiferus and Z. zanthoxyloides were assessed using the comet assay and trypan blue exclusion, respectively. The antioxidant activity of the plant extracts was evaluated by the reducing power assay. Furthermore, high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector was used to characterize and quantify the constituents of these plants. RESULTS: T. globiferus (10-150 microg/mL) was neither genotoxic nor cytotoxic at the concentrations tested, suggesting that it can be consumed safely at relatively high concentrations. However, Z. zanthoxyloides showed cytoxicity and genotoxicity to human leukocytes at the highest concentration tested (150 microg/mL). In addition, the total reducing power of T. globiferus was found higher than Z. zanthoxyloides in potassium ferricyanide reduction. Both plants extract contained flavonoids (rutin and quercetin) and phenolic acids (chlorogenic and caffeic). CONCLUSION: The results obtained support the fact that some caution should be paid regarding the dosage and the frequency of use of Z. zanthoxyloides extract.	z. zanthoxyloides quercetin
3	Lonchocarpine Increases Nrf2/ARE-Mediated Antioxidant Enzyme Expression by Modulating AMPK and MAPK Signaling in Brain Astrocytes.Lonchocarpine is a phenylpropanoid compound isolated from Abrus precatorius that has anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, and antiepileptic activities. In the present study, we investigated the antioxidant effects of lonchocarpine in brain glial cells and analyzed its molecular mechanisms. We found that lonchocarpine suppressed reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cell death in hydrogen peroxide-treated primary astrocytes. In addition, lonchocarpine increased the expression of antioxidant enzymes, such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), which are all under the control of Nrf2/antioxidant response element (ARE) signaling. Further, mechanistic studies showed that lonchocarpine increases the nuclear translocation and DNA binding of Nrf2 to ARE as well as ARE-mediated transcriptional activities. Moreover, lonchocarpine increased the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and three types of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). By treating astrocytes with each signaling pathway-specific inhibitor, AMPK, c-jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK were identified to be involved in lonchocarpine-induced HO-1 expression and ARE-mediated transcriptional activities. Therefore, lonchocarpine may be a potential therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative diseases that are associated with oxidative stress.	lonchocarpine neurodegenerative diseases
1	Antimicrobial effect against different bacterial strains and bacterial adaptation to essential oils used as feed additives.The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity and determine the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the essential oils derived from Origanum vulgare (oregano), Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree), Cinnamomum cassia (cassia), and Thymus vulgaris (white thyme) against Salmonella Typhimurium, Salmonella Enteritidis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. The study also investigated the ability of these different bacterial strains to develop adaptation after repetitive exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of these essential oils. The MBC of the essential oils studied was determined by disc diffusion and broth dilution methods. All essential oils showed antimicrobial effect against all bacterial strains. In general, the development of adaptation varied according to the bacterial strain and the essential oil (tea tree &gt; white thyme &gt; oregano). Therefore, it is important to use essential oils at efficient bactericidal doses in animal feed, food, and sanitizers, since bacteria can rapidly develop adaptation when exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of these oils. 	thyme essential oils
1	Active compound diffusivity of particle size reduced S. aromaticum and C. cassia fused starch edible films and the shelf life of mutton (Capra aegagrus hircus) meat.In the present study, mathematical models were used to examine the effect of active compound diffusion from edible film (supplemented with S. aromaticum and C. cassia) on the microbial, physical and chemical quality of mutton stored at 4 and 10 C. Cinnamaldehyde and eugenol release from edible film into liquid was found to be 80% and 75% of the equilibrium concentration. Active compound release into meat was 42-51% for cinnamaldehyde and 38-48% for eugenol, in storage temperatures of 4-15 C. Developed mathematical models showed the diffusivity of cinnamaldehyde (0.45x10-15+-0.04x10-15) and eugenol (0.63x10-10+-0.01x10-10) into meat, which was about 40% of that in liquid medium. On comparing physical, chemical and microbial results, shelf life of mutton meat was found to be increased by 1week at storage temperature of 10 C and 3weeks at storage temperature of 4 C.	s. aromaticum eugenol
1	Optimization of subcritical extraction process for cinnamon (Cinnamomum Cassia Blume) using response surface methodology.Subcritical extraction was optimized to maximize the extraction yield of flavoring compounds from cinnamon. The extracts of cinnamon were obtained at three different levels of extraction temperature (110-130  C), time (20-60 min), and pressure (20-40 bar). Response surface methodology was used in order to optimize the subcritical extraction process. The suitability of each independent variable in the second-order polynomial regression model was evaluated on the extraction yield and flavoring compound contents. For optimum extraction yield, the optimum temperature, time, and pressure were determined as 130  C, 60 min, and 26.63 bar, respectively. The contents of the flavoring compound predicted at optimum conditions were as follows: 10.01 mg/g at 110  C, 20 min, and 20 bar for coumarin; 4.95 mg/g at 110  C, 20 min, and 32 bar for cinnamic acid; 55 mg/g at 110  C, 34.62 min, and 37 bar for cinnamldehyde; and 4.92 mg/g at 110.9  C, 20 min, and 20 bar for cinnamyl alcohol.	cinnamomum cassia cinnamyl alcohol
2	In vitro anti-Helicobacter pylori action of 30 Chinese herbal medicines used to treat ulcer diseases.Infection by Helicobacter pylori has been ascertained to be an important etiologic impetus leading usually to chronic active gastritis and gastric ulcer with growing incidences worldwide. Utilizing as the test pathogen a standard and five clinic strains of Helicobacter pylori, the antibacterial action was assessed in vitro with ethanol extracts of 30 Chinese herbal medicines which have been frequently prescribed since ancient times for treating gastritis-like disorders. Among the 30 tested materials, the ethanol extracts of Abrus cantoniensis (Fabaceae), Saussurea lappa (Asteraceae) and Eugenia caryophyllata (Myrtaceae) were strongly inhibitory to all test strains (MICs: approximately 40 microg/ml), and Hippophae rhamnoides (Elaeagnaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii (Liliaceae), Magnolia officinalis and Schisandra chinensis (Magnoliaceae), Corydalis yanhusuo (Papaveraceae), Citrus reticulata (Rutaceae), Bupleurum chinense and Ligusticum chuanxiong (Apiaceae) substantially active with MICs close to 60.0 microg/ml. As to antibacterial actions of the aqueous extracts of the same drugs, those derived from Cassia obtusifolia (Fabaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii and Eugenia caryophyllata were remarkably inhibitory against all the six Helicobacter pylori strains (MICs: approximately 60 microg/ml). The work compared almost quantitatively the magnitude of the anti-Helicobacter pylori actions of the 30 most prescribed gastritis-treating Chinese herbal drugs, and located as well some source plants where potent anti-Helicobacter pylori phytochemicals could be characterized.	citrus reticulata ulcer diseases
3	Acute demyelinating encephalitis after jequirity pea ingestion (Abrus precatorius).INTRODUCTION: Castor and jequirity beans are uncommon causes of poisoning. The more common but less severe castor poisoning is well described, but jequirity bean (Abrus Precatorius) poisoning is rare. The toxicity is attributed to toxalbumins (ricin and abrin) that act by inhibiting protein synthesis. Their use as agents of biological warfare, mechanisms of action, and clinical features of poisoning are summarized. CASE REPORT: A 30-year-old previously healthy female presented with bloody diarrhea and deep coma following ingestion of 3-4 seeds of a plant called 'ratti.' Investigations, including an MRI brain scan, showed evidence of acute demyelinating encephalitis. The patient died three days later due to progressive central nervous system depression. DISCUSSION: This is a previously unreported manifestation of jequirity bean poisoning. Demyelination is immune-mediated, and Abrus is a well-known immuno-modulator and stimulator. A possible immunological pathogenic mechanism is hypothesized.	toxalbumins bloody diarrhea
2	Effect of the herbal medicine dai-kenchu-to on gastrointestinal motility in patients with megacystis-microcolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIHS) and chronic idiopathic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIIP): report of two cases.Dai-kenchu-to (DKT), a traditional Japanese herbal medicine (Kampo medicine), composed of zanthoxylum fruit, ginseng root, dried ginger rhizome and malt sugar, is clinically effective for postoperative ileus and chronic constipation. MMIHS and CIIP are severe motility disorder associated with high morbidity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of DKT on functional intestinal obstruction. DKT was clinically effective for gastrointestinal motility in a case with MMIHS, but not effective in one with CIIP. MMIHS and CIIP are speculated to have different pathogenesis regarding gastrointestinal pseudo-obstruction based upon the effect of this drug.	ginseng gastrointestinal motility
1	Anthelmintic efficacy of cinnamaldehyde and cinnamic acid from cortex cinnamon essential oil against Dactylogyrus intermedius.Utilization of chemical pesticide to control monogenean diseases is often restricted in many countries due to the development of pesticide resistance and concerns of chemical residues and environmental contamination. Thus, the use of antiparasitic agents from plants has been explored as a possible way for controlling monogenean infections. Extracts from Cinnamomum cassia were investigated under in vivo conditions against Dactylogyrus intermedius in goldfish. The two bioactive compounds, cinnamaldehyde and cinnamic acid, were identified using nuclear magnetic resonance and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The 48 h median effective concentrations (EC(50)) for these compounds against D. intermedius were 0 57 and 6 32 mg L(-1), respectively. The LD(50) of cinnamaldehyde and cinnamic acid were 13 34 and 59 66 mg L(-1) to goldfish in 48 h acute toxicity tests, respectively. These data confirm that cinnamaldehyde is effective against D. intermedius, and the cinnamaldehyde exhibits potential for the development of a candidate antiparasitic agent.	cinnamon cinnamaldehyde
1	Differentiation of configurations of the phenylbutenoid dimer derivatives from Zingiber cassumunar by tandem mass spectrometry.High-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray tandem mass spectrometry was developed to distinguish isomers and compounds of similar structures with different configurations in the rhizomes of Z. cassumunar. Energy-resolved breakdown curves were utilized to differentiate four compounds. Compounds 2 (3R,4S) and 4 (3R,4R) were a pair of stereoisomers which could be distinguished easily by breakdown curves. The breakdown curve of compound 1 was identical to that of compound 2, which suggested that the configuration of compound 1 was (3R,4S) or (3S,4R). The breakdown curve of compound 3 was completely different from those of compounds 1, 2 and 4, and it might be that the configuration of the double bond of compound 3 was different from the other three compounds. Hence, the described method using breakdown curves has great potential in the distinguishing of isomers and compounds of similar structure with different configurations.	z. cassumunar phenylbutenoid
1	Linalool Affects the Antimicrobial Efficacy of Essential Oils.The high concentrations of essential oils are generally required to receive microbial purity of the products (cosmetics, medicine). On the other hand, their application due to the high concentration of essential oils may be limited by changes in organoleptic and textural quality of the products, as well as they cause irritation and allergies in users. Addition of linalool to essential oil may significantly enhance its antimicrobial effectiveness and reduce their concentrations in products, taking advantage of their synergistic and additive effects. The aim of the study was to compare antimicrobial activity of essential oil alone and in combination with linalool. The antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Thymus vulgaris, Juniperus communis, Pelargonium graveolens, Citrus bergamia, Citrus grandis, Lavandula angustifolia, Cinnamomum zeylanicum, Melaleuca alternifolia, Syzygium aromaticum, linalool and their combination was investigated against bacteria and fungi using the disc diffusion method. The addition of linalool to S. aromaticum oil in a synergistic manner enhanced its antimicrobial efficacy against P. aeruginosa and A. brasiliensis. Moreover, the additive interaction between this oil and linalool was observed against S. aureus, E. coli and C. albicans. It was also found that linalool in an additive manner increased the antimicrobial effectiveness of T. vulgaris oil against P. aeruginosa. The antimicrobial properties of mixture of essential oils with their active constituents may be used for creating new strategies to maintain microbiological purity of products. 	t. vulgaris linalool
1	Enhanced repellency of binary mixtures of Zanthoxylum piperitum pericarp steam distillate or Zanthoxylum armatum seed oil constituents and Calophyllum inophyllum nut oil and their aerosols to Stomoxys calcitrans.BACKGROUND: The repellency to stable fly, Stomoxys calcitrans (L.), of Zanthoxylum piperitum (L.) DC pericarp steam distillate (ZP-SD), Zanthoxylum armatum DC seed oil (ZA-SO) and their constituents alone or in combination with Calophyllum inophyllum L. nut oil (CI-NO), as well as six aerosol formulations containing ZP-SD or ZP-SO and CI-NO, was compared with that of a synthetic repellent, DEET, using an exposed human hand bioassay. RESULTS: At 0.20 mg cm(-2), ZP-SD treatments resulted in 91 and 68% repellency following 30 and 60 min exposure respectively, while DEET gave 100 and 84% repellency. ZA-SO was less effective than ZP-SD. At 0.2 mg cm(-2), the most active constituents, cuminaldehyde, cuminyl alcohol, limonene and methyl cinnamate, gave 82, 74, 74 and 64% repellency at 30 min respectively, but DEET gave 100 and 87% repellency at 30 and 60 min. An increase in effectiveness and duration of repellency was produced by binary mixtures of ZP-SD, ZA-SO or bioactive constituents (each 0.01 mg cm(-2)) and CI-NO (0.99 mg cm(-2)). The repellency of aerosols containing 2.5% ZP-SD or 2.5% ZA-SO and 2.5% CI-NO was comparable with that of 5% DEET aerosol. CONCLUSION: Mixtures formulated from ZP-SD, ZA-SO or bioactive constituents and CI-NO could be useful as potential repellents for the control of stable fly populations in light of global efforts to reduce the level of highly toxic synthetic repellents.	zanthoxylum piperitum (l.) dc cuminaldehyde
1	Cinnamaldehyde inhibits inflammation of human synoviocyte cells through regulation of Jak/Stat pathway and ameliorates collagen-induced arthritis in rats.Cinnamaldehyde (Cin), a bioactive cinnamon essential oil from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) herb Cinnamomum cassia, has been reported to have multi-pharmacological activities including anti-inflammation. However, its role and molecular mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity in musculoskeletal tissues remains unclear. Here, we first investigated the effects and molecular mechanisms of Cin in human synoviocyte cells. Then in vivo therapeutic effect of Cin on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) also studied. Cell cytotoxicity was measured by CCK-8 Assay. Pro-inflammatory cytokine expression was evaluated using qPCR and ELISA. Protein expression was measured by western blotting. The in vivo effect of Cin (75 mg/kg/day) was evaluated in rats with CIA by gavage administration. Disease progression was assessed by clinical scoring, radiographic, and histological examinations. Cin significantly inhibited IL-1beta-induced interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) release from human synoviocyte cells. The molecular analysis revealed that Cin impaired IL-6-induced janus kinase 2 (JAK2), signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT3 signaling pathway by inhibiting the phosphorylation of JAK2, STAT1 and STAT3, without affecting NF-kappaB pathway. Cin reduced collagen-induced swollen paw volume of arthritic rats. The anti-inflammation effects of Cin were associated with decreased severity of arthritis, joint swelling, and reduced bone erosion and destruction. Furthermore, serum IL-6 level was decreased when Cin administered therapeutically to CIA rats. Cin suppresses IL-1beta-induced inflammation in synoviocytes through the JAK/STAT pathway and alleviated collagen-induced arthritis in rats. These data indicated that Cin might be a potential TCM-derived disease modifying anti-rheumatic herbal drug. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Cin suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion in RA synoviocyte cells by JAK/STAT pathway. Cin ameliorates collagen-induced arthritis in rats. Cin is a potential TCM-derived disease modifying anti-rheumatic herbal drug.	cinnamomum cassia Cin
2	Evaluation of six plant species used traditionally in the treatment and control of diabetes mellitus in South Africa using in vitro methods.CONTEXT: Numerous plants are used by the local communities of South Africa for the treatment and management of type II diabetes. OBJECTIVES: For this study, we undertook a survey of the plants sold for the management of diabetes in the town of Newcastle, South Africa. Identified plants were subsequently evaluated for their in vitro antidiabetic activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plants were identified through an interview with a herbalist at the market. Antidiabetic activity of extracts of purchased plants was evaluated using in vitro alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase activity, as well as islets of Langerhans excretory activity. RESULTS: Senna alexandrina Mill. (Fabaceae), Cymbopogon citrates Stapf. (Poaceae), Cucurbita pepo L. (Cucuribitaceae), Nuxia floribunda Benth. (Stilbaceae), Hypoxis hemerocallidea Fisch. and Mey (Hypoxidaceae), and Cinnamomum cassia Blume (Lauraceae) were identified. The hexane extract of S. alexandrina (EC50=0.083 mg/ml), ethyl acetate extract of H. hemerocallidea (EC50=0.29 mg/ml), and methanol extracts of Cymbopogon citratus (EC50=0.31 mg/ml) and Cinnamomum cassia (EC50=0.12 mg/ml) had the highest alpha-amylase inhibitory activity, albeit lower than acarbose (EC50=0.50 mg/ml). All the plants had good alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity (&gt;50%) with the exception of some methanol (Cinnamomum cassia, N. floribunda, and Cymbopogon citratus) and acetone extracts (Cucurbita pepo and N. floribunda). Only the H. hemerocallidea acetone extract had an insulin stimulatory effect (2.5 U/ml at 8 mug/ml). CONCLUSION: All the evaluated plants demonstrated inhibitory activity against the specific GIT enzyme systems evaluated. Only H. hemerocallidea had insulin secretory activity, adding evidence to the traditional use of these purchased plants in the management of the type II diabetic post-prandial hyperglycemia.	h. hemerocallidea type ii diabetic post-prandial hyperglycemia
1	Aroma constituents and alkylamides of red and green huajiao (Zanthoxylum bungeanum and Zanthoxylum schinifolium).Huajiao denotes the fruits of various species of Zanthoxylum in the plant family Rutaceare used for cooking. The two most commercially popular species are bungeanum (red huajiao) and schinifolium (green huajiao). Fresh huajiao has a very high content of essential oil, up to 11%, which is described as having fresh, spicy, floral, cooling, and green aroma notes. A comprehensive analysis of the essential oils by GC-MS using advanced peak deconvolution and data processing software, revealed many overlapping components. A total of 120 aroma compounds for each species has been found. In the essential oils, linalyl acetate (15%), linalool (13%), and limonene (12%) are the major components of red huajiao, whereas linalool (29%), limonene (14%), and sabinene (13%) are the major components of green huajiao. For estimation of the aroma contribution of individual components, a new concept, "aroma character impact value" (ACI), is introduced as the percentage of the ratio of the concentration of an aroma component to its odor threshold value. Despite the differences in major components, both species have six common compounds of top aroma character impact: linalool, alpha-terpineol, myrcene, 1,8-cineole, limonene, and geraniol. The tingling sensation of huajiao is caused mainly by the alkylamide hydroxy-alpha-sanshool. The tingling compound decomposes easily under hydrolytic conditions or under UV light.

1	Characterization of potent anticholinesterase plant oil based microemulsion.In the present study, essential oils of three edible Thai plants, Cymbopogon citratus (Gramineae), Citrus hystrix (Rutaceae) and Zingiber cassumunar (Zingiberaceae) were comparatively tested for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitory activities using Ellman's colorimetric method. C. citratus oil exhibited the highest activity with IC(50) values of 0.34+-0.07mul/ml and 2.14+-0.18mul/ml against BChE and AChE activity, respectively. It was further investigated whether microemulsions of this oil could be obtained. The effects of type of surfactant and co-surfactant as well as pH and ionic strength on the phase behavior of the oil/water system were investigated. Brij 97, Triton X-114, Tween 20 and Tween 85 were employed as surfactant whereas ethanol and hexanol were used as cosurfactants. The size analysis, electrical conductivity measurements and cholinesterase inhibition assays were done in selected microemulsion. The results revealed that the type and concentration of surfactant and co-surfactant exhibited a distinct influence on the C. citratus oil microemulsions. Moreover, the inhibitory activities of the microemulsion formulation were remarkable.	cymbopogon citratus citratus oil
2	Bioactivity of cinnamon with special emphasis on diabetes mellitus: a review.Cinnamon is the oldest spice and has been used by several cultural practices for centuries. In addition to its culinary uses, cinnamon possesses a rising popularity due to many stated health benefits. Out of the large number of cinnamon species available, Cinnamomum aromaticum (Cassia) and Cinnamomum zeylanicum have been subjected to extensive research. Available in vitro and in vivo evidence indicates that cinnamon may have multiple health benefits, mainly in relation to hypoglycaemic activity. Furthermore, the therapeutic potential of cinnamon is stated also to be brought about by its anti-microbial, anti-fungal, antiviral, antioxidant, anti-tumour, blood pressure-lowering, cholesterol and lipid-lowering and gastro-protective properties. This article provides a summary of the scientific literature available on both C. aromaticum and C. zeylanicum. All studies reported here have used cinnamon bark and its products. Although almost all the animal models have indicated a pronounced anti-diabetic activity of both cinnamon species, conflicting results were observed with regard to the few clinical trials available. Therefore, the necessity of evaluating the effects of cinnamon for its therapeutic potential through well-defined and adequately powered randomized controlled clinical trials is emphasized, before recommendations are made for the use of cinnamon as an effective treatment for humans.	cinnamon diabetic
1	Characterization of the last step of lignin biosynthesis in Zinnia elegans suspension cell cultures.The last step of lignin biosynthesis in Zinnia elegans suspension cell cultures (SCCs) catalyzed by peroxidase (ZePrx) has been characterized. The k(3) values shown by ZePrx for the three monolignols revealed that sinapyl alcohol was the best substrate, and were proportional to their oxido/reduction potentials, signifying that these reactions are driven exclusively by redox thermodynamic forces. Feeding experiments demonstrate that cell wall lignification in SCCs is controlled by the rate of supply of H(2)O(2). The results also showed that sites for monolignol beta-O-4 cross-coupling in cell walls may be saturated, suggesting that the growth of the lineal lignin macromolecule is not infinite.	zinnia elegans lignin
1	Identification of the potential active components of Abelmoschus manihot in rat blood and kidney tissue by microdialysis combined with ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry.In this paper, microdialysis combining with ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) was applied to simultaneously identify components in blood and kidney dialysis after oral administration of Abelmoschus manihot extract. Microdialysis probe was implanted in the jugular vein and the kidney medulla, respectively; microdialysis samples were collected continuously, transferred to microtubes and analyzed by UPLC-Q-TOF/MS. The components in microdialysis samples were separated by an UPLC HSS T3 column and eluted with acetonitrile and water (containing 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The results showed that unbound constituents in blood circulation of the rat include hyperoside, isoquercitrin, quercetin monoglucuronide, quercetin-3'-O-glucoside, quercetin, myricetin, and hibifolin while unbound constituents in kidney are hyperoside, isoquercitrin, quercetin monoglucuronide, which might be the potential active components in vivo. The developed method was simple and reliable, and could be adopted to rapidly screen and identify potential active components contributing to pharmacological effects of TCM and to better clarify its action mechanism.	abelmoschus manihot hyperoside
1	Crystal structure of abrin-a at 2.14 A.The crystal structure of abrin-a, a type II ribosome-inactivating protein from the seeds of Abrus precatorius, has been determined from a novel crystalline form by the molecular replacement method using the coordinates of ricin. The structure has been refined at 2.14 A to a R-factor of 18.9%. The root-mean-square deviations of bond lengths and angles from the standard values are 0.013 A and 1.82 degrees, respectively. The overall protein folding is similar to that of ricin, but there are differences in the secondary structure, mostly of the A-chain. Several parts of the molecular surface differ significantly; some of them are quite near the active site cleft, and probably influence ribosome recognition. The positions of invariant active site residues remain the same, except the position of Tyr74. Two water molecules of hydrogen-bonded active site residues have been located in the active site cleft. Both of them may be responsible for hydrolyzing the N-C glycosidic bond. The current abrin-a structure is lactose free; this is probably essential for abrin-a crystallization. The B-chain is a glycoprotein, and the positions of several sugar residues of two sugar chains linked to earlier predicted glycosylation sites were determined. One of the sugar chains is a bridge between two neighboring molecules, since one of its mannose residues is connected to the galactose binding site of the neighboring molecule. Another sugar chain covers the surface of the B-chain.	abrus precatorius mannose
1	In vivo and in vitro antiviral activity of hyperoside extracted from Abelmoschus manihot (L) medik.AIM: To assess the anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) effect of hyperoside extracted from Abelmoschus manihot (L) medik. METHODS: The human hepatoma Hep G2.2.15 cell culture system and duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) infection model were used as in vivo and in vitro models to evaluate the anti-HBV effects. RESULTS: In the cell model, the 50% toxic concentration of hyperoside was 0.115 g/L; the maximum nontoxic concentration was 0.05 g/L. On the maximum nontoxic concentrations, the inhibition rates of hyperoside on HBeAg and HBsAg in the 2.2.15 cells were 86.41% and 82.27% on d 8, respectively. In the DHBV infection model, the DHBV-DNA levels decreased significantly in the treatment of 0.05 g x kg(-1 ) x d(-1 ) and 0.10 g x kg(-1) x d(-1) dosage groups of hyperoside (P&lt;0.01). The inhibition of the peak of viremia was at the maximum at the dose of 0.10 g x kg(-1 ) x d(-1) and reached 60.79% on d 10 and 69.78% on d 13, respectively. CONCLUSION: These results suggested that hyperoside is a strong inhibitor of HBsAg and HBeAg secretion in 2.2.15 cells and DHBV-DNA levels in the HBV-infected duck model.	abelmoschus manihot (l) medik hyperoside
1	Combined analysis by GC (RI), GC-MS and 13C NMR of the supercritical fluid extract of Abies alba twigs.Two samples (leaves and twigs) of Abies alba Miller from Corsica were extracted using supercritical CO2 and their chemical compositions were compared with those of the essential oils obtained from the same batch of plant material. In total 45 components were identified using combined analysis by GC (RI), GC-MS and 13C NMR. It was observed that the contents of monoterpenes (mainly represented by limonene, alpha-pinene and camphene) were significantly lower in the supercritical fluid extract (SFE) than in the essential oil (EO). Conversely, the proportions of sesquiterpenes were much higher in CO2 extracts than in essential oils (around 30% vs 4%). Cis-abienol, a diterpene alcohol, was identified only in SFE, and the proportions of this constituent (7.5% and 17.3%) were determined using quantitative 13C NMR since it was under estimated using the standard conditions of GC.	abies alba essential oils
2	Antitumour effect of abrin on transplanted tumours in mice.Abrin, a galactose specific lectin was purified using sepharose 4B affinity column from seeds of Abrus precatorius. It exhibited antitumour activity in mice when used at a sublethal dose of 7.5 micrograms/kg every alternate day for 10 days. Both intralesional and intraperiloneal (i.p.) administration of abrin was effective in reducing solid tumour mass development induced by Dalton's Lymphoma Ascites (DLA) and Ehrlich's Ascites Carcinoma (EAC) cells. DLA cell line was more sensitive to abrin than EAC. Abrin when injected i.p. increased the life span of ascites tumour bearing mice. Abrin when used simultaneously with tumour cells brought about maximum antitumour effect. On developed tumour masses, abrin administration brought about significant reduction in tumour volume, especially in DLA induced tumours. Prophylactic administration of abrin was found ineffective.	abrus precatorius tumours
1	Comparison of the sedative and hypnotic effects of flavonoids, saponins, and polysaccharides extracted from Semen Ziziphus jujube.Semen Ziziphus jujube (SZJ), the seeds of Ziziphus jujuba Mill. var. spinosa, is a kind of traditional Chinese medicine used for its action on insomnia. In order to analyze the effective component, we investigated and compared the sedative and hypnotic effects of three kinds of compounds, flavonoids, saponins, and polysaccharides. Flavonoids, saponins, and polysaccharides were extracted from SZJ and orally administered to mice separately at 17 g kg(-1) per day for certain days before animal tests. Spontaneous motility and coordinated movement tests were used to observe the effects of the three kinds of compounds on the mouse behavior, and sodium barbital-induced sleeping time of mouse were tested to analyze the effects of the three kinds of compounds on the sleep of mouse. Results show that flavonoids and saponins caused a significant reduction of walking time and coordinated movement ability of mouse, significantly prolonged its sleeping time at 40 mg kg(-1), ip, subthreshold dose and increased the sleeping number of animals at 50 mg kg(-1), ip, superthreshold dose induced by coeliac injection of sodium barbital. Polysaccharides did not show any significance in all animal tests. Comparative analysis showed that saponins had a more effective sedative and hypnotic function than that of flavonoids, polysaccharides did not show a sedative and hypnotic effect.	ziziphus jujuba mill. var flavonoids
1	Caffeic Acid Phenethyl Ester from the Twigs of Cinnamomum cassia Inhibits Malignant Cell Transformation by Inducing c-Fos Degradation.The twigs of Cinnamomum cassia, commonly referred to as Cinnamomi Ramulus, are widely used as one of the primary ingredients in Chinese/Korean traditional medicines that have anticancer effects. However, the active constituents responsible for its anticancer effects and their molecular mechanisms still remain to be elucidated. Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) and caffeic acid (CA) were isolated for the first time from C. cassia using LC-MS-guided phytochemical isolation methods. CAPE significantly suppressed EGF- and TPA-induced cell transformation of JB6 P+ cells at sub-micromolar concentrations, whereas CA, a structurally similar compound to CAPE, had no such effect. The antiproliferative and chemopreventive activity of CAPE was found to arise through the inhibition of AP-1 transcriptional activity via the promotion of c-Fos degradation. These findings demonstrate that CAPE may contribute to the chemopreventive/chemotherapeutic effects of C. cassia through downregulating c-Fos.	c. cassia CAPE
1	Protective effect of total flavones of Abelmoschus manihot L. Medic against poststroke depression injury in mice and its action mechanism.Total flavones of Abelmoschus manihot L. Medic (TFA) is the major active component isolated from the traditional Chinese herb Abelmoschus manihot L. Medic. We investigated the protective effect of TFA against poststroke depression (PSD) injury in mice and its action mechanism. A mouse model of PSD was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MACO) 30 min/reperfusion, followed by isolation feeding and chronic unpredictable mild stress for 2 weeks. Treatment groups received TFA at three different doses (160, 80, and 40 mg/kg, p.o.) or fluoxetine (Flu, 2.5 mg/kg, p.o.) daily for 24 days. Change in behavior, brain tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were measured. The expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was detected by immunohistochemistry, and mRNA expression of BDNF and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Treatment with TFA (160, 80, and 40 mg/kg) significantly ameliorated mice escape-directed behavioral impairment induced by PSD, markedly reduced MDA levels, and increased the activity of SOD, GSH-Px close to normal levels. TFA administration also attenuated PSD-induced neuronal death/losses, upregulated expression of BDNF both at mRNA and protein levels, as well as CREB mRNA levels. TFA had a protective effect against PSD injury in mice. Cardioprotection involves the inhibition of lipid peroxidation and upregulation of BDNF-CREB levels in the hippocampus, which may also be important mechanism of its antidepressants. This potential protection makes TFA a promising therapeutic agent for the PSD.	abelmoschus manihot TFA
2	Mast cell stabilizing and antiallergic activity of Abrus precatorius in the management of asthma.OBJECTIVE: To investigate effects of ethanol extract of Abrus precatorius leaves (EAPL) on egg albumin induced mast cell degranulation in mice and passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in rats. METHODS: In present study ethanol extract of Abrus precatorius leaves (EAPL) at doses of 100, 125, 150 mg/kg i.p were evaluated for preliminary phytochemical screening, acute toxicity studies and egg albumin induced mast cell degranulation in mice and passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in rats. RESULTS: The results of present investigation showed that the LD(50) of EAPL is more than 1 300 mg/kg. EAPL (100-150 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly protect egg albumin induced degranulation of mast cell and inhibit area of leakage of dye in passive cutaneous anaphylaxis. Phytochemical studies observed presence of saponin, alkaloids, flavonoids, and glycosides. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion EAPL possesses anti asthmatic potential.	abrus precatorius asthma

1	FEMA GRAS assessment of natural flavor complexes: Cinnamomum and Myroxylon-derived flavoring ingredients.In 2015, the Expert Panel of the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association (FEMA) initiated a program for the re-evaluation of the safety of over 250 natural flavor complexes (NFCs) used as flavor ingredients. This publication, third in the series, considers NFCs composed primarily of constituents with the 3-phenyl-2-propenyl or a cinnamyl functional group, using the procedure outlined in 2005 and updated in 2018 to evaluate the safety of naturally-occurring mixtures for their intended use as flavor ingredients. The procedure relies on a complete chemical characterization of the NFC intended for commerce and organization of each NFC's chemical constituents into well-defined congeneric groups. The safety of the NFC is evaluated using the well-established and conservative threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) concept in addition to data on absorption, metabolism, and toxicology of members of the congeneric groups and the NFC under evaluation. Six NFCs from the Myroxylon and Cinnamomum genera, Balsam Oil, Peru (FEMA 2117), Tolu Balsam Extract (FEMA 3069), Cassia Bark Extract (FEMA 2257), Cassia Bark Oil (FEMA 2258), Cinnamon Bark Extract (FEMA 2290) and Cinnamon Bark Oil (FEMA 2291) were evaluated and affirmed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) under their conditions of intended use as flavor ingredients.

1	Characteristic differences in essential oil composition of six Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim. (Rutaceae) cultivars and their biological significance.Great variations have been found in composition and content of the essential oil of Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim. (Rutaceae), resulting from various factors such as harvest time, drying and extraction methods (Huang et al., 2006; Shao et al., 2013), solvent and herbal parts used (Zhang, 1996; Cao and Zhang, 2010; Wang et al., 2011). However, in terms of artificial introduction and cultivation, there is little research on the chemical composition of essential oil extracted from Z. bungeanum Maxim. cultivars, which have been introduced from different origins. In this study, the composition and content of essential oil from six cultivars (I-VI) have been investigated. They were introduced and cultivated for 11 years in the same cultivation conditions. Cultivars were as followings: Qin'an (I) cultivar originally introduced from Qin'an City in Gansu Province; Dahongpao A (II) from She County in Hebei Province; Dahongpao B (III) from Fuping County; Dahongpao C (IV) from Tongchuan City; Meifengjiao (V) from Feng County; and, Shizitou (VI) from Hancheng City, in Shaanxi Province, China. This research is expected to provide a theoretical basis for further introduction, cultivation, and commercial development of Z. bungeanum Maxim.	z. bungeanum maxim essential oil
1	Application of near-infrared spectroscopy in quality control and determination of adulteration of African essential oils.An evaluation has been made of the potential of near-infrared (NIR) technologies in the assessment of essential oil components and in the identification of individual essential oils. The results showed that cross-validation models are able to predict accurately almost all of the components of essential oils. In different cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum) and clove (Syzygium aromaticum) essential oils, which showed a similar composition, 23 components (representing 97.8-99.9% of the oil) were accurately predicted, as well as 20 components (93.0-99.1%) in Cinnamomum camphora (ravintsara), 32 components (92.3-98.1%) in Ravensara aromatica (ravensara), and 26 components (96.6-98.4%) in Lippia multiflora. For almost all of the components, the modelled and reference values obtained by GC-FID were highly correlated (r2 &gt; or = 0.985) and exhibited a low variance (less than 5%). The model was also able to discriminate between the ravintsara and ravensara essential oils. It was shown that two commercial oils labelled as R. aromatica were actually ravintsara (C. camphora), revealing the misidentification of these essential oils in the marketplace. The study demonstrates the application of NIR technology as a quality control tool for the rapid identification of individual essential oils, for product authentication, and for the detection of adulteration.	syzygium aromaticum essential oils
1	[Analysis and utilization value discussion of multiple chemical composition in different tissues of Abelmoschus manihot].This research is to analyze the resourceful chemical composition in different tissues (root, stem, leaf and flower) of Abelmoschus manihot and evaluate their utilizing value. The flavonoids, soluble polysaccharides, cellulose, nucleosides and amino acids in the different tissues of A. manihot were determined by HPLC coupled with UV-Vis spectrophotpmetry, and UPLC-TQ/MS. The flowers are rich in the resourceful chemical compositions of flavonoids which mainly consist of hyperoside, isoquercitrin, cotton-8-O-glucuronide, myricetin, quercetin-3'-O-glucoside, rutin and quercetin. The total content of these flavonoids is 25.450 mg g-1 in the flowers, while they are trace in the other tissues.Different tissues of A. manihot are rich in soluble polysaccharides and celluloses and the stems have the highest content(19.76%) of soluble polysaccharides, while the roots have the highest content (29.88%) of cellulose. Total of 21 amino acids and 9 nucleosides were detected in this plant, and the flowers have the highest content of amino acids(4.737 mg g-1), while the leaves have the highest content of nucleosides (1.474 mg g-1). A. manihot is rich in the resourceful chemical compositions, and its constituents and contents are various in different tissues of this plant.The results provided a scientific basis for the utilization and industrial development of A. manihot plants.	a. manihot quercetin
3	Simultaneous Detection of Flavonoids, Phenolic Acids and Alkaloids in Abri Herba and Abri Mollis Herba using Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry.INTRODUCTION: Abri Herba has remarkable properties, such as cleanup heat detoxification, dampness and activating blood circulation to dissipate blood stasis; as a result, it has been applied to treat acute or chronic hepatitis and mastitis. Abri mollis Herba is often used as Abri Herba. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was applied to compare the similarities and differences of the chemical compositions in the two types of medicinal materials. OBJECTIVE: To establish a high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous analysis of 15 flavonoids, two phenolic acids and three alkaloids in Abri Herba and Abri mollis Herba. METHODOLOGY: The chromatographic separation was performed on a C18 column with a mobile phase of methanol (A), acetonitrile (B) and 0.5% acetic acid in water (C) using gradient elution. The detection of the target compounds was performed in multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) mode using a hybrid quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with positive/negative ion-switching electrospray ionisation (ESI) source. RESULTS: The developed method is reliable, sensitive and specific. In addition, the method has been successfully applied to differentiate 15 batches of Abri Herba and 27 batches of Abri mollis Herba stems. Furthermore, a comparison of the contents among stems, roots and leaves from the same strain in seven batches of Abri mollis Herba and four batches of Abri Herba has also been performed. CONCLUSION: HPLC-MS/MS method is sensitive and selective and can be suitable for the reliable quality control of Abri mollis Herba and Abri Herba.	alkaloids hepatitis and mastitis
1	Antisickling activity of anthocyanins from Bombax pentadrum, Ficus capensis and Ziziphus mucronata: photodegradation effect.AIM OF THE STUDY: A survey was conducted in Lubumbashi city (Democratic Republic of Congo) in order to: (a) identify medicinal plants used by traditional healers in the management of sickle cell anaemia, (b) verify their antisickling activity in vitro, (c) determine the most active plants, and (d) verify if anthocyanins are responsible of the bioactivity and study their photodegradation effect. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Emmel test was used in vitro, for the antisickling activity assays of aqueous and ethanolic extracts of different parts of these plants when a UV lamp and solar irradiations were used to induce the photodegradation effect. RESULTS: The survey revealed that 13 medicinal plants are used in the treatment of drepanocytosis among which 12 plants exhibited the in vitro antisickling activity for at least one of the used parts or extracts. These plants are Bombax pentadrum, Bougainvillea sp., Byarsocarpus orientalis, Dalberigia bochmintaub, Diplorrhynbchus condolocarpus, Euphorbia heterophylla, Ficus capensis, Harungana madagascariensis, Parinari mobola, Pothmania witfchidii, Syzygium guineense, Temnocalys verdickii and Ziziphus mucronata of which four (Bombax pentadrum, Ficus capensis, Parinari mobola and Ziziphus mucronata) revealed a high antisickling activity. The biological activity of three of these plants is due to anthocyanins. The antisickling activity and photodegradation effect of anthocyanins extracts were studied and minimal concentration of normalization determined. The biological activity of Bombax pentadrum anthocyanins decreased to half of its value after 40 min of irradiation under a lamp emitting at a wavelength of 365 nm and after about 10h of solar irradiation. For Ziziphus mucronata and Ficus capensis, the antisickling activity decreased to half after about 6h under a lamp exposition and after about 50h of solar exposition. CONCLUSION: In vitro Antisickling activity justifies the use of these plants by traditional healers and this activity would be due to anthocyanins. But these natural pigments are instable towards UV-Visible irradiations. The conservation of these plants should then be performed in a shield from the sun radiation.	ziziphus mucronata anthocyanins
1	High-performance liquid chromatography--two wavelength detection of triterpenoid acids from the fruits of Ziziphus jujuba containing various cultivars in different regions and classification using chemometric analysis.A simple and sensitive HPLC-DAD method has been developed for the first time to simultaneously determine 10 triterpenoid acids (ceanothic acid, alphitolic acid, zizyberanal acid, zizyberanalic acid, epiceanothic acid, ceanothenic acid, betulinic acid, oleanolic acid, ursonic acid and zizyberenalic acid) in the dried fruit of Ziziphus jujuba (called Dazao) which has been widely used as one of the traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs). This HPLC assay was performed on a reversed-phase C(18) column (250 mm x 4.6mm, 5 microm) with the column temperature at 35 degrees C. The mobile phase was composed of A (acetonitrile) and B (0.05% aqueous phosphoric acid, v/v). The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min and the detection wave length was set at 205 nm for reference compounds 1-9 and 238 nm for reference compound 10. All calibration curves showed good linear regression (r(2)&gt;0.9999) within the test range. The established method showed good precision and accuracy with overall intra-day and inter-day variations of 0.43-1.72% and 0.53-2.45%, respectively, and overall recoveries of 94.98-104.09% for the 10 compounds analyzed. The validated method was successfully applied for the simultaneous determination of the 10 triterpenoid acids in 42 batches of Dazao which contained 36 cultivars from 22 cultivation regions, and were investigated and authenticated as Z. jujuba. Hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) and principal components analysis (PCA) were performed to differentiate and classify the samples based on the contents of the 10 triterpenoid acids. The presented HPLC-DAD method conjugated with chemometrics approach was demonstrated to be very helpful in using Dazao resources, and was possibly useful in chemotaxonomic characterization.	z. jujuba phosphoric acid
2	Mechanism of the anti-cancer activity of Zizyphus jujuba in HepG2 cells.The Zizyphus jujuba fruit has been used as a traditional Chinese medicinal herb and considered to affect various physiological functions in the body for thousands of years. However, its anti-cancer activity and mechanism of action remain to be elucidated. We investigated the anti-cancer activity of Zizyphus jujuba Mill and its underlining mechanisms of action in human hepatoma cells (HepG2) and found that the extract of Z. jujuba decreased the viability of the cells. Further extraction of the initial Z. jujuba extract with organic solvents revealed that the chloroform fraction (CHCl(3)-F) was the most effective. Interestingly, the CHCl(3)-F induced not only apoptosis but also G1 arrest at a low concentration (100 mug/ml) and G2/M arrest at a higher concentration (200 mug/ml) by cell cycle assay. Apoptosis, an increase in intracellular ROS (reactive oxygen species) level, a decline of mitochondrial membrane potential at low Z. jujuba concentrations, and a ROS-independent mitochondrial dysfunction pathway at high concentrations were all observed. CHCl(3)-F-induced G1 arrest in HepG2 cells was associated with an increase in hypohosphorylation of Rb and p27(Kip1), and a decrease of phosphorylated Rb. However, CHCl(3)-F-induced G2/M arrest in HepG2 cells correlated with a decrease of the p27(Kip1) levels and generation of the phosphorylation of p27(Kip1), however the hypohosphorylation of Rb protein remained. Collectively, our findings suggest that the CHCl(3)-F extract of Z. jujuba extract induced a concentration dependent effect on apoptosis and a differential cell cycle arrest in HepG2 cells.	z. jujuba cancer
1	Efficient quantification of the phenolic profiles of Zanthoxylum bungeanum leaves and correlation between chromatographic fingerprint and antioxidant activity.Sixteen subsequent fractions were prepared from the ethyl acetate fraction of Zanthoxylum bungeanum leaves after bio-guided chromatographic separation. The HPLC profiles and antioxidant activity of the various fractions indicated that the content of eight phenolic compounds (chlorogenic acid, epicatechin, rutin, hyperoside, trifolin, quercitrin, afzelin and quercetin) and antioxidant activity vary significantly, and high concentrations of a combination of eight phenolic compounds would result in an increase of the antioxidant activity. These results suggested that the eight compounds could be used as chemical markers for quality assessment of Z. bungeanum leaves. Correlation between chromatographic fingerprint and antioxidant activity of the fractions showed that quercitrin and hyperoside play crucial roles in the antioxidant activity, and they can be seen as the milestone for quality control. The findings also suggested that five obtained fractions (E-3-3, E-2-4, E-7, E-5 and E-4) could become useful supplements for functional food ingredients and health-related products. 	z. bungeanum quercitrin
4	Antiproliferative Activity of Cinnamomum cassia Constituents and Effects of Pifithrin-Alpha on Their Apoptotic Signaling Pathways in Hep G2 Cells.Cinnamaldehyde (Cin), cinnamic acid (Ca) and cinnamyl alcohol (Cal), major constituents of Cinnamomum cassia, have been shown to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer and other activities. In this study, our aim was to evaluate the antiproliferative activity of these compounds in human hepatoma Hep G2 cells and examine the effects of pifithrin-alpha (PFTalpha; a specific p53 inhibitor) on their apoptotic signaling transduction mechanism. The antiproliferative activity was measured by XTT assay. Expression of apoptosis-related proteins was detected by western blotting. Results showed that at a concentration of 30 muM, the order of antiproliferative activity in Hep G2 cells was Cin &gt; Ca &gt; Cal. Cin (IC(50) 9.76 +- 0.67 muM) demonstrated an antiproliferative potency as good as 5-fluorouracil (an anti-cancer drug; IC(50) 9.57 +- 0.61 muM). Further studies on apoptotic mechanisms of Cin showed that it downregulated the expression of Bcl-(XL), upregulated CD95 (APO-1), p53 and Bax proteins, as well as cleaving the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in a time-dependent pattern. PFTalpha pre-incubation significantly diminished the effect of Cin-induced apoptosis. It markedly upregulated the anti-apoptotic (Bcl-(XL)) expression and downregulated the pro-apoptotic (Bax) expression, as well as effectively blocking the CD95 (APO-1) and p53 expression, and PARP cleavage in Cin-treated cells. This study indicates that Cin was the most potent antiproliferative constituent of C. cassia, and its apoptotic mechanism in Hep G2 cells could be mediated through the p53 induction and CD95 (APO-1) signaling pathways.

1	Derivatives of the Lignan 7'-Hydroxymatairesinol with Antioxidant Properties and Enhanced Lipophilicity.The lignan 7'-hydroxymatairesinol (1), extracted from the knotwoods of fir (Abies alba), spruce (Picea abies), and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), exhibited unexpected reactivity when esterification reactions were attempted on the hydroxy group at position C-7'. To circumvent the rapid intramolecular cyclization procedure, leading quantitatively to the lignan conidendrin (7), a simple strategy for 7'-esterification of 1 under mild conditions (three steps, up to 80% overall yield) was developed. Compared to hydroxymatairesinol (1) (log K'w = 1.49), the derivatives (2-5) had increased lipophilicity with log K'w &gt; 3.1, as determined by a UHPLC method. Compounds 1-5 exhibited potent antioxidant properties in the same range as the standards ascorbic acid and alpha-tocopherol (IC50 = 20-25 muM) and higher than that of BHT using a DPPH radical-scavenging assay.	picea abies lignan 7'-hydroxymatairesinol
3	A new cytotoxic coumarin, 7-[(E)-3',7'-dimethyl-6'-oxo-2',7'-octadienyl] oxy coumarin, from the leaves of Zanthoxylum schinifolium.A new coumarin, 7-[(E)-3',7'-dimethyl-6'-oxo-2',7'-octadienyl]oxy coumarin (1), together with three known compounds, schinilenol (2), schinindiol (3) and 7-[(E)-7'-hydroxy-3',7'-dimethylocta-2',5'-dienyloxy]-coumarin (4) were isolated from the methylene chloride fraction of Z. schinifolium by normal and reverse phase column chromatographies. Their structures were determined on the basis of physical and spectroscopic evidences. Compound 1 (IC(50) 8.10 muM) showed potent cytotoxicity compared to auraptene (IC(50) 55.36 muM) against Jurkat T cells. The other isolated compounds 2 and 4 exhibited weak cytotoxicities.	7-[(e)-3',7'-dimethyl-6'-oxo-2',7'-octadienyl] oxy coumarin cytotoxicities
3	[Antidepressant activity of flavonoid ethanol extract of Abelmoschus manihot corolla with BDNF up-regulation in the hippocampus].Abelmoschus manihot (L.) Medic., a folk herbal medicine in China, is a flowering plant belongingto Abelmoschus L. genus and Malvaceae family, which has been reported with an antidepressant activity. Thestudy was designed to isolate flavonoids from Abelmoschus manihot corolla and explore the action mechanismof antidepressant activities. The flavonoids were isolated and purified by D101 macroporous resin column,polyamide column and Sephadex LH-20 sequentially and identified as myricetin-3-O-beta-D-glucoside (1),gossypetin-8-O-beta-D-glucuronide (2, G-8-G), gossypetin-3'-O-beta-D-glucoside (3), quercetin-3'-glucoside (4, Q-3-G),isoquercitrin (5, IQT), hyperoside (6, HY), myricetin (7), quercetin (8, QT). Compounds 2, 4, 5, 6 and 8(15, 30 and 60 mg kg-1) were orally administered to mice and the reaction was observed in tail suspensiontest (TST) and forced swimming test (FST). Western blot analysis was used in determination of the proteinexpressions of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB) and phosphorylationeukaryotic elongation factor 2 (p-eEF2). The results revealed that only Q-3-G and G-8-G (15, 30, 60 mg  kg-1)significantly reduced the immobility time in FST and TST. Furthermore, Q-3-G and G-8-G remarkably increasedthe expression of BDNF and TrkB, and decreased the expression of p-eEF2. These results suggest thatQ-3-G and G-8-G had an obvious antidepressant activity via up-regulation of BDNF expression. Thenew observation will provide a new direction in the development of antidepressant in the treatment of major depressivedisorder (MDD).	flavonoids major depressivedisorder
1	[Study on chemical constituents of the essential oil from Zanthoxylum Bungeanum Maxim by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry].The essential oil in Zanthoxylum Bungeanum Maxim was extracted by steam distillation and the distilled liquid was collected by passing through chloroform. The aqueous phase was extracted with chloroform sufficiently. The chloroform solution containing the constituents of essential oils was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry(GC-MS). Seventeen peaks were separated by gas chromatography, and 16 of them were identified by MS with "Nist98.L" Mass Spectral Data Registry. The structures of the constituents were further verified by manual analysis. The identified constituents accounted for 97% of the peak areas of the essential oils on total ion chromatogram. The major chemical constituents of them are C9, C10 alcohols and alkenes.	zanthoxylum bungeanum maxim essential oils
1	Quantitative and pattern recognition analyses of magnoflorine, spinosin, 6'''-feruloyl spinosin and jujuboside A by HPLC in Zizyphi Semen.Two rapid and simple HPLC methods with UV detector to determine three main compounds (magnoflorine, spinosin and 6'''-feruloyl spinosin) and evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD) to determine jujuboside A were developed for the chemical analyses of Zizyphi Semen. Magnoflorine, spinosin, and 6'''-feruloyl spinosin were separated with an YMC J'sphere ODS-H80 column (250 mm x 4.6 mm, 4 mum) by the gradient elution followed by the isocratic elution using methanol with 0.1 % formic acid and water with 0.1 % formic acid as the mobile phase. The flow rate was 1.0 mL/min. Jujuboside A was separated by HPLC-ELSD with YoungJinBioChrom Aegispak C18-L column (250 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 mum) column in a gradient elution using methanol with 0.1 % formic acid (A) and water with 0.1 % formic acid as the mobile phase. These two methods were fully validated with respect to linearity, precision, accuracy, stability, and robustness. These HPLC methods were applied successfully to quantify four compounds in a Zizyphi Semen extract. The HPLC analytical methods were validated for pattern recognition analysis by repeated analysis of 91 seed samples corresponding to 48 Zizyphus jujuba var. spinosa (J01-J48) and 43 Zizyphus mauritiana (M01-M43). The results indicate that these methods are suitable for a quality evaluation of Zizyphi Semen.	zizyphus jujuba var 6'''-feruloyl spinosin
1	FTIR and color change of the modified wood as a result of artificial light irradiation.The effect of UV-visible light irradiation on the changes in color and chemical composition of the surfaces of Abies alba L. (fir, a softwood), non-modified and chemically modified, was studied. Chemical modification of the wood was performed by reaction with succinic anhydride in xylene at different concentration values. The wood samples were irradiated in air using a rotative device equipped with a middle pressure mercury lamp. Analysis of the color changes in wood surfaces during photo-degradation was carried out by measuring CIELAB parameters. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to study chemical changes caused by light irradiation. Irradiation modified physical and chemical characteristics of wood surfaces and resulted in rapid color changes, degradation of lignin and increased content of chromophoric groups on the wood surfaces. Color changes (DeltaE(ab)) correlate well with degradation of lignin.	abies alba lignin
1	Total flavone of Abelmoschus manihot ameliorates Crohn's disease by regulating the NF-kappaB and MAPK signaling pathways.Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic relapsing form of inflammatory bowel disease, and its pathogenesis remains unknown. Total flavone of Abelmoschus manihot L. Medic (TFA), has been used as anti-inflammatory and myocardial ischemia protective drug. The present study aimed to explore the effects of TFA on CD and its underlying mechanism. We reported that TFA comprises eight flavone glycosides, including quercetin-3-O-robinobioside, gossypetin-3-O-glucoside, quercetin-3'-O-glucoside, isoquercetin, hyperoside, myricetin, gossypetin and quercetin. In vivo, TFA promoted the survival of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in mice, decreased weight loss and increased colon length in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, TFA notably ameliorated the inflammatory response in mice with TNBS-induced colitis as determined by histopathological analysis. In addition, the administration of TFA in mice with TNBS-induced colitis led to a significant decrease in the levels of cytokines in the sera and colon tissues; a significant decrease myeloperoxidase activity in the colon tissues was also observed. These findings may be associated with the suppression of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. In vitro, TFA significantly downregulated the expression of cytokines in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 cells. In addition, TFA suppressed LPS-induced activation of the NF-kappaB and MAPK signaling pathways in RAW264.7 cells. Our findings indicated that TFA could suppress the inflammatory response in mice with TNBS-induced colitis via inhibition of the NF-kappaB and MAPK signaling pathways. The results of the present study may improve understanding of the function of TFA and provide a novel theoretical basis for the treatment of CD.	abelmoschus manihot flavone
1	Phytochemical and biological activities of four wild medicinal plants.The fruits of four wild plants, namely, Capparis decidua, Ficus carica, Syzygium cumini, and Ziziphus jujuba, are separately used as traditional dietary and remedial agents in remote areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. The results of our study on these four plants revealed that the examined fruits were a valuable source of nutraceuticals and exhibited good level of antimicrobial activity. The fruits of these four investigated plants are promising source of polyphenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, and saponins. These four plants' fruits are good sources of iron, zinc, copper, manganese, selenium, and chromium. It was also observed that these fruits are potential source of antioxidant agent and the possible reason could be that these samples had good amount of phytochemicals. Hence, the proper propagation, conservation, and chemical investigation are recommended so that these fruits should be incorporated for the eradication of food and health related problems. 	capparis decidua polyphenols
3	Potential mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase R140Q mutant inhibitor from traditional Chinese medicine against cancers.A recent research of cancer has indicated that the mutant of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1 and 2) genes will induce various cancers, including chondrosarcoma, cholangiocarcinomas, and acute myelogenous leukemia due to the effect of point mutations in the active-site arginine residues of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), such as IDH1/R132, IDH2/R140, and IDH2/R172. As the inhibition for those tumor-associated mutant IDH proteins may induce differentiation of those cancer cells, these tumor-associated mutant IDH proteins can be treated as a drug target proteins for a differentiation therapy against cancers. In this study, we aim to identify the potent TCM compounds from the TCM Database@Taiwan as lead compounds of IDH2 R140Q mutant inhibitor. Comparing to the IDH2 R140Q mutant protein inhibitor, AGI-6780, the top two TCM compounds, precatorine and abrine, have higher binding affinities with target protein in docking simulation. After MD simulation, the top two TCM compounds remain as the same docking poses under dynamic conditions. In addition, precatorine is extracted from Abrus precatorius L., which represents the cytotoxic and proapoptotic effects for breast cancer and several tumor lines. Hence, we propose the TCM compounds, precatorine and abrine, as potential candidates as lead compounds for further study in drug development process with the IDH2 R140Q mutant protein against cancer. 	abrine cancer
1	Extracts of Canadian first nations medicinal plants, used as natural products, inhibit neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates with different antibiotic resistance profiles.BACKGROUND: Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Ng) has developed resistance to most antimicrobial agents and the antibiotics recommended for therapy are restricted, for the most part, to third generation cephalosporins. In order to investigate new potential sources of antimicrobial agents, the antibacterial properties of 14 Canadian plants used in traditional First Nations' medicine were tested against Ng isolates having differing antimicrobial susceptibility profiles. METHODS: Ethanolic extracts of 14 Canadian botanicals, analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography, were tested for their antimicrobial activity (disc diffusion and/or agar dilution assays) against susceptible Ng reference strains and a panel of 28 Ng isolates with various antimicrobial resistance profiles. RESULTS: Extracts of Arctostaphylos uva ursi (kinnikinnick or bearberry), Hydrastis canadensis (goldenseal), Prunus serotina (black cherry), and Rhodiola rosea (roseroot) inhibited the growth of all Ng isolates with minimum inhibitory concentrations of 32 mug/mL, 4 to 32 mug/mL, 16 to &gt;32 mug/mL, and 32 to 64 mug/mL, respectively. Extracts of Acorus americanus (sweet flag), Berberis vulgaris (barberry), Cimicifuga racemosa (black cohosh), Equisetum arvense (field horsetail), Gaultheria procumbens (wintergreen), Ledum groenlandicum (Labrador tea), Ledum palustre (marsh Labrador tea), Oenothera biennis (common evening primrose), Sambucus nigra (elderberry), and Zanthoxylum americanum (prickly ash) had weak or no antimicrobial activity against the Ng isolates with minimum inhibitory concentrations &gt;=256 mug/mL. The phytochemical berberine from H. canadensis inhibited the growth of all Ng isolates. The phytochemicals, salidroside and rosavin, present in R. rosea, also showed inhibitory activity against Ng strains. CONCLUSION: Canadian botanicals represent a potential source of novel compounds which inhibit Ng, including isolates resistant to antibiotics.	Ng salidroside
2	Cinnamon for diabetes mellitus.BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder that is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, sexual dysfunction and periodontal disease. Improvements in glycaemic control may help to reduce the risk of these complications. Several animal studies show that cinnamon may be effective in improving glycaemic control. While these effects have been explored in humans also, findings from these studies have not yet been systematically reviewed. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of cinnamon in patients with diabetes mellitus. SEARCH METHODS: Pertinent randomised controlled trials were identified through AARP Ageline, AMED, AMI, BioMed Central gateway, CAM on PubMed, CINAHL, Dissertations Abstracts International, EMBASE, Health Source Nursing/Academic edition, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, MEDLINE, Natural medicines comprehensive database, The Cochrane Library and TRIP database. Clinical trial registers and the reference lists of included trials were searched also (all up to January 2012). Content experts and manufacturers of cinnamon extracts were also contacted. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials comparing the effects of orally administered monopreparations of cinnamon (Cinnamomum spp.) to placebo, active medication or no treatment in persons with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias and trial quality, and extracted data. We contacted study authors for missing information. MAIN RESULTS: Ten prospective, parallel-group design, randomised controlled trials, involving a total of 577 participants with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, were identified. Risk of bias was high or unclear in all but two trials, which were assessed as having moderate risk of bias. Risk of bias in some domains was high in 50% of trials. Oral monopreparations of cinnamon (predominantly Cinnamomum cassia) were administered at a mean dose of 2 g daily, for a period ranging from 4 to 16 weeks. The effect of cinnamon on fasting blood glucose level was inconclusive. No statistically significant difference in glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), serum insulin or postprandial glucose was found between cinnamon and control groups. There were insufficient data to pool results for insulin sensitivity. No trials reported health-related quality of life, morbidity, mortality or costs. Adverse reactions to oral cinnamon were infrequent and generally mild in nature. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to support the use of cinnamon for type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus. Further trials, which address the issues of allocation concealment and blinding, are now required. The inclusion of other important endpoints, such as health-related quality of life, diabetes complications and costs, is also needed.	cinnamon type 2 diabetes mellitus
1	Field evaluation of repellency of a polyherbal essential oil against blackflies and its dermal toxicity using rat model.In the present study we have evaluated the repellent activity of mixture of Curcuma longa, Zanthoxylum limonella and Pogostemon heyneanus essential oils in 1:1:2 ratio at 5%, 10% and 20% concentration against blackflies in northeastern India. Initially the essential oil mixture tested here has been found effective against Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The average protection recorded in 20% concentration (170.56 +- 4.0; 95% CI = 162.09-179.02) was higher as compared to other two concentrations (F = 90.2; p&lt;0.0001; df = 53). Percentage repellency and repellency index was found to be higher in 20% concentration (p &lt;= 0.017). No appreciable clinical and behavioral signs were observed in the acute dermal toxicity using rat model. No changes were observed in biochemical profiles of treatment group animals. Similarly, no prominent lesions were observed in vital organs of treatment in both the sexes. The study concludes that tested repellent is safe for use and has multi-insects repellent property.	curcuma longa essential oil
2	Effects of selected plant essential oils on the growth and development of mouse preimplantation embryos in vivo.Plant essential oils (EOs) have been reported to have health benefit properties and their preventive and therapeutic use in animals is expected to increase in the future. We evaluated the influence of five essential oils obtained from plant species which are known to have positive antimicrobial, antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects--sage EO from Salvia officinalis L. (Lamiaceae), oregano EO from Origanum vulgare L. (Lamiaceae), thyme EO from Thymus vulgaris L. (Lamiaceae), clove EO from Syzygium aromaticum L. (Myrtaceae) and cinnamon EO from Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume (Lauraceae) on the growth and development of mouse preimplantation embryos in vivo. Essential oils were added to commercial diet at concentrations of 0.25% for sage EO, thyme EO, clove EO, cinnamon EO and 0.1% for oregano EO, and fed to ICR female mice for 2 weeks ad libitum. Females were then mated with males of the same strain. Embryos obtained on Day 4 of pregnancy at the blastocyst stage were stained by morphological triple staining (Hoechst, PI, Calcein-AM) and evaluated using fluorescent microscopy. The effects of essential oils were estimated by the viability of embryos, number of nuclei and distribution of embryos according to nucleus number. Cinnamon EO significantly decreased the number of nuclei and the distribution of embryos according to nucleus number was significantly altered. Sage EO negatively influenced the distribution of embryos according to nucleus number. Clove and oregano EOs induced a significantly increased rate of cell death. Only thyme EO had no detectable effects on embryo development. In conclusion, none of the essential oils had any positive effect on embryo development, but some of them reduced the number of cells and increased the incidence of cell death.	Clove death
1	Combined analysis by GC (RI), GC-MS and 13C NMR of the supercritical fluid extract of Abies alba twigs.Two samples (leaves and twigs) of Abies alba Miller from Corsica were extracted using supercritical CO2 and their chemical compositions were compared with those of the essential oils obtained from the same batch of plant material. In total 45 components were identified using combined analysis by GC (RI), GC-MS and 13C NMR. It was observed that the contents of monoterpenes (mainly represented by limonene, alpha-pinene and camphene) were significantly lower in the supercritical fluid extract (SFE) than in the essential oil (EO). Conversely, the proportions of sesquiterpenes were much higher in CO2 extracts than in essential oils (around 30% vs 4%). Cis-abienol, a diterpene alcohol, was identified only in SFE, and the proportions of this constituent (7.5% and 17.3%) were determined using quantitative 13C NMR since it was under estimated using the standard conditions of GC.	abies alba Cis-abienol
3	Plants traditionally prescribed to treat tazo (malaria) in the eastern region of Madagascar.BACKGROUND: Malaria is known as tazo or tazomoka in local terminology in Madagascar. Within the context of traditional practice, malaria (and/or malaria symptoms) is commonly treated by decoctions or infusions from bitter plants. One possible approach to the identification of new antimalarial drug candidates is to search for compounds that cure or prevent malaria in plants empirically used to treat malaria. Thus, it is worth documenting the ethnobotanical data, and testing the antiplasmodial activity of the extractive from plants. METHODS: We interviewed traditional healers, known locally as ombiasy, at Andasibe in the eastern, rainy part of Madagascar. We recorded details of the preparation and use of plants for medicinal purposes. We extracted five alkaloids from Z. tsihanimposa stem bark, and tested them in vitro against Plasmodium falciparum FCM29. RESULTS: We found that traditional healers treat malaria with herbal remedies consisting of one to eight different plants. We identified and listed the medicinal plants commonly used to treat malaria. The plants used included a large number of species from different families. Zanthoxylum sp (Rutaceae) was frequently cited, and plants from this genus are also used to treat malaria in other parts of Madagascar. From the plant list, Zanthoxylum tsihanimposa, bitter plant endemic to Madagascar, was selected and examined. Five alkaloids were isolates from the stem bark of this plant, and tested in vitro against malaria parasite. The geometric mean IC50 values ranged from 98.4 to 332.1 micromolar. The quinoline alkaloid gamma-fagarine exhibited the strongest antiplasmodial activity. CONCLUSIONS: The current use of plants for medicinal purposes reflects the attachment of the Malagasy people to their culture, and also a lack of access to modern medicine. The possible extrapolation of these in vitro findings, obtained with plant extracts, to the treatment of malaria and/or the signs evoking malaria is still unclear. If plants are to be used as sources of novel antimalarial compounds, we need to increase our knowledge of their empirical use to improve plant selection. In the hope of preserving useful resources, we should now gather and record ethnobotanical data in Madagascar, and should try to bridge the gaps between empirics and realism.	alkaloids malaria
1	Antioxidant and antiproliferative activities of Abrus precatorius leaf extracts--an in vitro study.BACKGROUND: The use of traditional medicine at the primary health care level is widespread and plant-based treatments are being recommended for curing various diseases by traditional medical practitioners all over the world. The phytochemicals present in the fruits, vegetables and medicinal plants are getting attention day-by-day for their active role in the prevention of several human diseases. Abrus precatorius is a widely distributed tropical medicinal plant with several therapeutic properties. Therefore in the present study, A. precatorius leaf extracts were examined for their antioxidant and cytotoxic properties in vitro in order to discover resources for new lead structures or to improve the traditional medicine. METHODS: In this study, antioxidant and antiproliferative properties of the different leaf extracts (hexane, ethyl acetate, ethanol and water) from A. precatorius were investigated along with the quantification of the polyphenol and flavonoid contents. The ability of deactivating free radicals was extensively investigated with in vitro biochemical methods like DPPH( ), ( )OH, NO, SO(2-) scavenging assays and inhibition capability of Fe(II)-induced lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, antiproliferative activities using different human cancer cell lines and primary cell line was carried out by MTT method. RESULTS: Total phenolic content and total flavonoid content of the extracts were found in the range of 1.65 +- 0.22 to 25.48 +- 0.62 GAE mg/g dw and 6.20 +- 0.41 to 17.16 +- 1.04 QE mg/g dw respectively. The experimental results further revealed that A. precatorius extracts showed strong antiradical properties, capable to chelate Fe(2+) and possess good inhibition ability of lipid peroxidation. In addition, as a first step towards the identification of phytoconstituents endowed with potent chemopreventive activities, we evaluated the inhibitory effects of A. precatorius extracts on the proliferation of four different human tumour cell lines such as human colon adenocarcinoma cells (Colo-205), human retinoblastoma cancer cells (Y79), human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2) and Leukemia cells (SupT1). Ethanol extract (APA) and ethyl acetate extract (APE) of A. precatorius had apparent capabilities of inhibiting the survival of tested human cancer cell lines. Moreover, it was observed that the A. precatorius extracts did not inhibit the growth of mice peritoneal macrophages, thus confirming that plants extracts are selective against the cancer cell lines. CONCLUSION: This work provides a scientific support for the high antioxidant and antiproliferative activity of this plant and thus it may find potential applications in the treatment of the diseases caused by ROS. Further studies are needed to confirm in vivo anti-tumorgenicity and subsequent chemical characterization of the active molecule(s).	a. precatorius polyphenol
2	Therapeutic efficacy of Zanthoxylum rhetsa DC extract against experimental Hymenolepis diminuta (Cestoda) infections in rats.Zanthoxylum rhetsa DC (Rutaceae), commonly called prickly ash, is used in the folk medicine of Naga tribes in India as a deworming remedy. In the present study, the therapeutic efficacy of Z. rhetsa leaf extract was investigated against experimental Hymenolepis diminuta (Cestoda) infections in albino rats. The efficacy of extract was determined on the basis of reduction in the eggs per gram of feces (EPG) counts and worm load following treatment with 100, 200, 400 and 800 mg/kg, p.o. doses of plant extract. For comparison's sake, animals were also treated with a reference drug, praziquantel at 5 and 25 mg/kg body weight doses. Three treatment regimes were followed to monitor the effects of extract on cestode parasite: (1) Treatment on day 2-4 postinoculation (pi) of cysticercoids against the larval stages; (2) treatment on day 8-10 pi against the immature stages; and (3) treatment on day 21-25 pi against the adult stages of parasite. The extract revealed its maximum efficacy against the larval stage, where its 800 mg/kg dose showed a worm count reduction of 86.60%, compared to 80.00% by the reference drug, praziquantel (5 mg/kg dose). The EPG counts also decreased drastically from 23,389 +- 2,372 to 0 in the same treatment group, compared to 33,161 +- 1,383 recorded in the control group. The efficacy of extract was found to be of moderate level against the immature and adult stages of parasite. The present investigation holds the evidence that the leaves of Z. rhetsa possess significant anticestodal property and supports its use in folk medicine.	zanthoxylum rhetsa hymenolepis diminuta (cestoda) infections
1	Feeding deterrents from Zanthoxylum schinifolium against two stored-product insects.Screening for insecticidal principles from several Chinese medicinal herbs showed that the fruit pericarp of Zanthoxylum schinifolium possessed significant feeding deterrence against two stored-product insects (Tribolium castaneum and Sitophilus zeamais). From the methanol extract, two feeding deterrents were isolated by bioassay-guided fractionation. The compounds were identified as schinifoline and skimmianine from their spectroscopic data. Schinifoline has feeding deterrent activity against T. castaneum and S. zeamais adults with EC(50) values of 47.8 and 85.6 ppm respectively. Skimmianine possess feeding deterrent activity against T. castaneum and S. zeamais adults with EC(50) values of 75.7 and 129.7 ppm respectively.	s. zeamais Skimmianine
2	In vivo antitrypanosomal effects of some ethnomedicinal plants from Nupeland of north central Nigeria.Four medicinal plants Acacia nilotica, Bombax buonopozense, Terminalia avicennioides and Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides traditionally used for treatment of sleeping sickness in Nupeland were investigated for in vivo antitrypanosomal activity. Methanol extracts of different parts of each plant (stem barks and fruits) were obtained and evaluated for their in vivo antitrypanosomal activities against Trypanosoma brucei brucei. Phytochemical screening of the methanol extracts of each plant were performed by standard procedures. Methanol extracts of A. nilotica (stem bark), B. buonopozense (stem bark), T. avicennioides (round fruit) and Z. zanthoxyloides (stem bark) were effective on trypanosomes. The extracts of A. nilotica and B. buonopozense exhibited antitrypanosomal effects at 200 and 300 mg/kg body weight respectively. Doses were able to clear the parasites from circulation within 6 and 7 days of treatment respectively with prolonging survival period of up to 30 days. While the extracts of T. avicennioides and Z. zanthoxyloides showed trypanostatic effects and could not clear the parasites completely. The methanol extracts of these plants contain metabolites that are associated with antitrypanosomal effects; therefore, these medicinal plants may be sources of new compounds that may be active against T. b. brucei. This study has also justified the claim that some medicinal plants of Nupeland possess antitrypanosomal activity and could be useful in the management of trypanosomiasis.	z. zanthoxyloides trypanosomiasis
3	Silver fir (Abies alba) trunk extract protects guinea pig arteries from impaired functional responses and morphology due to an atherogenic diet.BACKGROUND: Diet, rich in plant polyphenols prevents atherogenesis that manifests as reduced vascular relaxation and formation of plaques. HYPOTHESIS: Atherosclerosis could be reduced by the intake of silver fir (Abies alba) extract (SFTE), rich in polyphenols. STUDY DESIGN: Chronic, in vivo treatment animal study. METHODS: Guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) were fed for 8 weeks with one of the following three diets: atherogenic, basic or atherogenic + SFTE. After isolation, we measured the relaxation and contractile responses of the thoracic aorta. Additionally, we measured the area of fatty plaques on the aortic walls. RESULTS: Compared to the basic diet, the atherogenic diet decreased the ability of the aorta to relax by 63% (p &lt; 0.001). The addition of SFTE to the atherogenic diet improved the aorta relaxation response compared to that of the atherogenic diet without SFTE (the decrease relative to the basic diet was 26%, p &lt; 0.001). The aorta contractility did not differ between the groups. The SFTE group generated significantly fewer atherosclerotic plaques than did the atherogenic group. The areas of atherosclerotic plaques were 7.4, 0.3 and 1.6% in the aortas of guinea pigs receiving atherogenic, basic or atherogenic + SFTE diets, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In a guinea pig model, prolonged treatment with antioxidative polyphenol-rich SFTE prevents aortic functional and morphological changes caused by an atherogenic diet.	polyphenol atherosclerotic
1	Methylxanthines reversibly inhibit tracheary-element differentiation in suspension cultures of Zinnia elegans L.Tracheary-element (TE) differentiation in suspension-cultured mesophyll cells of Zinnia elegans L. was completely inhibited by caffeine and theophylline only when these methylxanthines were applied at least 8 h prior to the appearance of secondary cell-wall thickenings. In contrast, the calcium-channel blocker nifedipine completely inhibited TE differentiation when applied only 2-3 h prior to the onset of secondary cell-wall deposition. This indicates the involvement of a methylxanthine-inhibitable event in TE differentiation that is distinguishable from an event dependent on influx of extracellular calcium. The correlation between the time of appearance of chlorotetracycline fluorescence (an indicator of sequestered Ca(2+)) and loss of methylxanthine effectiveness indicates that inhibition by methylxanthines may result from release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores. Methylxanthines with high potencies against adenosine 3' : 5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) phosphodiesterase and adenosine receptors were less effective inhibitors of TE differentiation, indicating that inhibition of differentiation by methylxanthines is independent of cAMP metabolism. The role of cAMP in transduction of the cytokinin signal, which was proposed previously on the basis of stimulation of TE differentiation by theophylline, was investigated using the non-hydrolyzable analog 8-bromo-cAMP. Although 8-bromo-cAMP stimulated differentiation in the absence of inductive concentrations of cytokinin, the non-cyclic analog 8-bromo-AMP was even more effective, indicating that 8-bromo-cAMP behaves as a cytokinin analog, rather than a second messenger, in stimulating TE differentiation. 	zinnia elegans theophylline
1	Diverse mechanisms of antidiabetic effects of the different procyanidin oligomer types of two different cinnamon species on db/db mice.The procyanidin oligomers are thought to be responsible for the antidiabetic activity of cinnamon. To investigate the hypoglycemic effects of different procyanidin oligomer types, the procyanidin oligomer-rich extracts were prepared from two different cinnamon species. Using high-performance liquid chromatography with purified procyanidin oligomers as reference compounds, we found that the  Cinnamomum cassia  extract (CC-E) and  Cinnamomum tamala  extract (CT-E) were rich in B- and A-type procyanidin oligomers, respectively. In the experiment, 8-week-old diabetic (db/db) mice were gavaged with CC-E and CT-E (both 200 mg/kg per day) for 4 weeks. Both CC-E and CT-E exhibited antidiabetic effects. Moreover, histopathological studies of the pancreas, liver, and adipose tissue showed that CC-E promoted lipid accumulation in the adipose tissue and liver, whereas CT-E mainly improved the insulin concentration in the blood and pancreas.	cinnamon procyanidin
1	Pharmacognostical and phytochemical evaluation of the leaves of Ziziphus xylopyrus (Retz) Willd.BACKGROUND: The fruit decoction of Ziziphus xylopyrus (Retz) Willd. is used toward increase sterility in woman intended birth control in some parts of Rajasthan, India. This plant is widely used in Turkish medicines as a potent sedative. One to two inches of the fresh stem bark of this species are chewed with 1-2 peppers, and the sap swallowed once a day for 5 days in the treatment of cough. Standardization is one of the challenges in herbal medicine. It is essential to evaluate the herbal plants scientifically and proper documentation should be made to know their medicinal properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Leaf samples of Z. xylopyrus were studied as recommended by World Health Organization for morphological, microscopic, physicochemical, phytochemical, powder characteristics and other methods for standardization. RESULTS: Morphologically the leaves are obovate or orbicular in shape, pinnate venation having aromatic odour and pungent taste. Microscopically leaves showed the presence of ground tissue, vascular strand, xylem and phloem. The crystals are mostly rosette type. Microscopic examination of powder showed the presence of stomata, covering trichomes, sclerenchyma, collenchyma, epidermal cells and vascular strands. Phytochemical screening of the plant part with various solvents revealed the presence of alkaloids, carbohydrates, steroids and sterol, glycosides, saponins, flavonoids, phenolic compounds, triterpenoids in it. Physicochemical parameters such as ash value extractive values were also determined and results showed that water soluble extractive value to be higher than alcohol soluble extractive value. CONCLUSION: Results may be helpful for further confirmation of selected species and in future these characters may be compared with the new batch of the same plant materials.	ziziphus xylopyrus carbohydrates
1	Miscellaneous terpenoid constituents of Abies nephrolepis and their moderate cytotoxic activities.Three monoterpenoids and two triterpenoids were isolated from Abies nephrolepis together with 53 known terpenoids. The structures of the compounds were established by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. The absolute configuration of 3-hydroxycamphane-2-carboxylic acid was established as (1S,2R,3S,4R) by Cu-Kalpha X-ray crystallography. All 58 isolates were tested for cytotoxic activity against four tumor cells viz. A549 (human lung adenocarcinoma), Colo205 (colon adenocarcinoma), QGY-7703 (human hepatoma) and THP-1 (human monocytic leukemia). alpha-Cadinol exhibited the best effects on A549, Colo205 and QGY-7703 with IC(50) values of 8.6, 8.1 and 4.6 mug/mL, respectively.	abies nephrolepis terpenoids
1	Enhanced repellency of binary mixtures of Zanthoxylum piperitum pericarp steam distillate or Zanthoxylum armatum seed oil constituents and Calophyllum inophyllum nut oil and their aerosols to Stomoxys calcitrans.BACKGROUND: The repellency to stable fly, Stomoxys calcitrans (L.), of Zanthoxylum piperitum (L.) DC pericarp steam distillate (ZP-SD), Zanthoxylum armatum DC seed oil (ZA-SO) and their constituents alone or in combination with Calophyllum inophyllum L. nut oil (CI-NO), as well as six aerosol formulations containing ZP-SD or ZP-SO and CI-NO, was compared with that of a synthetic repellent, DEET, using an exposed human hand bioassay. RESULTS: At 0.20 mg cm(-2), ZP-SD treatments resulted in 91 and 68% repellency following 30 and 60 min exposure respectively, while DEET gave 100 and 84% repellency. ZA-SO was less effective than ZP-SD. At 0.2 mg cm(-2), the most active constituents, cuminaldehyde, cuminyl alcohol, limonene and methyl cinnamate, gave 82, 74, 74 and 64% repellency at 30 min respectively, but DEET gave 100 and 87% repellency at 30 and 60 min. An increase in effectiveness and duration of repellency was produced by binary mixtures of ZP-SD, ZA-SO or bioactive constituents (each 0.01 mg cm(-2)) and CI-NO (0.99 mg cm(-2)). The repellency of aerosols containing 2.5% ZP-SD or 2.5% ZA-SO and 2.5% CI-NO was comparable with that of 5% DEET aerosol. CONCLUSION: Mixtures formulated from ZP-SD, ZA-SO or bioactive constituents and CI-NO could be useful as potential repellents for the control of stable fly populations in light of global efforts to reduce the level of highly toxic synthetic repellents.	zanthoxylum piperitum (l.) dc limonene
1	In vitro activities of plant extracts on human Loa loa isolates and cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells.Loa loa, a filarial worm, can cause fatal encephalitis in humans. In an attempt to find alternatives to the standard treatments (ivermectin and diethylcarbamazine citrate), we tested 12 methanolic extracts of nine traditional plant remedies. The extracts (100-0.09 microg/ml) were incubated with 20 Loa loa microfilariae isolated from patients at 37 degrees C with 5% CO(2) in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal serum and antibiotics. Activity was evaluated 120 h later by counting live microfilariae under a microscope. Cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells was estimated by measuring 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2-5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide transformation to formazan at 450 nM in a spectrophotometer. The plants tested were Lophira alata, Greenwayodendron suaveolens, Uapaca togoensis, Zanthoxylum heitzii, Peperomia pellucida, Piptadeniastrum africanum, Petersianthus macrocarpus, Vernonia conferta, and Vernonia hymenolepis. Chemical screening showed that most of the extracts contained reducing sugars, tannin or polyphenols, sterols or triterpenes, saponosides, and alkaloids. None contained carotinoids and few contained flavonoids. The 50% lethal concentration ranged from 0.22 to 70.28 microg/ml, while the 50% inhibitory concentration for eukaryotic cells (IC(50)) ranged from 8.52 to 119.52 microg/ml. Extracts of P. macrocarpus (selectivity index = 72.16), P. africanum (13.69), Z. heitzii (12.11), and L. alata (9.26) were highly selective for L. loa.	p. macrocarpus carotinoids
1	SPE-HPLC method for the determination of four flavonols in rat plasma and urine after oral administration of Abelmoschus manihot extract.A SPE-HPLC method was developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of flavonols, isoquercitrin (1), hibifolin (2), myricetin (3), quercetin-3'-O-d-glucoside (4) and quercetin (5) in rat plasma and urine after oral administration of the total flavonoids from Abelmoschus manihot (TFA). The astragalin (6) and kaempferol (7) were used as internal standards (IS). Plasma and urine samples were pretreated by solid-phase extraction using Winchem C(18) reversed-phase cartridges. Analysis of the plasma and urinary extract was performed on YMC-Pack ODS-A C(18) and Thermo ODS-2HYEPRSIL C(18) reversed-phase column, respectively and a mobile phase of acetonitrile-0.1% phosphoric acid was employed. HPLC analysis was conducted with different elution gradients. The flow rate was 1.0 mL/min and the detection wavelength was set at 370 nm. Calibration ranges in plasma for flavonols 2-5 were at 0.011-2.220, 0.014-2.856, 0.022-4.320, and 0.028-5.600 microg/mL, respectively. In urine calibration ranges for flavonols 1, 2, 4 and 5 were at 2.00-16.00, 8.56-102.72, 2.70-21.60, and 3.00-24.00 microg/mL, respectively. The RSD of intra- and inter-day was less than 5.40% and 4.89% in plasma, and less than 3.96% and 6.85% in urine for all the analyses. A preliminary experiment to investigate the plasma concentration and urinary excretion of the flavonols after oral administration of TFA to rats demonstrated that the present method was suitable for determining the flavonols in rat plasma and urine.	abelmoschus manihot hibifolin
3	2-Methoxycinnamaldehyde inhibits the TNF-alpha-induced proliferation and migration of human aortic smooth muscle cells.The abnormal proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is a crucial event in the development of atherosclerosis, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is actively involved in this process by enhancing the proliferation and migration of VSMCs. 2-Methoxycinnamaldehyde (MCA) is a natural compound of Cinnamomum cassia. Although 2-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (HCA), another compound from Cinnamomum cassia, has been widely studied with regard to its antitumor activity, MCA has not attracted researchers' interest due to its mild toxic effects on cancer cells and its mechanisms of action remain unknown. In this study, we examined the effects of MCA on the TNF-alpha-induced proliferation and migration of human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). As shown by our results, MCA inhibited TNF-alpha-induced cell proliferation by reducing the levels of cyclin D1, cyclin D3, CDK4 and CDK6, and increasing the levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p21 and p27, without resulting in cellular cytotoxicity. Furthermore, MCA decreased the level of secreted matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 by inhibiting MMP-9 transcription. Unexpectedly, MCA did not affect the TNF-alpha-induced levels of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). However, by showing that MCA potently inhibited the degradation of IkappaBalpha and the subsequent nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), we demonstrated that MCA exerts its effects through the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. MCA also effectively inhibited platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced HASMC migration. Taken together, these observations suggest that MCA has the potential for use as an anti-atherosclerotic agent.	MCA atherosclerotic
1	Phytochemical and biological activities of four wild medicinal plants.The fruits of four wild plants, namely, Capparis decidua, Ficus carica, Syzygium cumini, and Ziziphus jujuba, are separately used as traditional dietary and remedial agents in remote areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. The results of our study on these four plants revealed that the examined fruits were a valuable source of nutraceuticals and exhibited good level of antimicrobial activity. The fruits of these four investigated plants are promising source of polyphenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, and saponins. These four plants' fruits are good sources of iron, zinc, copper, manganese, selenium, and chromium. It was also observed that these fruits are potential source of antioxidant agent and the possible reason could be that these samples had good amount of phytochemicals. Hence, the proper propagation, conservation, and chemical investigation are recommended so that these fruits should be incorporated for the eradication of food and health related problems. 	ziziphus jujuba saponins
1	Jubanines F-J, cyclopeptide alkaloids from the roots of Ziziphus jujuba.Five Ib-type cyclopeptide alkaloids, jubanines F-J (1-5), and three known compounds, nummularine B (6), daechuine-S3 (7), and mucronine K (8) were isolated from the roots of Ziziphus jujuba. Their structures were fully characterized by spectroscopic analyses in combination with chemical derivatization. Compounds 1-3, and 6 were evaluated for their antiviral activity against the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). Compounds 2, 3, and 6 showed potent inhibitory effects on PEDV replication. 	ziziphus jujuba mucronine k
1	Dietary Ziziphus jujuba Fruit Influence on Aberrant Crypt Formation and Blood Cells in Colitis-Associated Colorectal Cancer in Mice.Ziziphus jujuba (ZJ) fruit is rich in bioactive functional components such as polysaccharides, triterpenoid acid, flavonoids and oleamide. It has been commonly used in the treatment of various diseases including diabetes, digestive disorders, diarrhea, skin infections, liver and urinary complaints. However, dietary effects with regard to chemoprevention of colon cancer have not been studied. The present study was performed to evaluate the protective effects of dietary ZJ against colitis-associated colon carcinogenesis in azoxymethane (AOM)-dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)-treated mice. AOM was injected (10 mg/kg b.wt., i.p.) and three cycles of 2% DSS in drinking water for 7 days with 14 days of normal drinking water in-between were administered to induce colitis-associated colon cancer. ZJ fruit was supplemented into feed at levels of 5 and 10%. Dietary ZJ significantly attenuated aberrant crypt foci (ACF) formation and also decreased the progression of hyperplasia to dysplasia. In addition, it significantly reduced circulating white blood cells, lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils and platelets compared to colon cancer mice. We conclude that ZJ supplementation may delay the progression of colon cancer from hyperplasia to dysplasia and ultimately adenocarcinoma and cancer. In addition, it decreased circulating tumor-related leukocytes, main regulators of cancer inflammation. Dietary consumption of ZJ fruit attenuated the formation of ACF and delayed the progression of colon cancer. 	ziziphus jujuba polysaccharides
2	Anthelmintic screening of Zimbabwean plants traditionally used against schistosomiasis.Extracts of 23 plant species used popularly against schistosomiasis in Zimbabwe were screened for their anthelmintic effect. Schistosomules of the trematode Schistosoma mansoni and cysticercoids of the cestode Hymenolepis diminuta were studied in vitro. The material consisted of 58 plant extracts, of which 37 killed the newly excysted cysticercoids within an hour, when incubated in a culture medium. Lethal concentrations varied from 0.8 to 103 mg/ml. All plant extracts showed activity against the tapeworms after 24 h. Ten of the best extracts were also tested against schistosomules. Five of these extracts showed activity. Lethal concentrations varied from 0.6 to 33.8 mg/ml of dry plant material. Extracts of stem and root from Abrus precatorius (Fabaceae), of root bark and leaves from Ozoroa insignis (Anacardiaceae) and of root bark from Zizyphus mucronata (Rhamnaceae) gave the best results against tapeworms. The best results against schistosomules were obtained with stem and root extracts from Abrus precatorius (Fabaceae) and stem bark from Elephantorrhiza goetzei (Mimosaceae). Although the activity of root and root bark extracts commonly used in traditional medicine was verified in this study, our results showed that also extracts from leaf and stem can be effective anthelmintics.	hymenolepis diminuta schistosomiasis
1	Inhibition of fungal spore adhesion by zosteric Acid as the basis for a novel, nontoxic crop protection technology.ABSTRACT To explore the potential for nontoxic crop protection technologies based on the inhibition of fungal spore adhesion, we have tested the effect of synthetic zosteric acid (p-(sulfo-oxy) cinnamic acid), a naturally occurring phenolic acid in eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) plants, on spore adhesion and infection in two pathosystems: rice blast caused by Magnaporthe grisea and bean anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum lindemuthianum. We have shown that zosteric acid inhibits spore adhesion to model and host leaf surfaces and that any attached spores fail to develop appressoria, and consequently do not infect leaf cells. Low concentrations of zosteric acid that are effective in inhibiting adhesion are not toxic to either fungus or to the host. The inhibition of spore adhesion in the rice blast pathogen is fully reversible. On plants, zosteric acid reduced (rice) or delayed (bean) lesion development. These results suggest that there is potential for novel and environmentally benign crop protection technologies based on manipulating adhesion.	zostera marina l zosteric acid
2	Evaluation of thermal-oxidative stability and antiglioma activity of Zanthoxylum tingoassuiba essential oil entrapped into multi- and unilamellar liposomes.Zanthoxylum tinguassuiba essential oil (ZtEO) contains alpha-bisabolol, a known antiglioma sesquiterpene, among other potentially active substances. Medical applications of this essential oil require advances in the design of distinctive carriers due to its low water solubility and easy degradation by heat, light, and oxygen. The aim of this work was to evaluate enhancement in oxidative stability and the ability to reduce glioblastoma cell viability of ZtEO loaded into liposomes. Multi- and unilamellar vesicles were prepared to carry ZtEO. By using thermal analysis, it was observed that thermal-oxidative stability of the liposomal ZtEO was enhanced, when compared to its free form. Liposomal ZtEO also presented significant apoptotic-inducing activity for glioma cells. These results show that liposomal systems carrying ZtEO may be a potential alternative for gliobastoma treatment.	Zanthoxylum glioblastoma
