The drug increased the survival of the experimental mice infected with TBE virus and prolonged their lifespan. It was shown that 7,3'-disulfate luteolin reduced the virus accumulation in the SPEV cells by 2.0-4.0 lg TChemicalActOnDisease50/ml.	zostera marina 7,3'-disulfate luteolin
1	Anthocyanins acylated with gallic acid from chenille plant, Acalypha hispida.Three anthocyanins were isolated from the red flowers of chenille plant, Acalypha hispida Burm. (Euphorbiaceae) by a combination of chromatographic techniques. Their structures were elucidated mainly by homo- and heteronuclear nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and electrospray mass spectrometry, and supported with complete assignments of 13C NMR resonances. The novel pigment, cyanidin 3-O-(2"-galloyl-6"-O-alpha-rhamnopyranosyl-beta-galactopyranoside) (5%), contains the disaccharide robinoside. The other anthocyanins were identified as cyanidin 3-O-(2"-galloyl-beta-galactopyranoside) (85%), and cyanidin 3-O-beta-galactopyranoside (5%). Anthocyanins acylated with gallic acid have previously been identified in species from the families Nymphaeaceae and Aceraceae, and tentatively in Abrus precatorius (Leguminosae).	abrus precatorius gallic acid
3	Anti-inflammatory activity of seed essential oil from Zizyphus jujuba.This study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of essential oil from seeds of Zizyphus jujuba on TPA-induced skin inflammation in experimental mice. Exposure of TPA on the ear of the BALB/c mice caused a marked increase in both ear thickness and skin water content. The ear thickness was measured for TPA-induced ear was 0.54 mm, as compared to control (0.23 mm). Treatment with 1% and 10% of essential oil caused significant decrease in ear thicknesses which were measured to be 0.30 and 0.35 mm, as well as reduce the water content about 51% and 53% in the TPA-induced skin inflammation model, respectively. Furthermore, histological analysis clearly confirmed that Z. jujuba essential oil inhibited the inflammatory responses of skin inflammation in animal model. Therefore, our findings demonstrate that the essential oil of Z. jujuba seeds might accelerate the development of new drugs for various inflammatory diseases.	essential oil skin inflammation
4	Nrf2-dependent suppression of azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium-induced colon carcinogenesis by the cinnamon-derived dietary factor cinnamaldehyde.The progressive nature of colorectal cancer and poor prognosis associated with the metastatic phase of the disease create an urgent need for the development of more efficacious strategies targeting colorectal carcinogenesis. Cumulative evidence suggests that the redox-sensitive transcription factor Nrf2 (nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2), a master regulator of the cellular antioxidant defence, represents a promising molecular target for colorectal cancer chemoprevention. Recently, we have identified cinnamon, the ground bark of Cinnamomum aromaticum (cassia cinnamon) and Cinnamomum verum (Ceylon cinnamon), as a rich dietary source of the Nrf2 inducer cinnamaldehyde (CA) eliciting the Nrf2-regulated antioxidant response in human epithelial colon cells, conferring cytoprotection against electrophilic and genotoxic insult. Here, we have explored the molecular mechanism underlying CA-induced Nrf2 activation in colorectal epithelial cells and have examined the chemopreventive potential of CA in a murine colorectal cancer model comparing Nrf2(+/+) with Nrf2(-/-) mice. In HCT116 cells, CA caused a Keap1-C151-dependent increase in Nrf2 protein half-life via blockage of ubiquitination with upregulation of cytoprotective Nrf2 target genes and elevation of cellular glutathione. After optimizing colorectal Nrf2 activation and target gene expression by dietary CA-supplementation regimens, we demonstrated that CA suppresses AOM/DSS-induced inflammatory colon carcinogenesis with modulation of molecular markers of colorectal carcinogenesis. Dietary suppression of colorectal cancer using CA supplementation was achieved in Nrf2(+/+) but not in Nrf2(-/-) mice confirming the Nrf2 dependence of CA-induced chemopreventive effects. Taken together, our data suggest feasibility of colorectal cancer suppression by dietary CA, an FDA-approved food additive derived from the third most consumed spice in the world.

1	Antibacterial and Antibiofilm Activities of Cinnamomum Sp. Essential Oil and Cinnamaldehyde: Antimicrobial Activities.To assess the activities of essential oils derived from the trunk bark of Cinnamomum zeylanicum (EOCz) and Cinnamomum cassia (EOCc) as well as cinnamaldehyde on bacterial biofilms of clinical interest. Antimicrobial activity was assessed by the broth microdilution method to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Antibiofilm activity was assessed by quantifying the biomass and determining the number of viable cells. The chemical composition of the essential oils was determined. The results showed that the major component of EOCz and EOCc was cinnamaldehyde. For the assayed substances, biofilm biomasses were reduced by up to 99.9%, and Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli biofilms were sensitive to all of the concentrations and substances analysed. In cell viability tests, 2 mg/ml of cinnamaldehyde reduced the number of viable cells by 5.74 Log CFU/ml. EOCz, EOCc, and cinnamaldehyde exhibited antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities. This work describes substances with potential use against infections caused by bacterial biofilms.	cinnamomum zeylanicum cinnamaldehyde
2	Evaluation of thermal-oxidative stability and antiglioma activity of Zanthoxylum tingoassuiba essential oil entrapped into multi- and unilamellar liposomes.Zanthoxylum tinguassuiba essential oil (ZtEO) contains alpha-bisabolol, a known antiglioma sesquiterpene, among other potentially active substances. Medical applications of this essential oil require advances in the design of distinctive carriers due to its low water solubility and easy degradation by heat, light, and oxygen. The aim of this work was to evaluate enhancement in oxidative stability and the ability to reduce glioblastoma cell viability of ZtEO loaded into liposomes. Multi- and unilamellar vesicles were prepared to carry ZtEO. By using thermal analysis, it was observed that thermal-oxidative stability of the liposomal ZtEO was enhanced, when compared to its free form. Liposomal ZtEO also presented significant apoptotic-inducing activity for glioma cells. These results show that liposomal systems carrying ZtEO may be a potential alternative for gliobastoma treatment.	Zanthoxylum glioma
1	Nitidine chloride suppresses epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in osteosarcoma cell migration and invasion through Akt/GSK-3beta/Snail signaling pathway.Metastasis is the main cause of death in osteosarcoma. Targeting the process of metastasis is a main strategy for osteosarcoma therapy. As a traditional Chinese medicine, Zanthoxylum nitidum (Roxb) has been applied to treat various diseases, including cancer. However, no evidence has been shown on the anti-metastasis effect of nitidine chloride (NC) that was extracted from Zanthoxylum nitidum (Roxb) on osteosarcoma cells, or its underling mechanisms. In the present study, we aimed to demonstrate the role of NC on the migration and invasion of osteosarcoma cells. Viability and proliferation of osteosarcoma cells were examined by MTT assay. Then, by appling scratch wound healing assay and Transwell assays, we evaluated migratory and invasive ability of the cells, respectively. Moreover, the expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers were determined after treatment with NC. Furthermore, the expression of Akt, GSK-3beta and Snail were detected by western blot analysis. In addition, the GSK-3beta activity was examined by GSK-3beta kinase assay. Finally, an inhibitor of GSK-3beta, lithium chloride (LiCl) was applied to testify the effect of NC on the expression of EMT markers and Snail. We found that the proliferative, migratory and invasive ability of the U2OS osteosarcoma cells were all suppressed when treated with NC. NC increased the expression of E-cadherin and decreased the expression of N-cadherin, vimentin and fibronectin in a dose-dependent manner. NC also exerted its ability to suppress the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3beta so as to activate GSK-3beta. Then, by using an GSK-3beta inhibitor, LiCl, we revealed the effect of GSK-3beta in the expression of EMT markers. The expression of Snail was inhibited when treated with NC and LiCl also reversed the NC-inhibited Snail expression. Taken together, these results revealed that NC suppressed EMT and decreased the invasive ability of osteosarcoma cells via the Akt/GSK-3beta/snail signaling pathway. 	zanthoxylum nitidum NC
4	Hydroxy-alpha-sanshool activates TRPV1 and TRPA1 in sensory neurons.Sanshools are major active ingredients of Zanthoxylum piperitum and are used as food additives in East Asia. Sanshools cause irritant, tingling and sometimes paresthetic sensations on the tongue. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the pungent or tingling sensation induced by sanshools is not known. Because many transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are responsible for the sensations induced by various spices and food additives, we expressed 17 TRP channels in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells and investigated their activation by hydroxy-alpha-sanshool (HalphaSS) or hydroxy-beta-sanshool (HbetaSS) isolated from Zanthoxylum piperitum. It was found that HalphaSS, but not HbetaSS, depolarized sensory neurons with concomitant firing of action potentials and evoked inward currents. Among 17 TRP channels expressed in HEK cells, HalphaSS caused Ca(2+) influx in cells transfected with TRPV1 or TRPA1, and evoked robust inward currents in cells transfected with TRPV1 or TRPA1. In primary cultured sensory neurons, HalphaSS induced inward currents and Ca(2+) influx in a capsazepine-dependent manner. Moreover, HalphaSS-induced currents and Ca(2+) influx were greatly diminished in TRPV1(-/-) mice. HalphaSS evoked licking behavior when injected into a single hind paw of wild-type mice, but this was much reduced in TRPV1-deficient mice. These results indicate that TRPV1 and TRPA1 are molecular targets of HalphaSS in sensory neurons. We conclude that the activations of TRPV1 and TRPA1 by HalphaSS explain its unique pungent, tingling sensation.	TRPA1 sensations
1	Relative bioavailability of coumarin from cinnamon and cinnamon-containing foods compared to isolated coumarin: a four-way crossover study in human volunteers.SCOPE: Cassia cinnamon contains high levels (up to 1 %) of coumarin. Heavy consumption of this spice may result in a dose exceeding the tolerable daily intake (TDI). In this context, the question was raised whether coumarin in the plant matrix of cinnamon has the same bioavailability as isolated coumarin. METHODS AND RESULTS: A four-way crossover study was performed, in which the same dose of 12 mg coumarin was administered in different formulations to 24 healthy volunteers. The relative extent of absorption measured as urinary excretion of the main metabolite 7-hydroxycoumarin (7OHC) was found to be 62.8% for isolated coumarin in a capsule (reference), 56.0% for cinnamon in capsules, 66.1% for cinnamon tea, and 54.7% for cinnamon in rice pudding (means, n=23, observation period 8 hours). Additionally, 7OHC plasma levels were measured for 105 minutes after administration and revealed a fast absorption of coumarin from cinnamon tea leading to the highest peak concentrations. CONCLUSION: The relative extent of absorption of coumarin from powder of cassia cinnamon is only slightly lower than that of isolated coumarin. Therefore, the TDI of coumarin can be used for risk assessment of coumarin exposure from cinnamon-containing meals.	cinnamon coumarin
2	Attempted suicide, by mail order: Abrus precatorius.OBJECTIVE: Abrus precatorius is cultivated in many subtropical areas. The seeds exist in a variety of colors such as black, orange, and most commonly, glossy red. A black band is found at the end of the seed. The plant contains multiple pods which typically contain three to five Abrus seeds. The seeds contain abrin, which inhibits ribosomal function, halting protein synthesis and leading to cellular death. A unique aspect of this case is the use of the internet to order a potentially lethal poison as well as transmission of a picture to identify the seed. CASE REPORT: A 20-year-old man presented to the emergency department complaining of vomiting and watery diarrhea for 6-8 h prior to arrival. He denied any medication use, recent illness, travel, or changes in his diet. Initial vital signs were normal. The patient was diagnosed with viral gastroenteritis. During his evaluation, the patient admitted to feeling suicidal. While awaiting psychiatry evaluation, the patient's father arrived with a box of small hard red seeds, which he believed that his son ingested in a suicide attempt. The seeds could not be identified by the staff. A picture of the seeds was transmitted by e-mail to the New York City Poison Control Center, allowing their identification as A. precatorius. The patient was reinterviewed and admitted to chewing and swallowing 10 seeds. Given the potential toxicity of abrin, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. He continued to have frequent episodes of emesis as well as diarrhea. He gradually improved over 2 days. He admitted to ordering a box of Abrus seeds online from Asia after reading on the Internet about their use in suicide. He was eventually discharged for outpatient follow-up with no permanent sequelae. CONCLUSION: Abrin has an estimated human fatal dose of 0.1-1 mug/kg. Most cases of Abrus seed ingestions are unintentional and occur in children. Ingesting the intact seeds typically results in no clinical findings, as they pass through the gastrointestinal tract due to their hard shell. Abrin released during chewing is poorly absorbed systemically from the gastrointestinal tract. This causes the vomiting and diarrhea with resultant hypovolemia and electrolyte disturbances, which can be severe and life threatening, particularly in areas with less advanced health care systems. Management is primarily supportive.	a. precatorius vomiting
2	Cinnamon and Chronic Diseases.Cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum and Cinnamon cassia), the eternal tree of tropical medicine, belongs to the Lauraceae family and is one of the most important spices used daily by people all over the world. It contains a lot of manganese, iron, dietary fiber, and calcium. Cinnamon contains derivatives, such as cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid, cinnamate, and numerous other components such as polyphenols and antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, anticancer effects. Several reports have dealt with the numerous properties of cinnamon in the forms of bark, essential oils, bark powder, and phenolic compounds, and each of these properties can play a key role in human health. Recently, many trials have explored the beneficial effects of cinnamon in Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, arthritis, and arteriosclerosis, but still we need further investigations to provide additional clinical evidence for this spice against cancer and inflammatory, cardioprotective, and neurological disorders.	cinnamon cancer
1	Linalool Affects the Antimicrobial Efficacy of Essential Oils.The high concentrations of essential oils are generally required to receive microbial purity of the products (cosmetics, medicine). On the other hand, their application due to the high concentration of essential oils may be limited by changes in organoleptic and textural quality of the products, as well as they cause irritation and allergies in users. Addition of linalool to essential oil may significantly enhance its antimicrobial effectiveness and reduce their concentrations in products, taking advantage of their synergistic and additive effects. The aim of the study was to compare antimicrobial activity of essential oil alone and in combination with linalool. The antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Thymus vulgaris, Juniperus communis, Pelargonium graveolens, Citrus bergamia, Citrus grandis, Lavandula angustifolia, Cinnamomum zeylanicum, Melaleuca alternifolia, Syzygium aromaticum, linalool and their combination was investigated against bacteria and fungi using the disc diffusion method. The addition of linalool to S. aromaticum oil in a synergistic manner enhanced its antimicrobial efficacy against P. aeruginosa and A. brasiliensis. Moreover, the additive interaction between this oil and linalool was observed against S. aureus, E. coli and C. albicans. It was also found that linalool in an additive manner increased the antimicrobial effectiveness of T. vulgaris oil against P. aeruginosa. The antimicrobial properties of mixture of essential oils with their active constituents may be used for creating new strategies to maintain microbiological purity of products. 	pelargonium graveolens linalool
1	Comparison on the fatty acid profiles of liver, subcutaneous fat and muscle from feedlot steers finished on diets supplemented with or without cinnamaldehyde or monensin.BACKGROUND: Cinnamaldehyde (CIN) is the main active component of cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia) oil and has been tested as alternative feed additive in cattle production. Little information was available on the effect of dietary CIN in comparison to monensin (MO) on beef fatty acid (FA) profile. This study analyzed FA profiles of liver, subcutaneous fat and pars costalis diaphragmatis (PCD) muscle obtained from steers (n = 70) finished on diets: control, a barley grain-silage feedlot diet; 330 mg/head.day MO; and 400, 800 or 1600 mg/head.day CIN treatments. RESULTS: Inclusion of MO or CIN did not affect total saturated, unsaturated, polyunsaturated FA and individual FA in the various tissues with exceptions that proportion of palmitic acid in PCD muscle was increased by 800 mg/steer.day CIN (P &lt; 0.05). There were positive correlations (P &lt; 0.05) on oleic, linoleic, conjugated linoleic acid (CLA)-c9,t11 and 18:1-t10 between the subcutaneous fat and PCD muscle, and on alpha-linolenic acid, CLA-c9,t11 and 18:1-t10 between PCD muscle and liver, whereas correlations on the FA between the subcutaneous fat and liver were not significant except for 18:1-t10 (P &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the supplementation of CIN and MO to feedlot diet has limited effect on beef FA profiles.	cinnamomum cassia palmitic acid
2	In vitro anti-Helicobacter pylori action of 30 Chinese herbal medicines used to treat ulcer diseases.Infection by Helicobacter pylori has been ascertained to be an important etiologic impetus leading usually to chronic active gastritis and gastric ulcer with growing incidences worldwide. Utilizing as the test pathogen a standard and five clinic strains of Helicobacter pylori, the antibacterial action was assessed in vitro with ethanol extracts of 30 Chinese herbal medicines which have been frequently prescribed since ancient times for treating gastritis-like disorders. Among the 30 tested materials, the ethanol extracts of Abrus cantoniensis (Fabaceae), Saussurea lappa (Asteraceae) and Eugenia caryophyllata (Myrtaceae) were strongly inhibitory to all test strains (MICs: approximately 40 microg/ml), and Hippophae rhamnoides (Elaeagnaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii (Liliaceae), Magnolia officinalis and Schisandra chinensis (Magnoliaceae), Corydalis yanhusuo (Papaveraceae), Citrus reticulata (Rutaceae), Bupleurum chinense and Ligusticum chuanxiong (Apiaceae) substantially active with MICs close to 60.0 microg/ml. As to antibacterial actions of the aqueous extracts of the same drugs, those derived from Cassia obtusifolia (Fabaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii and Eugenia caryophyllata were remarkably inhibitory against all the six Helicobacter pylori strains (MICs: approximately 60 microg/ml). The work compared almost quantitatively the magnitude of the anti-Helicobacter pylori actions of the 30 most prescribed gastritis-treating Chinese herbal drugs, and located as well some source plants where potent anti-Helicobacter pylori phytochemicals could be characterized.	magnolia officinalis gastric ulcer
2	[Mechanisms and effects of Abelmoschus manihot preparations in treating chronic kidney disease].Abelmoschus manihot (AM) is a medicinal plant rich in twenty kinds of separated active bio-components including flavones, polysaccharides, trannic acid, and long chain hydrocarbons. Among these, total flavones of A. manihot (TFA) are the major active component. In this review, the mechanisms of Huangkui capsule will be discussed as a preparation of AM to treat chronic kidney disease (CKD) by improving immunological reaction, inflammation, renal fibrosis, and renal tubular epithelial injury. Additionally, it has been reported that Huangkui capsule can ameliorate some clinical symptoms, proteinuria, hematuria, and renal function in patients with common CKD, such as nephrotic syndrome, diabetic nephropathy, Henoch-Schonlein purpura nephritis, IgA nephropathy, and membranous nephropathy.

2	The effect of medicinal plants of Islamabad and Murree region of Pakistan on insulin secretion from INS-1 cells.In vitro testing of the extracts of medicinal plants collected from Islamabad and the Murree region on insulin secretagogue activity was carried out. Dried ethanol extracts of all plants (ZH1-ZH19) were dissolved in ethanol and DMSO, and tested at various concentrations (between 1 and 40 microg/mL) for insulin release from INS-1 cells in the presence of 5.5 mM glucose. Glibenclamide was used as a control. Promising insulin secretagogue activity in various plant extracts at 1, 10, 20 and 40 microg/mL was found, while in some cases a decrease in insulin secretion was also observed. Artemisia roxburghiana, Salvia coccinia and Monstera deliciosa showed insulin secretagogue activity at 1 microg/mL (p &lt; 0.05) while Abies pindrow, Centaurea iberica and Euphorbia helioscopia were active at 10 microg/mL (p &lt; 0.05). Extracts of Bauhinia variegata and Bergenia himalacia showed effects at 20 microg/mL (p &lt; 0.05), and Taraxacum officinale and Viburnum foetens at 40 microg/mL (p &lt; 0.05). Insulin secretagogue activity could not be detected in the extracts of Adhatoda vasica, Cassia fistula, Chrysanthemum leucanthemum, Morus alba, Plectranthus rugosus, Peganum harmala and Olea ferruginea. The results suggest that medicinal plants of Islamabad and the Murree region of Pakistan may be potential natural resources for antidiabetic compounds.	centaurea iberica insulin secretion
1	Chemical and biological assessment of Ziziphus jujuba fruits from China: different geographical sources and developmental stages.Chinese date, the fruit of Ziziphus jujuba Mill., has thousands of years cultivation history, and about 700 cultivars of dates in China. Two types of dates are commonly found in the market: (i) fresh immature dates consumed as fruits, and (ii) dried mature dates used as Chinese medicines. Here, chemical and biological properties of these dates were revealed. Different sources of dates showed similar chemical profiles; however, the amounts of identified chemicals showed a great variation. The amount of nucleotides, flavonoids and polysaccharides in dates could be affected by its maturity and drying process. In parallel, the antioxidative functions of their extracts were compared. The date extracts protected PC12 cells against tBHP-induced cytotoxicity, and which also stimulated the transcriptional activity of antioxidant response element. The antioxidative effects were varied among different dates. The current results suggested the optimization of sources and specific usage of different maturity dates. 	ziziphus jujuba mill flavonoids
1	Quantitative and pattern recognition analyses of magnoflorine, spinosin, 6'''-feruloyl spinosin and jujuboside A by HPLC in Zizyphi Semen.Two rapid and simple HPLC methods with UV detector to determine three main compounds (magnoflorine, spinosin and 6'''-feruloyl spinosin) and evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD) to determine jujuboside A were developed for the chemical analyses of Zizyphi Semen. Magnoflorine, spinosin, and 6'''-feruloyl spinosin were separated with an YMC J'sphere ODS-H80 column (250 mm x 4.6 mm, 4 mum) by the gradient elution followed by the isocratic elution using methanol with 0.1 % formic acid and water with 0.1 % formic acid as the mobile phase. The flow rate was 1.0 mL/min. Jujuboside A was separated by HPLC-ELSD with YoungJinBioChrom Aegispak C18-L column (250 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 mum) column in a gradient elution using methanol with 0.1 % formic acid (A) and water with 0.1 % formic acid as the mobile phase. These two methods were fully validated with respect to linearity, precision, accuracy, stability, and robustness. These HPLC methods were applied successfully to quantify four compounds in a Zizyphi Semen extract. The HPLC analytical methods were validated for pattern recognition analysis by repeated analysis of 91 seed samples corresponding to 48 Zizyphus jujuba var. spinosa (J01-J48) and 43 Zizyphus mauritiana (M01-M43). The results indicate that these methods are suitable for a quality evaluation of Zizyphi Semen.	zizyphus jujuba var spinosin
2	The influence of air-dispersed essential oils from lemon (Citrus limon) and silver fir (Abies alba) on airborne bacteria and fungi in hospital rooms.Airborne bacteria and fungi are an ongoing problem in hospitals. Because of the antimicrobial activities of essential oils (EOs) dispersion of EOs into the air may help to reduce this contamination. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the dispersion of selected EOs in reducing the microbial contamination in two hospital wards. The study was carried out at two wards of a 1,227-bed acute-care hospital in Austria. The concentration of airborne bacteria and fungi was measured in patient rooms before and after dispersion of a mixture of Citrus limon EO and Abies alba EO. Before dispersion of the EOs in both wards the mean concentration of bacteria was in a typical range (123 colony forming units (CFU) m-3 and 104 CFU m-3) while the mean concentration of fungi differed substantially (155 CFU m-3 and 28 CFU m-3). After dispersion of the EOs, a reduction in both bacterial and fungal contamination was observed. In the first two hours the mean concentration of airborne bacteria and fungi was reduced by approximately 40% and 30%-60% respectively. The selected EO mixture is effective in reducing the microbial contamination of the indoor air.	abies alba essential oils
2	Chinese herbal medicine for insomnia: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials.Chinese herbal medicine (CHM), either in single herb or in herbal formula, has been used to treat insomnia for more than 2000 years. A systematic review including Chinese and English literature of randomized controlled trials was conducted to examine the efficacy, safety, and composition of CHM for insomnia. Among the 217 studies we have reviewed, only eight had a Jadad score &gt;=3, and seven out of these eight studies had at least one domain with high risks of bias. Meta-analyses of the studies with Jadad score &gt;=3 found that CHM was similar to Western medication (three studies) and placebo (three studies) in treating insomnia. Due to the poor methodological quality of the studies and the small number of trials included in meta-analyses, the current evidence is insufficient to support the efficacy of CHM for insomnia. The frequency of adverse events associated with CHM was similar to that of placebo, but lower than with Western medication. Gui Pi Tang was the most commonly used standardized formula, while Suan Zao Ren (Ziziphus jujuba) was the most frequently used single herb. Further studies with a double-blind placebo-controlled design are needed to accurately determine the benefits and risks of CHM for insomnia.	ziziphus jujuba CHM
2	An unusual manifestation of Abrus precatorius poisoning: a report of two cases.Abrus precatorius seeds are highly toxic and are often ingested as a means of suicide in India. Hemorrhagic gastroenteritis with erosions, hemolysis, acute renal damage, hepatotoxicity with elevated liver enzymes, and seizures are common manifestations of toxicity. We report two cases of Abrus precatorius poisoning with raised intracranial pressure (ICP) and papilledema that have not been described earlier in literature. One patient recovered completely with conservative management to lower raised ICP while the other patient expired before effective treatment could be institutedd. The cases are being reported to propose the need for routine fundus examination and brain imaging in severe abrus poisoning with CNS toxicity, as early institution of treatment for cerebral edema measures may be life saving.	abrus precatorius toxicity
1	On the possibility of lipid-induced regulation of conformation and immunogenicity of influenza a virus H1/N1 hemagglutinin as antigen of TI-complexes.The tubular immunostimulating complex (TI-complex) consisting of cucumarioside A2-2, cholesterol and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) from marine macrophytes is the perspective antigen delivery system for subunit vaccines. MGDG is a lipid matrix for the protein antigen incorporated in the TI-complex. The aim of the present work was to study the influence of MGDGs from different macrophytes on conformation and immunogenicity of the secreted recombinant uncleaved hemagglutinin monomer (HA0S) of influenza A virus H1/N1. Differential scanning calorimetry, fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism showed a dependence of the conformational changes of HA0S on the microviscosity of MGDG. The most viscous MGDG from Zostera marina induced the strongest rearrangements in protein conformation. Immunization of mice with HA0S within TI-complexes comprising different MGDGs resulted in an approximately 2-fold increase of the levels of anti-HA0S antibodies and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) compared with those induced by HA0S alone. TI-complexes based on MGDG from Z. marina stimulated the maximal production of GM-CSF. However, humoral immune response (anti-HA0S antibodies), unlike cell-mediated immune response (GM-CSF), did not depend on the physicochemical properties of MGDGs. It is assumed that this is due to the different localization and conformational lipid sensitivity of the HA0S regions, which are responsible for these types of immune responses.	z. marina MGDG
2	[Antidiabetic activity of Zizyphus mauritiana Lam (Rhamnaceae)].In traditonnal medicine, several plants were used in diabetes treatment. Among them, the aqueous extract from the leaves of Zizyphus mauritiana Lam (Rhamnaceae) was studied. The extract was administrated per os to Wistar rats made diabetics either temporarily by oral glucose tolerance test (first case) or definetely by subcutaneous injection of alloxan (second case). It was observed a striking decrease of the hyperglycemic arrow (p &lt; 0.05) in the first case, with 300 mg/kg administrated 90 minutes before starting the test. In the second case, the results obtained with a dose of 300 mg/kg once or twice a day were identical as those with glibenclamide at 0.2 mg/kg per day. So, the antidiabetic activity of Zizyphus mauritiana Lam was experimentally born out but it has to be standardized for common use.	zizyphus mauritiana diabetics
1	Pressurized liquid extraction and GC-MS analysis for simultaneous determination of seven components in Cinnamomum cassia and the effect of sample preparation.A pressurized liquid extraction and GC-MS method was developed for simultaneous quantitative determination of the seven components, including cinnamaldehyde, copaene, cinnamic acid, coumarin, 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde, 2-methoxycinnamic acid and safrole in Cinnamomum cassia. The results showed that methanol and ethanol was not available for extraction of cinnamaldehyde and 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde due to aldol reaction. The developed method was validated to be sensitive, accurate and simple, and was successfully employed for the analysis of 15 samples of C. cassia. The contents of the investigated components were significantly variant and cinnamaldehyde is the most abundant compound, but safrole was not detected in all samples.	c. cassia 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde
2	The potential of cinnamon to reduce blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance.AIM: Cinnamon has a long history as an antidiabetic spice, but trials involving cinnamon supplementation have produced contrasting results. The aim of this review was to examine the results of randomized controlled clinical trials of cinnamon and evaluate the therapeutic potential amongst patients with diabetes and insulin-resistant patients, particularly the ability to reduce blood glucose levels and inhibit protein glycation. METHODS: A systematic electronic literature search using the medical subject headings 'cinnamon' and 'blood glucose' was carried out to include randomized, placebo-controlled in vivo clinical trials using Cinnamomum verum or Cinnamomum cassia conducted between January 2003 and July 2008. RESULTS: Five type 2 diabetic and three non-diabetic studies (total N = 311) were eligible. Two of the diabetic studies illustrated significant fasting blood glucose (FBG) reductions of 18-29% and 10.3% (p &lt; 0.05), supported by one non-diabetic trial reporting an 8.4% FBG reduction (p &lt; 0.01) vs. placebo, and another illustrating significant reductions in glucose response using oral glucose tolerance tests (p &lt; 0.05). Three diabetic studies reported no significant results. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst definitive conclusions cannot be drawn regarding the use of cinnamon as an antidiabetic therapy, it does possess antihyperglycaemic properties and potential to reduce postprandial blood glucose levels. Further research is required to confirm a possible correlation between baseline FBG and blood glucose reduction and to assess the potential to reduce pathogenic diabetic complications with cinnamon supplementation.	cinnamomum cassia diabetic
3	Prophylactic effects of quercetin and hyperoside in a calcium oxalate stone forming rat model.Quercetin and hyperoside (QH) are the two main constituents of the total flavone glycosides of Flos Abelmoschus manihot, which has been prescribed for treating chronic kidney disease for decades. This study aimed to investigate the effect of QH on calcium oxalate (CaOx) formation in ethylene glycol (EG)-fed rats. Rats were divided into three groups: an untreated stone-forming group, a QH-treated stone-forming group (20 mg/kg/day) and a potassium citrate-treated stone-forming group (potassium citrate was a worldwide-recognized calculi-prophylactic medicine). Ethylene glycol (0.5 %) was administered to the rats during the last week, and vitamin D3 was force-fed to induce hyperoxaluria and kidney calcium oxalate crystal deposition. 24 h urine samples were collected before and after inducing crystal deposits. Rats were killed and both kidneys were harvested after 3 weeks. Bisected kidneys were examined under a polarized light microscope for semi-quantification of the crystal-formation. The renal tissue superoxide dismutase and catalase levels were measured by Western blot. QH and potassium citrate have the ability to alkalinize urine. The number of crystal deposits decreased significantly in the QH-treated stone-forming group as compared to the other groups. Superoxide dismutase and catalase levels also increased significantly in the QH-treated stone-forming group, as compared with the untreated stone-forming group. QH administration has an inhibitory effect on the deposition of CaOx crystal in EG-fed rats and may be effective for preventing stone-forming disease.	hyperoside chronic kidney disease

1	Bioactive A-type proanthocyanidins from Cinnamomum cassia.Two trimeric proanthocyanidins, cinnamtannin B-1 (1) and cinnamtannin D-1 (2), have been isolated from the bark of Cinnamomum cassia along with the known tetramer parameritannin A-1 (3) and a previously unreported tetramer, named cassiatannin A (4). The structures of 1-4 were elucidated on the basis of 1D and 2D NMR, MS, and CD analyses and compared to the reported data. Proanthocyanidins (1-4) possess significant in vitro inhibitory activity against cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) at micromolar concentrations.	cinnamomum cassia cinnamtannin d-1
2	Diagnosis of plant-thorn synovitis by high-resolution ultrasonography: a case report and literature review.Plant-thorn synovitis is an uncommon cause of arthritis and has not been reported in Asian countries. Zanthoxylum ailanthoides, an aromatic plant distributed in East Asia, is used as a spice in Taiwan. We reported a case of acute monoarthritis over the third metacarpo-phalangeal joint of the right hand after an injury by the thorn of the Zanthoxylum ailanthoides. A thorn foreign body of 2.7 mm in length was detected in the joint by high-resolution ultrasonography and led to a surgical synovectomy. The patient recovered completely after synovectomy. Plant-thorn synovitis is easily negligible. Early diagnosis is difficult and frequently delayed. The removal of thorn by synovectomy is the only curative treatment for plant-thorn synovitis. Compared to CT and MRI, ultrasonography is inexpensive, nonradioactive, repeatable, and easily accessible. It could detect foreign bodies that are smaller than 0.5 mm. High-resolution ultrasonography is a useful tool for detecting plant thorn and could promote early diagnosis.	zanthoxylum ailanthoides synovitis
1	Identifying core features of adaptive metabolic mechanisms for chronic heat stress attenuation contributing to systems robustness.The contribution of metabolism to heat stress may play a significant role in defining robustness and recovery of systems; either by providing the energy and metabolites required for cellular homeostasis, or through the generation of protective osmolytes. However, the mechanisms by which heat stress attenuation could be adapted through metabolic processes as a stabilizing strategy against thermal stress are still largely unclear. We address this issue through metabolomic and transcriptomic profiles for populations along a thermal cline where two seagrass species, Zostera marina and Zostera noltii, were found in close proximity. Significant changes captured by these profile comparisons could be detected, with a larger response magnitude observed in northern populations to heat stress. Sucrose, fructose, and myo-inositol were identified to be the most responsive of the 29 analyzed organic metabolites. Many key enzymes in the Calvin cycle, glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathways also showed significant differential expression. The reported comparison suggests that adaptive mechanisms are involved through metabolic pathways to dampen the impacts of heat stress, and interactions between the metabolome and proteome should be further investigated in systems biology to understand robust design features against abiotic stress.	zostera noltii pentose phosphate
1	[Determination of total flavonoids in Abrus cantoniensis and its dynamic changes].OBJECTIVE: To develop a method for ultrasonic extraction and determination of total flavonoids in Abrus cantoniensis, and to analyze its dynamic changes. METHOD: The optimized condition of extraction of total flavonoids was studied with orthogonal design. The contents of total flavonoids in different organs and of different growth stages were determined by UV-visible spectrophotometer. RESULT: The ethanol volume and extraction times were the main factors impacting the effects of ultrasonic extraction. The content of total flavonoids in stems were higher than in roots and the lowest in leaves. The dynamic changes of total flavonoids contents in roots and stems of A. cantoniensis were in similar trends. Its total flavonoids content in the two parts of plant increased gradually with the growth and reached the maximum in October, and the content decreased significantly in Feburay of next year. The content of total flavonoids in leaves reached also to the highest value before leaves fell off. CONCLUSION: The optimized extraction method of total flavonoids in Abrus contoniensis was obtained with three times with 80% ethanol at 20 times of volume for 30 min. The results implied that the best yield and quality may be obtained before leaves fall.	a. cantoniensis flavonoids
1	Protective Effect of Selected Medicinal Plants against Hydrogen Peroxide Induced Oxidative Damage on Biological Substrates.Oxidative stress is developed due to susceptibility of biological substrates to oxidation by generation of free radicals. In degenerative diseases, oxidative stress level can be reduced by antioxidants which neutralize free radicals. Primary objective of this work was to screen four medicinal plants, namely, Andrographis paniculata, Costus speciosus, Canthium parviflorum, and Abrus precatorius, for their antioxidant property using two biological substrates-RBC and microsomes. The antioxidative ability of three solvent extracts, methanol (100% and 80%) and aqueous leaf extracts, was studied at different concentrations by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances method using Fenton's reagent to induce oxidation in the substrates. The polyphenol and flavonoid content were analyzed to relate with the observed antioxidant effect of the extracts. The phytochemical screening indicated the presence of flavonoids, polyphenols, tannins, and beta-carotene in the samples. In microsomes, 80% methanol extract of Canthium and Costus and, in RBC, 80% methanol extract of Costus showed highest inhibition of oxidation and correlated well with the polyphenol and flavonoid content. From the results it can be concluded that antioxidants from medicinal plants are capable of inhibiting oxidation in biological systems, suggesting scope for their use as nutraceuticals. 	costus speciosus flavonoid
2	Characterization and evaluation of bioactive polyphenolic constituents from Zanthoxylum armatum DC., a traditionally used plant.Zanthoxylum armatum or Timoor has been used in different traditional system of medicine due to its aromatic properties and also in the treatment of cancer, diarrhea and cholera. In the present investigation, four chemically distinct compounds namely Tambulin (6), Prudomestin (7), Ombuin (8) and 3, 4, 5, 3', 4', 5'-hexahydroxydiphenyl ether (9) have been isolated and quantified from the fruits. To explore the biological activities, we have further studied the antiproliferative, antimicrobial and antioxidant efficacy. Tambulin which was also found in maximum amount (0.125%) in fruits revealed significant antiproliferative activity (IC50 37.96+-0.36 to 48.7+-0.21mug/mL) against breast, liver, colon and skin cancer cell lines corroborated by resilient binding interaction with SDH (-6.76Kcal/mol) and inhibition constant (Ki: 11.02muM). Hexane and ethyl acetate fraction exhibited moderate antibacterial efficacy (MIC: 250-1000mug/mL) against selected pathogenic microbes while Ombuin displayed broad spectrum antibacterial effect with MIC ranges from 125 to 500mug/mL. Total phenolic content (5.27+-0.06 to 46.12+-0.40mg/g of gallic acid equivalents), total flavonoids content (6.05+-0.24 to 14.46+-0.73mg/g of quercetin equivalents), ferric reducing power (42.35+-0.85 to 62.52+-0.66mg/g of ferrous sulfate equivalents) and percent free radical scavenging activity (59.56+-0.38 to 64.85+-1.78) were also estimated. Our findings infer that Tambulin exhibited significant antiproliferative activity whereas Ombuin was found to display broad spectrum antibacterial activity which adds one more positive attribute to its traditional usage.	zanthoxylum armatum diarrhea
1	Phenanthridine alkaloids from Zanthoxylum madagascariense.Four benzo[c]phenanthridine alkaloids have been isolated from the stem bark of Zanthoxylum madagascariense. These compounds were identified by extensive use of NMR spectroscopy.	zanthoxylum madagascariense benzo[c]phenanthridine alkaloids
1	Efficient quantification of the phenolic profiles of Zanthoxylum bungeanum leaves and correlation between chromatographic fingerprint and antioxidant activity.Sixteen subsequent fractions were prepared from the ethyl acetate fraction of Zanthoxylum bungeanum leaves after bio-guided chromatographic separation. The HPLC profiles and antioxidant activity of the various fractions indicated that the content of eight phenolic compounds (chlorogenic acid, epicatechin, rutin, hyperoside, trifolin, quercitrin, afzelin and quercetin) and antioxidant activity vary significantly, and high concentrations of a combination of eight phenolic compounds would result in an increase of the antioxidant activity. These results suggested that the eight compounds could be used as chemical markers for quality assessment of Z. bungeanum leaves. Correlation between chromatographic fingerprint and antioxidant activity of the fractions showed that quercitrin and hyperoside play crucial roles in the antioxidant activity, and they can be seen as the milestone for quality control. The findings also suggested that five obtained fractions (E-3-3, E-2-4, E-7, E-5 and E-4) could become useful supplements for functional food ingredients and health-related products. 	z. bungeanum trifolin
1	Anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective effects of total flavonoid C-glycosides from Abrus mollis extracts.The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective effects of the total flavonoid C-glycosides isolated from Abrus mollis extracts (AME). In the anti-inflammatory tests, xylene-induced ear edema model in mice and carrageenan-induced paw edema model in rats were applied. The hepatoprotective effects of AME were evaluated with various in vivo models of acute and chronic liver injury, including carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced hepatitis in mice, D-galactosamine (D-GalN)-induced hepatitis in rats, as well as CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis in rats. In the acute inflammation experiment, AME significantly suppressed xylene-induced ear edema and carrageenan-induced paw edema, respectively. In the acute hepatitis tests, AME significantly attenuated the excessive release of ALT and AST induced by CCl4 and D-GalN. In CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis model, AME alleviated liver injury induced by CCl4 shown by histopathological sections of livers and improved liver function as indicated by decreased liver index, serum ALT, AST, TBIL, and ALP levels and hydroxyproline contents in liver tissues, and increased serum ALB and GLU levels. These results indicated that AME possesses potent anti-inflammatory activity in acute inflammation models and hepatoprotective activity in both acute and chronic liver injury models. In conclusion, AME is a potential anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective agent and a viable candidate for treating inflammation, hepatitis, and hepatic fibrosis. 	abrus mollis flavonoid c-glycosides
2	Abrin poisoning.Abrin is a toxic protein obtained from the seeds of Abrus precatorius (jequirity bean), which is similar in structure and properties to ricin. Abrin is highly toxic, with an estimated human fatal dose of 0.1-1 microgram/kg, and has caused death after accidental and intentional poisoning. Abrin can be extracted from jequirity beans using a relatively simple and cheap procedure. This satisfies one criterion of a potential chemical warfare agent, although the lack of large scale production of jequirity seeds means that quantity is unavailable for ready mass production of abrin for weapons. This contrasts with the huge cultivation of Ricinus seeds for castor oil production. At the cellular level, abrin inhibits protein synthesis, thereby causing cell death. Many of the features observed in abrin poisoning can be explained by abrin-induced endothelial cell damage, which causes an increase in capillary permeability with consequent fluid and protein leakage and tissue oedema (the so-called vascular leak syndrome). Most reported cases of human poisoning involve the ingestion of jequirity beans, which predominantly cause gastrointestinal toxicity. Management is symptomatic and supportive. Experimental studies have shown that vaccination with abrin toxoid may offer some protection against a subsequent abrin challenge, although such an approach is unlikely to be of benefit in a civilian population that in all probability would be unprotected.	abrus precatorius vascular leak syndrome
2	Identification of compounds from the water soluble extract of Cinnamomum cassia barks and their inhibitory effects against high-glucose-induced mesangial cells.The difficulty of diabetic nephropathy (DN) treatment makes prevention the best choice. Cinnamomum cassia barks, known as Chinese cinnamon or Chinese cassia, is one of the most popular natural spices and flavoring agents in many parts of the World. Since previous reports indicated that Chinese cinnamon extract could be used for the treatment of diabetes, we proposed that this spice may be beneficial for the prevention of DN. However, the responsible compounds need to be further identified. In this study, we isolated three new phenolic glycosides, cinnacassosides A-C (1-3), together with fifteen known compounds from the water soluble extract of Chinese cinnamon. The structures of the new compounds were identified by comprehensive spectroscopic evidence. Eleven compounds (6-9, 11, 13-18) were isolated from this spice for the first time, despite extensive research on this species in the past, which added new facets for the chemical profiling of this spice. These isolates were purposely evaluated for their inhibitory effects on IL-6 and extracellular matrix production in mesangial cells which are definitely implicated in DN. The results showed that compounds 4-8 could inhibit over secretion of IL-6, collagen IV and fibronectin against high-glucose-induced mesangial cells at 10 mM, suggesting that Chinese cinnamon could be used as a functional food against DN. 	chinese cinnamon diabetes
1	Quantitative and pattern recognition analyses of magnoflorine, spinosin, 6'''-feruloyl spinosin and jujuboside A by HPLC in Zizyphi Semen.Two rapid and simple HPLC methods with UV detector to determine three main compounds (magnoflorine, spinosin and 6'''-feruloyl spinosin) and evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD) to determine jujuboside A were developed for the chemical analyses of Zizyphi Semen. Magnoflorine, spinosin, and 6'''-feruloyl spinosin were separated with an YMC J'sphere ODS-H80 column (250 mm x 4.6 mm, 4 mum) by the gradient elution followed by the isocratic elution using methanol with 0.1 % formic acid and water with 0.1 % formic acid as the mobile phase. The flow rate was 1.0 mL/min. Jujuboside A was separated by HPLC-ELSD with YoungJinBioChrom Aegispak C18-L column (250 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 mum) column in a gradient elution using methanol with 0.1 % formic acid (A) and water with 0.1 % formic acid as the mobile phase. These two methods were fully validated with respect to linearity, precision, accuracy, stability, and robustness. These HPLC methods were applied successfully to quantify four compounds in a Zizyphi Semen extract. The HPLC analytical methods were validated for pattern recognition analysis by repeated analysis of 91 seed samples corresponding to 48 Zizyphus jujuba var. spinosa (J01-J48) and 43 Zizyphus mauritiana (M01-M43). The results indicate that these methods are suitable for a quality evaluation of Zizyphi Semen.	z. schinifolium glycosides
1	Anti-complementary activity of triterpenoides from fruits of Zizyphus jujuba.In order to determine on the anti-complement activity of triterpenes, following eleven triterpenoides were isolated from the fruits of the Zizyphus jujuba MILL: ceanothane-type triterpenes: colubrinic acid (1), zizyberenalic acid (11); lupane-type triterpenes: alphitolic acid (2), 3-O-cis-p-coumaroyl alphitolic acid (3), 3-O-trans-p-coumaroyl alphitolic acid (4), betulinic acid (7), betulonic acid (9); and oleanane-type triterpenes: 3-O-cis-p-coumaroyl maslinic acid (5), 3-O-trans-p-coumaroyl maslinic acid (6), oleanolic acid (8), oleanonic acid (10). These compounds were examined for their anti-complement activity against the classical pathway of the complement system. Among them, compounds 5, 6, and 8 exhibited significant anti-complement activity with IC(50) values of 101.4, 143.9, and 163.4 microM, respectively, whereas the ceanothane-type and the lupane-type triterpenes were inactive. This suggests that the oleanane-structure plays an important role in inhibiting the hemolytic activity of human serum against erythrocytes.	zizyphus jujuba oleanane
3	Two lanostane triterpenoids from Abies koreana.Two lanostane-type triterpenoids, namely, 24(E)-3,4-seco-9betaH-lanosta-4(28),7,24-triene-3,26-dioic acid and 24(E)-3-oxo-9betaH-lanosta-7,24-dien-26-ol were isolated from the root bark of Abies koreana. Their structures were established based on spectroscopic analyses. Compound 2 exhibited marginal cytotoxicity against human tumor cell lines.	triterpenoids cytotoxicity
1	Acaricidal properties of the essential oil from Zanthoxylum caribaeum against Rhipicephalus microplus.Zanthoxylum caribaeum Lamarck (Rutaceae) is plant species with a variety of medical applications, including insecticidal activity. This study determined the bioacaricidal activity of the essential oil from Z. caribaeum leaves against engorged Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus (Canestrini, 1887) females using the adult immersion test. For this purpose, three serial concentrations (5.0, 2.5, and 1.25%, vol:vol, in 1% dimetilsulfoxide) of the essential oil were used. Essential oil 5% caused 65% mortality on the first day after treatment, 85% on the second day, and 100% mortality by the fifth day. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the acaricidal activity of the essential oil from Z. caribaeum leaves against cattle ticks.	cattle ticks essential oil
1	Differentiating parts of Cinnamomum cassia using LC-qTOF-MS in conjunction with principal component analysis.Cinnamon bark (Rou Gui in Chinese), cinnamon twig (Gui Zhi) and shaved cinnamon bark (Gui Sin) have been widely used as spices and in traditional Chinese medicine since ancient times. On-going issues related to quality and authenticity necessitate the development of analytical methods capable of providing an objective evaluation of samples. In this study, chemical fingerprints of cinnamon bark, cinnamon twigs and shaved cinnamon bark were established using liquid chromatography quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometry in conjunction with principal component analysis (PCA). From 125 samples of cinnamon, we identified the following eight compounds and their the detection ratios: coumarin, cinnamaldehyde, cinnamyl alcohol, cinnamic acid, 2-hydroxycinnamaldehyde, 2-hydroxycinnamic acid, 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde and 4-methoxycinnamaldehyde. Of these, 4-methoxycinnamaldehyde presented the largest variations in detection ratio, making up 64.0, 97.4 and 50.0% in cinnamon bark, cinnamon twig, and shaved cinnamon bark, respectively. The quantities of cinnamyl alcohol, coumarin and cinnamaldehyde also varied between the three parts of the plant. Chemical fingerprints of the three cinnamon samples were established using principal component analysis, the results of which indicate that cinnamon bark and shaved cinnamon bark could be easily differentiated, despite a marked similarity in outward appearance. Cinnamon twig was also shown to depart from the other clusters. The proposed method provides a fast and efficient means of identifying cinnamon herbs for quality control purposes.

Trans-cinnamaldehyde, as a preventive care of nature medicine, has great clinical and market potential. This paper gives a review about the pharmacological effects and mechanism of trans-cinnamaldehyde researched in the latest five years. We hope to provide some basic information for further research on trans-cinnamaldehyde.	trans-cinnamaldehyde cancer
2	Bioactive Fraction of Annona reticulata Bark (or) Ziziphus jujuba Root Bark along with Insulin Attenuates Painful Diabetic Neuropathy through Inhibiting NF-kappaB Inflammatory Cascade.The present study explains the neuroprotective ability of bioactive fractions of Annona reticulata bark (ARB) and Ziziphus jujuba root bark (ZJ) along with insulin against diabetic neuropathy. By using different solvents of increasing polarity ARB and ZJ were undergone for bioactive guided fractionation. The neuroprotective ability of the all the plant fractions were tested against H2O2 induced toxicity in SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cell lines and DRG neuronal cells. Among all the fractions tested, the methanol extract of ARB and ZJ (ARBME and ZJME) and its water fractions (ARBWF and ZJWF) exhibited significant neuroprotection against H2O2 induced toxicity in SHSY5Y cells and DRG neuronal cells. Further both the active fractions were tested against streptozotocin (55 mg/kg i.p.) induced diabetic neuropathy in male Wistar rats. Body weight changes, blood glucose levels and pain threshold through hot plate, tail immersion, cold plate and Randall-Sillitto methods were measured throughout the study at weekly interval. After completion of the drug treatment period, all the animals were sacrificed to measure the sciatic nerve lipid peroxidation, antioxidative enzyme levels (SOD, catalase, and GSH) and cytokine levels (IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, iNOS, and NFkappaB) through ELISA and western blotting analysis. Results of this study explain that ARBME, ZJME, ARBWF, and ZJWF along with insulin potentially attenuate the thermal, mechanical hyperalgesia and cold allodynia in diabetic neuropathic rats, where insulin treatment alone failed to diminish the same. Reduction of sciatic nerve oxidative stress, NF-kappaB and iNOS mediated inflammatory cascade and normalization of abnormal cytokine release confirms the possible mechanism of action. The present study confirms the neuroprotective ability of ARB and ZJ against painful diabetic neuropathy through inhibiting oxidative stress and NF-kappaB inflammatory cascade.	ziziphus jujuba painful diabetic neuropathy
3	Potent antiplatelet, anti-inflammatory and antiallergic isoflavanquinones from the roots of Abrus precatorius.Five isoflavanquinones have been isolated from the roots of Abrus precatorius L. (Leguminosae). Three of them are new and designated as abruquinones D, E, and F. The pharmacological activities of the isoflavanquinones have been evaluated. The results indicated that abruquinones A, B, and D exhibited remarkable inhibitory effects on the platelet aggregation. The IC50 of abruquinones A and B for the inhibition of the platelet aggregation induced by arachidonic acid (AA) and collagen were less than 5 micrograms/ml, and of abruquinone D, was less than 10 micrograms/ml for that induced by AA. On the other hand, abruquinones A, B, D, and F showed strong anti-inflammatory and antiallergic effects. The IC50 of abruquinones A, B, D, and F for the inhibition of superoxide formation were less than 0.3 micrograms/ml, for the inhibition of the release of both beta-glucuronidase and lysozyme from rat neutrophils and the release of both beta-glucuronidase and histamine from mast cells were less than 1 microgram/ml.	isoflavanquinones platelet aggregation
1	Protective Effect of Selected Medicinal Plants against Hydrogen Peroxide Induced Oxidative Damage on Biological Substrates.Oxidative stress is developed due to susceptibility of biological substrates to oxidation by generation of free radicals. In degenerative diseases, oxidative stress level can be reduced by antioxidants which neutralize free radicals. Primary objective of this work was to screen four medicinal plants, namely, Andrographis paniculata, Costus speciosus, Canthium parviflorum, and Abrus precatorius, for their antioxidant property using two biological substrates-RBC and microsomes. The antioxidative ability of three solvent extracts, methanol (100% and 80%) and aqueous leaf extracts, was studied at different concentrations by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances method using Fenton's reagent to induce oxidation in the substrates. The polyphenol and flavonoid content were analyzed to relate with the observed antioxidant effect of the extracts. The phytochemical screening indicated the presence of flavonoids, polyphenols, tannins, and beta-carotene in the samples. In microsomes, 80% methanol extract of Canthium and Costus and, in RBC, 80% methanol extract of Costus showed highest inhibition of oxidation and correlated well with the polyphenol and flavonoid content. From the results it can be concluded that antioxidants from medicinal plants are capable of inhibiting oxidation in biological systems, suggesting scope for their use as nutraceuticals. 	andrographis paniculata tannins
1	Application of microdialysis for elucidating the existing form of hyperoside in rat brain: comparison between intragastric and intraperitoneal administration.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort) is an important anti-depressant herb used in clinic and commonly prescribed for mild depression. Hyperoside is one of the major components of H. perforatum and is also detected in many plant species such as Abelmoschus manihot, Black Currant, Rosa agrestis, Apocynum venetum and Nelumbo nucifera. AIM OF THE STUDY: As the hyperoside showed CNS (central nervous system) protective activity (e.g. anti-depressant-like effect), the possibility of hyperoside or its metabolites to reach CNS should be investigated. Moreover, the pharmacokinetics profile of hyperoside or its metabolites in rat brain should be studied for further elucidating the mechanism of hyperoside action on CNS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A simple method for simultaneous determination of unbound hyperoside and its metabolite 3'-O-methyl-hyperoside in rat brain was developed by using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) and microdialysis technique. This method was applied for pharmacokinetics study of hyperoside and 3'-O-methyl-hyperoside in rat brain after intragastric (i.g.) and intraperitoneally (i.p.) administration of hyperoside in vivo. RESULTS: Results showed that neither hyperoside nor its metabolites were detected in rat brain after i.g. administration but both compounds could be detected after i.p. administration. Considering the activity of hyperoside through both i.g. and i.p. administration, our results imply that the active components of hyperoside in vivo might be different. Therefore, further studies are needed to identify the active components of hyperoside in vivo through these two different routes. Moreover, non-oral administration route (e.g., i.p.) should be further investigated and be explored to obtain higher bioavailability and better activity for hyperoside. Our results also showed that the real existing form of hyperoside in rat brain were hyperoside and its methylated metabolite with maximum concentration to be 63.78 ng/mL and 24.66 ng/mL after 20mg/kg i.p. administration, respectively. Therefore, a more reasonable concentration of hyperoside should be considered in in vitro assay to reflect the real situation of hyperoside concentration in vivo. CONCLUSION: Due to the wide use of herbal remedies containing hyperoside, our investigation will contribute to further clarifying the action of this substance. Moreover, this method will be applied for clinical pharmacokinetics study of hyperoside and its metabolite as well as herbs that contain hyperoside.	apocynum venetum hyperoside
2	[Effect of guizhi decoction on PKA and PKC activities of hypothalamus in fever rats].OBJECTIVE: To investigate the changes of the activity of both protein kinase A and C and the mechanisms of antipyretic action of Guizhi decoction. METHOD: The fever responses were observed after combination injection of H-89 (a selective inhibitor of PKA) and calphostin C (a selective inhibitor of PKC), and oral pretreatment of Guizhi decoction in fever rats induced by an intra-cerebroventricular (icv) injection of an EP3 agonist, and both PKA and PKC activity in hypothalamus were measured in rats pretreated with Guizhi decoction and vehicle using isotopic tracing assay. RESULT: The rise in rat body temperature was inhibited by H-89, Calphostin C, and Guizhi decoction, moreover, pretreatment with Guizhi decoction reduced PKA activity obviously. PKC activity in model rats exhibited a tendency to drop compared with that of control group, Oral administration of Guizhi decoction in large dose inhibited the response significantly, while the low dose of Guzhi decoction has no effect on PKC. CONCLUSION: Both PKA and PKC may participate in the mechanism of fever induction by EP3 agonist. The decrease of PKA and PKC may contribute to the antipyretic action of Guizhi decoction, some isoenzyme of PKC may play a role in the fever production.	guizhi fever
2	Effect of Zizyphus jujuba fruits on dyslipidemia in obese adolescents: a triple-masked randomized controlled clinical trial.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the effects of Ziziphus jujuba (ZJ) fruit on controlling dyslipidemia in obese adolescents. METHODS: This triple-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial comprised 86 obese adolescents aged 12-18 years with dyslipidemia, i.e. serum low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) or total cholesterol (TC) or triglycerides (TG) equal or more than the age- and gender-specific 95th percentile or high density lipoprotein- cholesterol (HDL-C) less than 5th percentile. They were randomly assigned into two groups of equal number Both groups received similar recommendations for dietary and physical activity habits. The case group received 5 grams of ZJ fruit powder three times a day for one month and controls took the same amount of a placebo powder. Fasting blood sugar, TC, LDL-C, HDL-C and TG were measured at the beginning and at the end of the trial. Data were analyzed using General linear method (multivariate) test. FINDINGS: Overall, 70 participants (51% boys, mean age of 14 +/- 2) completed the trial. The two groups studied did not differ in terms of age, gender, weight and body mass index (BMI). After the trial, serum TC decreased significantly (19 +/- 37 mg/dl in controls vs. 170 +/- 29 mg/dl in cases, P = 0.007) reduction. The corresponding figure was also significant for LDL-C (114 +/- 38 mg/dl vs. 104 +/- 22 mg/dl, respectively, P = 0.004). The changes in BMI and other lipids were not significant. CONCLUSION: This study suggest that ZJ's fruits is generally well tolerated and may have potential favorable effects on serum lipid profile. While healthy lifestyle is the mainstay of controlling childhood obesity, this nutraceutical may be considered as a complementary treatment. Key words: Zizyphus, dyslipidemia, adolescence, obesity.

2	Solid- and vapor-phase antimicrobial activities of six essential oils: susceptibility of selected foodborne bacterial and fungal strains.The antimicrobial activity of essential oils (EOs) of cinnamon (Cinnamon zeylanicum), clove (Syzygium aromaticum), basil (Ocimum basillicum), rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), dill (Anethum graveolens), and ginger (Zingiber officinalis) was evaluated over a range of concentrations in two types of contact tests (solid and vapor diffusion). The EOs were tested against an array of four Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Listeria monocytogenes), four Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella choleraesuis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and three fungi (a yeast, Candida albicans, and two molds, Penicillium islandicum and Aspergillus flavus). The rationale for this work was to test the possibility of creating a protective atmosphere by using natural compounds that could extend the shelf life of packaged foodstuffs while minimizing organoleptic alterations. In the solid diffusion tests, cinnamon and clove gave the strongest (and very similar) inhibition, followed by basil and rosemary, with dill and ginger giving the weakest inhibition. The fungi were the most sensitive microorganisms, followed by the Gram-positive bacterial strains. The Gram-negative strain P. aeruginosa was the least inhibited. The composition of the atmosphere generated by the EOs, and their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), were determined using a disk volatilization method, in which no inhibition from rosemary or basil was observed. Cinnamon and clove, once again, gave similar results for every microorganism. As a general rule, MIC (fungi) &lt;&lt; MIC (bacteria) with no clear differences between Gram-positive or -negative strains except for P. aeruginosa, which was not inhibited by any of the EOs in the vapor phase. The atmosphere generated from the EOs was analyzed by means of solid-phase microextraction combined with gas chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry. Differences among the volatiles in the EOs, which may be responsible for the differences in their antimicrobial performances, were found.	Cinnamon antimicrobial performances
2	Medicinal plants from nepal: evaluation as inhibitors of leukotriene biosynthesis.The methanolic extracts of 25 different Nepalese medicinal plants were tested for their activity to inhibit the biosynthesis of leukotriene B(4) in bovine polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The selected indigenous plants are used in traditional herb remedies to treat inflammatory diseases such as asthma, bronchitis, rheumatism, and skin disorders presumed to be mediated by leukotrienes. The leaves of Zanthoxylum nepalensis were shown to be the most potent inhibitor with an IC(50) value of 11 microgram/ml. The extracts obtained from Astercantha longifolia and Hedychium ellipticum also exhibited potent inhibitory action with IC(50) values of 20 and 22 microgram/ml, respectively.	hedychium ellipticum skin disorders
2	Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology of Ziziphus jujuba Mills.Ziziphus jujuba Mills, 'annab' in Iran, 'ber' in India or 'pomme sourette' in France, is a species whose fruit (known warmly as 'the fruits of life' in China) has been consumed for centuries for its nutritional value. The food industry used it as a food additive and flavoring. The dry seeds, the crude leaves and the stem bark are still used in ethnopharmacology to treat digestive disorders and gastric ulcers as antitussive, laxative and hypotensive drugs; even now, it is used in China to treat children who suffer from typhoid fever, furuncle and ecthyma. In Taiwan, the dry seeds for the variety spinosa (Suan Zao Ren) are the second most commonly prescribed and used phytomedicine for insomnia. Its popularity and production have increased worldwide in recent years, especially in Europe. The European Pharmacopoeia Commission has been unable to elaborate upon the EP monograph on Ziziphi spinosae semen as was planned. The EMA has not made its recommendations yet. Is it still a gap in the scientific knowledge? Or is difficult for traditional Chinese medicinal herbs to fulfill the style and quality parameters that are required?

1	Optimization of the separation and determination of nitidine and chelerythrine in Zanthoxylum nitidum by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection.A new ion-pair high-performance liquid chromatography method with fluorescence detection was developed for the determination of nitidine and chelerythrine in Zanthoxylum nitidum. To optimize the separation of the two compounds in reversed-phase liquid chromatography, a response surface method (Box-Behnken designs) was used. Three important factors: concentration of ion pair agent, mobile phase composition and buffer pH, were studied for their contribution to the analytes' response, leading to a total of 17 experiments performed on a Kromasil C18 column. The experimental responses were fitted into a second-order polynomial to predict the best conditions. The optimal mobile phase conditions were predicted to be acetonitrile-sodium dodecyl sulphate (17.8 mM, 20 mM citric acid, pH 2.98, 57:43, v/v). The proposed method was validated according to International Conference on Harmonization guidelines and it is suggested to be appropriate for the routine quality control analysis of nitidine and chelerythrine in Zanthoxylum nitidum. 	zanthoxylum nitidum nitidine
1	Quantitative and pattern recognition analyses of magnoflorine, spinosin, 6'''-feruloyl spinosin and jujuboside A by HPLC in Zizyphi Semen.Two rapid and simple HPLC methods with UV detector to determine three main compounds (magnoflorine, spinosin and 6'''-feruloyl spinosin) and evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD) to determine jujuboside A were developed for the chemical analyses of Zizyphi Semen. Magnoflorine, spinosin, and 6'''-feruloyl spinosin were separated with an YMC J'sphere ODS-H80 column (250 mm x 4.6 mm, 4 mum) by the gradient elution followed by the isocratic elution using methanol with 0.1 % formic acid and water with 0.1 % formic acid as the mobile phase. The flow rate was 1.0 mL/min. Jujuboside A was separated by HPLC-ELSD with YoungJinBioChrom Aegispak C18-L column (250 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 mum) column in a gradient elution using methanol with 0.1 % formic acid (A) and water with 0.1 % formic acid as the mobile phase. These two methods were fully validated with respect to linearity, precision, accuracy, stability, and robustness. These HPLC methods were applied successfully to quantify four compounds in a Zizyphi Semen extract. The HPLC analytical methods were validated for pattern recognition analysis by repeated analysis of 91 seed samples corresponding to 48 Zizyphus jujuba var. spinosa (J01-J48) and 43 Zizyphus mauritiana (M01-M43). The results indicate that these methods are suitable for a quality evaluation of Zizyphi Semen.	zizyphus jujuba var magnoflorine
1	Toxicity of Zanthoxylum piperitum and Zanthoxylum armatum oil constituents and related compounds to Stomoxys calcitrans (Diptera: Muscidae).Zanthoxylum plants (Rutaceae) have drawn attention because they contain insecticidal principles against insects. An assessment was made of the insecticidal and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activities of Zanthoxylum piperitum steam distillate and Zanthoxylum armatum seed oil, their 28 constituents, and eight structurally related compounds against female stable fly, Stomoxys calcitrans (L.). Results were compared with those of two organophosphorus insecticides chlorpyrifos and dichlorvos. Potent fumigant toxicity was observed with cuminaldehyde, thymol, (1S)-(-)-verbenone, (-)-myrtenal, carvacrol, (S)-(Z)-verbenol, Zanthoxylum piperitum steam distillate, cuminyl alcohol, Zanthoxylum armatum seed oil, piperitone, (-)-(Z)-myrtanol, and citronellal (LC50, 0.075-0.456 microg/cm3). However, they were five orders of magnitude less toxic than either chlorpyrifos or dichlorvos. An in vitro bioassay using female fly heads indicates that strong AChE inhibition was produced by citronellyl acetate, alpha-pinene, thymol, carvacrol, and alpha-terpineol (1.20-2.73 mM), but no direct correlation between fly toxicity and AChE inhibition by the test compounds was observed. Structure-activity relationships indicate that structural characteristics, such as carbon skeleton, degrees of saturation and types of functional groups, and vapor pressure parameter, appear to play a role in determining toxicities of the test monoterpenoids to stable flies. Global efforts to reduce the level of highly toxic synthetic insecticides in the agricultural environment justify further studies on Z. piperitum and Z. armatum oil-derived materials as potential insecticides for the control of stable fly populations.	z. piperitum carvacrol
1	Purification and characterization of flavonoids from the leaves of Zanthoxylum bungeanum and correlation between their structure and antioxidant activity.Nine flavonoids were isolated and characterized from the leaves of Zanthoxylum bungeanum. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic techniques as quercetin (1), afzelin (2), quercitrin (3), trifolin (4), quercetin-3-O-beta-D-glucoside (5), isorhamnetin 3-O-alpha-L-rhamnoside (6), hyperoside (7), vitexin (8) and rutin (9). All compounds were isolated from the leaves of Z. bungeanum for the first time. Five compounds (2, 4, 5, 6 and 8) were found for the first time in the genus Zanthoxylum. To learn the mechanisms underlying its health benefits, in vitro (DPPH, ABTS, FRAP and lipid peroxidation inhibition assays) and in vivo (protective effect on Escherichia coli under peroxide stress) antioxidant activities of the nine flavonoids were measured. Quercetin and quercetin glycosides (compounds 1, 3, 5, 7, 9) showed the highest antioxidant activity. Structure-activity relationships indicated that the -OH in 4' position on the B ring and the -OH in 7 position on the A ring possessed high antioxidant activity; B ring and/or A ring with adjacent -OH groups could greatly increase their antioxidant ability. Also, due to the different structures of various flavonoids, they will certainly exhibit different antioxidant capacity when the reactions occur in solution or in oil-in-water emulsion. These findings suggest that Z. bungeanum leaves may have health benefits when consumed. It could become a useful supplement for pharmaceutical products and functional food ingredients in both nutraceutical and food industries as a potential source of natural antioxidants. 	z. bungeanum hyperoside
3	Anti-inflammatory activity of (E)-1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl) butadiene from Zingiber cassumunar Roxb.This study aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory activity of (E)-1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl) butadiene (DMPBD), isolated from Zingiber cassumunar Roxb., using in vivo and in vitro models. The results show that DMPBD dose-dependently inhibited the rat ear edema induced by ethyl phenylpropiolate (EPP), arachidonic acid (AA) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) and it was more potent than any other standard drugs being used. In EPP-induced edema IC(50) of DMPBD and oxyphenbutazone were 21 and 136nmol per ear, respectively. The IC(50) of DMPBD and phenidone were 60 and 2520nmol per ear, respectively, in AA-induced edema whereas DMPBD was 11 times more potent than diclofenac in TPA-induced edema (IC(50)=660 and 7200pmol per ear, respectively). DMPBD and diclofenac inhibited the rat paw edema induced by carrageenan but not by platelet activating factor (PAF). In in vitro study DMPBD, aspirin and phenidone inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation with IC(50) of 0.35, 0.43 and 0.03mM, respectively. Whereas IC(50) of these agents in ADP, AA and PAF inductions were 4.85, 3.98 and 1.30mM; 0.94, 0.13 and 0.04mM; and 1.14, 6.96 and 2.40mM, respectively. These results indicate that DMPBD possesses a potent anti-inflammatory activity through the inhibition of CO and LO pathways and seems to have more prominent effects on the LO pathway.

2	Cinnamomum cassia extracts reverses TGF-beta1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in human lung adenocarcinoma cells and suppresses tumor growth in vivo.Metastasis is the most common cause of cancer-related mortality in patients, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is essential for cancer metastasis and antidrug resistance. Cinnamomum cassia has several antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer biological effects. However, the anti-EMT effect of C. cassia in human lung carcinoma is rarely reported. In this study, we determined whether C. cassia extracts (CCE) reduces the EMT and tumor growth of human lung adenocarcinoma cells. CCE inhibited the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1-induced cell motility and invasiveness of A549 and H1299 cells by repressing matrix metalloproteinase-2 and urokinase-type plasminogen activator as well as impaired cell adhesion to collagen. CCE also affected the TGF-beta1-induced EMT by downregulating the expression of vimentin and fibronectin and upregulating E-cadherin. The nude mice xenograft model showed that CCE reduced A549 tumor growth. Thus, CCE possesses antimetastatic activity of A549 and H1299 cells by affecting EMT and suppressing A549 tumor growth in vivo. This result suggested that CCE could be used as an antimetastatic agent or as an adjuvant for anticancer therapy.	c. cassia lung adenocarcinoma
0	Protective effect of cinnamaldehyde against glutamate-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in PC12 cells.Cinnamaldehyde is a main ingredient of cinnamon oils from the stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia, which has been widely used in food and traditional herbal medicine in Asia. In the present study, the neuroprotective effects and the potential mechanisms of cinnamaldehyde against glutamate-induced oxidative stress in PC12 cells were investigated. Exposure to 4mM glutamate altered the GSH, MDA levels and SOD activity, caused the generation of reactive oxygen species, resulted in the induction of oxidative stress in PC12 cell, ultimately induced cell death. However, pretreatment with cinnamaldehyde at 5, 10 and 20muM significantly attenuated cell viability loss, reduced the generation of reactive oxygen species, stabilised mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), decreased the release of cytochrome c and limited the activities of caspase-9 and -3. In addition, cinnamaldehyde also markedly increased Bcl-2 while inhibiting Bax expression,and decreased the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio. These results indicate that cinnamaldehyde exists a potential protective effect against glutamate-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in PC12 cells.	cinnamaldehyde Bcl-2
2	Screening of some Tanzanian medicinal plants for their trypanocidal and cytotoxic activities.The objective of the present study was to evaluate in vitro antitrypanosomal and cytotoxic activities of crude extracts of 20 traditionally used medicinal plants of Tanzania. A total of 40 extracts (dichloromethane and methanol) were screened for antiproliferative activity of bloodstream form of T. b. brucei and human leukaemia HL-60 cell. Inhibition of cell proliferation was assessed using resazurin as vital stain. Of the 40 extracts tested, the dichloromethane extract from bark of Warburgia salutaris (Canellaceae) exhibited the most potent antitrypanosomal activity with an IC(50) value of 10.68 microg/ml. A dichloromethane extract from Lannea stuhlmannii (Anacardiaceae) was found to be the most cytotoxic extract against HL-60 (IC(50) = 27.15 microg/ml). Out of the 20 plants tested, 5 plants exhibited trypanocidal activity with IC(50) values below 20 microg/ml. These 5 plants: Entandrophragma bussei (Meliaceae), Securidaca longepedunculata (Polygalaceae), Warburgia salutaris (Canellaceae), Zanha africana (Sapindaceae) and Zanthoxylum chalybeum (Rutaceae) could therefore serve as sources of lead compounds for treatment of trypanosomiasis.	zanthoxylum chalybeum trypanosomiasis
1	Foliar and cortex oleoresin variability of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) in Albania.Terpene composition of needle and cortical oleoresin from lateral shoots were analyzed by GC/MS for four Silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) populations scattered in natural species range in Albania. More than sixty compounds were detected in the needle oleoresin, which was characterized by a high content of alpha-pinene, camphene, beta-pinene, limonene and bornyl acetate. Three monoterpenes, alpha-pinene, beta-pinene and limonene, and two sesquiterpenes, beta-caryophyllene and germacrene D, comprised the majority of cortical oleoresin. The terpene composition differences among the populations that led to the recognition of two chemotypes. The needle oleoresin from the provinces of Puka, Bulqiza and Llogara were characterised by high amounts of beta-pinene, camphene and alpha-pinene and low amounts of limonene, while that from Drenova had high amounts of beta-pinene and limonene. A similar pattern was found in the cortical oleoresin with the exception of camphene that was a minor contributor. Geographical and seasonal variation between the populations was, also, investigated. Multivariate analysis of both needle and cortical oleoresin separated Drenova (southeastern population) from the other sites. When both major monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes were considered four chemical profiles could be attributed. Based on their chemical profiles, the populations can be divided into two groups: Populations with high content of beta-pinene and alpha-pinene but a low content of limonene (Puka, Bulqiza and Llogara), typical of most of A. alba populations in all its distribution range. Population with a high content of limonene and a moderate content of beta-pinene and alpha-pinene (Drenova).	a. alba terpene
2	Characterization of isobutylhydroxyamides with NGF-potentiating activity from Zanthoxylum bungeanum.Eight isobutylhydroxyamides, including three new (1-3), qinbunamides A-C, and five known sanshools (4-8), ZP-amide A (4), ZP-amide B (5), ZP-amide E (6), ZP-amide C (7), and ZP-amide D (8), were isolated from the pericarps of cultivated Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim, cultivated in Qinling mountain area, Shaanxi, China. The structures of all compounds were determined on the basis of spectroscopic techniques, including 1D and 2D NMR analysis and comparison with previously reported data. Compounds 1 and 2 are the first example of isobutylhydroxyamides containing an ethoxy group, and compound 3 is a rare C11 fatty acid-containing sanshool existing in genus Zanthoxylum. The tested compounds enhanced nerve growth factor (NGF)-mediated neurite outgrowth (neurotrophic activity) in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells, but were inactive in the inhibitory effects on the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical and growth of HCT116 cells at concentrations of 50muM.

1	Phytochemical and biological activities of four wild medicinal plants.The fruits of four wild plants, namely, Capparis decidua, Ficus carica, Syzygium cumini, and Ziziphus jujuba, are separately used as traditional dietary and remedial agents in remote areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. The results of our study on these four plants revealed that the examined fruits were a valuable source of nutraceuticals and exhibited good level of antimicrobial activity. The fruits of these four investigated plants are promising source of polyphenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, and saponins. These four plants' fruits are good sources of iron, zinc, copper, manganese, selenium, and chromium. It was also observed that these fruits are potential source of antioxidant agent and the possible reason could be that these samples had good amount of phytochemicals. Hence, the proper propagation, conservation, and chemical investigation are recommended so that these fruits should be incorporated for the eradication of food and health related problems. 	ficus carica polyphenols
2	Medicinal plants from nepal: evaluation as inhibitors of leukotriene biosynthesis.The methanolic extracts of 25 different Nepalese medicinal plants were tested for their activity to inhibit the biosynthesis of leukotriene B(4) in bovine polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The selected indigenous plants are used in traditional herb remedies to treat inflammatory diseases such as asthma, bronchitis, rheumatism, and skin disorders presumed to be mediated by leukotrienes. The leaves of Zanthoxylum nepalensis were shown to be the most potent inhibitor with an IC(50) value of 11 microgram/ml. The extracts obtained from Astercantha longifolia and Hedychium ellipticum also exhibited potent inhibitory action with IC(50) values of 20 and 22 microgram/ml, respectively.	hedychium ellipticum rheumatism
1	Mast cell stabilizing and antiallergic activity of Abrus precatorius in the management of asthma.OBJECTIVE: To investigate effects of ethanol extract of Abrus precatorius leaves (EAPL) on egg albumin induced mast cell degranulation in mice and passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in rats. METHODS: In present study ethanol extract of Abrus precatorius leaves (EAPL) at doses of 100, 125, 150 mg/kg i.p were evaluated for preliminary phytochemical screening, acute toxicity studies and egg albumin induced mast cell degranulation in mice and passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in rats. RESULTS: The results of present investigation showed that the LD(50) of EAPL is more than 1 300 mg/kg. EAPL (100-150 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly protect egg albumin induced degranulation of mast cell and inhibit area of leakage of dye in passive cutaneous anaphylaxis. Phytochemical studies observed presence of saponin, alkaloids, flavonoids, and glycosides. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion EAPL possesses anti asthmatic potential.	abrus precatorius alkaloids
1	The complete amino acid sequences of the B-chains of abrin-a and abrin-b, toxic proteins from the seeds of Abrus precatorius.The amino acids of the B-chains of two abrins (designated as abrin-a and abrin-b) from the seeds of Abrus precatorius have been sequenced. The sequence of the B-chain of abrin-a was solved by analysis of peptides derived by enzymatic digestions with trypsin, lysylendopeptidase, and chymotrypsin, as well as by chemical cleavage with cyanogen bromide. The sequence of the B-chain of abrin-b was analyzed by sequence analysis of tryptic peptides and comparing these sequences with those of corresponding peptides of the B-chain of abrin-a. The B-chains of abrin-a and abrin-b consist of 268 amino acid residues and share 256 identical residues. Comparison of their sequences with that of the ricin B-chain shows that 60% of the residues of both abrin B-chains are identical to those of the ricin B-chain and that two saccharide-binding sites in ricin B-chain identified by a crystallographic study are highly conserved in both abrin B-chains.	abrus precatorius saccharide
1	Identification of the potential active components of Abelmoschus manihot in rat blood and kidney tissue by microdialysis combined with ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry.In this paper, microdialysis combining with ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) was applied to simultaneously identify components in blood and kidney dialysis after oral administration of Abelmoschus manihot extract. Microdialysis probe was implanted in the jugular vein and the kidney medulla, respectively; microdialysis samples were collected continuously, transferred to microtubes and analyzed by UPLC-Q-TOF/MS. The components in microdialysis samples were separated by an UPLC HSS T3 column and eluted with acetonitrile and water (containing 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The results showed that unbound constituents in blood circulation of the rat include hyperoside, isoquercitrin, quercetin monoglucuronide, quercetin-3'-O-glucoside, quercetin, myricetin, and hibifolin while unbound constituents in kidney are hyperoside, isoquercitrin, quercetin monoglucuronide, which might be the potential active components in vivo. The developed method was simple and reliable, and could be adopted to rapidly screen and identify potential active components contributing to pharmacological effects of TCM and to better clarify its action mechanism.	abelmoschus manihot isoquercitrin
1	[Effect of flavonoids from Abelmoschus manihot on proliferation, differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocyte and insulin resistance].Abelmoschus manihot was rich in flavonoids, which has been reported the activity on protecting angiocarpy and improving renal function. This study aimed to explore the action mechanism of five flavonoids from A. manihot on how to ameliorating insulin resistance through the regulation of the glucose and expression of PPARgamma, C/EBPalpha, SREBP-1, resistin, visfatin, adiponectin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. After the 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were differentiated into mature adipocytes, insulin resistance model was built. Insulin resistance adipocytes were treated with 5, 100 mumol L-1 quercetin, isoquercitrin, hyperoside, quercitrin-3'-O-glucoside, gossypetin-8-O-beta-glucoside. The glucose was indirectly determined by BCA kit. The mRNA expression levels of PPARgamma, C/EBPalpha, SREBP-1, resistin, visfatin, adiponectin were detected by real-time quantitative PCR. Results showed that five flavonoids at 5 mumol L-1 could accelerate preadipocytes proliferation and inhibit that at 100 mumol L-1 Compared with the normal group, glucose uptake reduced significantly in model group (P&lt;0.01). With the treatment of five flavonoids at 100 mumol L-1, glucose consumption increased significantly (P&lt;0.01). The high expression of PPARgamma, C/EBPalpha, adiponectin expression was significantly increased (P&lt;0.01), and low expression of SREBP-1, resistin, visfatin after respective administration with five flavonoids at 100 mumol L-1 promoted adipocyte differentiation. This study showed that, HY, JY, QT, QG, GG can control preadipocytes proliferation, promote adipocyte differentiation and regulate the expression of relative factors with lipid metabolism, such as PPARgamma, C/EBPalpha, SREBP-1, adiponectin, resistin, visfatin, increasing glucose utilization and improving insulin resistance in 3T3-L1 adipocyte.	a. manihot flavonoids
2	Zanthoxylum caribaeum (Rutaceae) essential oil: chemical investigation and biological effects on Rhodnius prolixus nymph.A chemical investigation and bioassays against fifth-instar nymphae of the hematophagous insect Rhodnius prolixus, vector of Chagas disease, were conducted with the essential oil from Zanthoxylum caribaeum. The main results may be summarized as follows: (i) 54 components were identified, corresponding to 90.4% of the relative composition; sesquiterpenes (47.3%) and monoterpenes (41.2%) are the major constituents; (ii) muurola-4,5-trans-diene and isodaucene are described for the first time as chemical constituents of the essential oil from leaves of this species; (iii) topical treatment with the crude essential oil induced high levels of paralysis (from 18.88 to 33.33%) and mortality (from 80 to 98.9%) depending on the dose applied (0.5 to 5.0 mul per insect); (iv) feeding treatment with the crude essential oil also induced high levels of mortality (from 48.8 to 100%) but low levels of paralysis (from 2.22 to 7.77%) depending on the dose applied (0.5 to 5.0 mul/ml of blood); (v) in the continuous treatment, only the dose of 5.0 mul/cm(2) was able to promote statistical significant levels of mortality (63.3%) but no paralysis were detected. However in this group, occasionally, only few insects displayed malformations of legs and wings after treatment; and (vi) any treatment was able to disrupt the metamorphosis process since the low adult stage emergence observed to all groups was due the high insect mortality. These observations suggest the interference of Z. caribaeum compounds on the triatomine neuroendocrine system. The significance of these results in relation to the relevant biological events in R. prolixus as well as the possible use of insect growth regulators present in Z. caribaeum oil in integrated vector control programs against hematophagous triatomine species is herein discussed.	r. prolixus chagas disease
1	Alkaloids from the roots of Zanthoxylum nitidum and their antiviral and antifungal effects.Five alkaloids, 5,6-dihydro-6-methoxynitidine (1), dictamnine (2), gamma-fagarine (3), skimmianine (4), and 5-methoxydictamnine (5), were isolated from the roots of Zanthoxylum nitidum. Their structures and configurations were elucidated by spectroscopic methods and X-ray analysis. Compounds 1, 4, and 5 showed in vitro antiviral effect against hepatitis B virus, and compounds 2, 3, and 5 demonstrated marked antimitotic and antifungal activity.	zanthoxylum nitidum dictamnine
2	A biophysical elucidation for less toxicity of agglutinin than abrin-a from the seeds of Abrus precatorius in consequence of crystal structure.X-ray crystal structure determination of agglutinin from Abrus precatorius in Taiwan is presented. The crystal structure of agglutinin, a type II ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP) from the seeds of Abrus precatorius in Taiwan, has been determined from a novel crystalline form by the molecular replacement method using the coordinates of abrin-a as the template. The structure has space group P4(1)2(1)2 with Z = 8, and been refined at 2.6 A to R-factor of 20.4%. The root-mean-square deviations of bond lengths and angles from the standard values are 0.009 A and 1.3 degrees. Primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures of agglutinin have been described and compared with those of abrin-a to a certain extent. In subsequent docking research, we found that Asn200 of abrin-a may form a critical hydrogen bond with G4323 of 28SRNA, while corresponding Pro199 of agglutinin is a kink hydrophobic residue bound with the cleft in a more compact complementary relationship. This may explain the lower toxicity of agglutinin than abrin-a, despite of similarity in secondary structure and the activity cleft of two RIPs.	abrus precatorius toxicity
3	Chromium and polyphenols from cinnamon improve insulin sensitivity.Naturally-occurring compounds that have been shown to improve insulin sensitivity include Cr and polyphenols found in cinnamon (Cinnamomon cassia). These compounds also have similar effects on insulin signalling and glucose control. The signs of Cr deficiency are similar to those for the metabolic syndrome and supplemental Cr has been shown to improve all these signs in human subjects. In a double-blind placebo-controlled study it has been demonstrated that glucose, insulin, cholesterol and HbA1c are all improved in patients with type 2 diabetes following Cr supplementation. It has also been shown that cinnamon polyphenols improve insulin sensitivity in in vitro, animal and human studies. Cinnamon reduces mean fasting serum glucose (18-29%), TAG (23-30%), total cholesterol (12-26%) and LDL-cholesterol (7-27%) in subjects with type 2 diabetes after 40 d of daily consumption of 1-6 g cinnamon. Subjects with the metabolic syndrome who consume an aqueous extract of cinnamon have been shown to have improved fasting blood glucose, systolic blood pressure, percentage body fat and increased lean body mass compared with the placebo group. Studies utilizing an aqueous extract of cinnamon, high in type A polyphenols, have also demonstrated improvements in fasting glucose, glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in women with insulin resistance associated with the polycystic ovary syndrome. For both supplemental Cr and cinnamon not all studies have reported beneficial effects and the responses are related to the duration of the study, form of Cr or cinnamon used and the extent of obesity and glucose intolerance of the subjects.

1	Polyphenolic content and antioxidant activity of an extractive fraction from Abies alba bark.UNLABELLED: The wood of mature Abies alba Mill. (silver fir) trees is used in construction and furniture industries, the bark being the main waste product. AIM: This study aimed to investigate possible therapeutic applications of Abies alba bark waste. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A raw extract and four extractive fractions were obtained from silver fir bark. They were also studied regarding their polyphenolic content (Folin-Ciocalteu assay). The ethyl acetate extractive fraction was further studied regarding its ability to scavenge free radicals (DPPH, superoxide anion and hydroxyl radicals) and to chelate ferrous ions. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The ethyl acetate fraction contained the highest amount of polyphenols (47.72 +/- 0.38 g gallic acid equivalents/100 g). Its DPPH scavenging and ferrous ions chelating abilities (EC50 = 7.9 +/- 0.1 and 1.56 +/- 0.05 microg/ml) were comparable to those of the positive controls, catechin (EC50 = 7.10 +/- 0.05 microg/ml) and EDTA-Na2 (EC50 = 1.27 +/- 0.01 microg/ml), respectively. It also scavenged superoxide anion and hydroxyl radicals with EC50 values of 53.30 +/- 5.91 and 63.12 +/- 1.78 microg/ml, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The ability of the ethyl acetate fraction to scavenge free radicals and chelate ferrous ions justifies further studies on the possible therapeutic applications of its antioxidant potential.	silver fir gallic acid
3	Immunosuppressive Effects of A-Type Procyanidin Oligomers from Cinnamomum tamala.Cinnamon barks extracts have been reported to regulate immune function; however, the component(s) in cinnamon barks responsible for this effect is/are not yet clear. The aim of this study is to find out the possible component(s) that can be used as therapeutic agents for immune-related diseases from cinnamon bark. In this study, the immunosuppressive effects of fraction (named CT-F) and five procyanidin oligomers compounds, cinnamtannin B1, cinnamtannin D1 (CTD-1), parameritannin A1, procyanidin B2, and procyanidin C1, from Cinnamomum tamala or Cinnamomum cassia bark were examined on splenocytes proliferation model induced by ConA or LPS. Then, the effects of activated compound CTD-1 on cytokine production and 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) induced delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response were detected to evaluate the immunosuppressive activity of CTD-1. It was found that CT-F and CTD-1 significantly inhibited the splenocyte proliferation induced by ConA or LPS. CTD-1 dose-dependently reduced the level of IFN-gamma and IL-2 and intensively suppressed DNFB-induced DTH responses. These findings suggest that the immunosuppressive activities of cinnamon bark are in part due to procyanidin oligomers. CTD-1 may be a potential therapeutic agent for immune-related diseases. 	cinnamic aldehyde depression
1	Green and Efficient Processing of Cinnamomum cassia Bark by Using Ionic Liquids: Extraction of Essential Oil and Construction of UV-Resistant Composite Films from Residual Biomass.There is significant interest in the development of a sustainable and integrated process for the extraction of essential oils and separation of biopolymers by using novel and efficient solvent systems. Herein, cassia essential oil enriched in coumarin is extracted from Cinnamomum cassia bark by using a protic ionic liquid (IL), ethylammonium nitrate (EAN), through dissolution and the creation of a biphasic system with the help of diethyl ether. The process has been perfected, in terms of higher biomass dissolution ability and essential oil yield through the addition of aprotic ILs (based on the 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium (C4 mim) cation and chloride or acetate anions) to EAN. After extraction of oil, cellulose-rich material and free lignin were regenerated from biomass-IL solutions by using a 1:1 mixture of acetone-water. The purity of the extracted essential oil and biopolymers were ascertained by means of FTIR spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, and GC-MS techniques. Because lignin contains UV-blocking chromophores, the oil-free residual lignocellulosic material has been directly utilized to construct UV-light-resistant composite materials in conjunction with the biopolymer chitosan. Composite material thus obtained was processed to form biodegradable films, which were characterized for mechanical and optical properties. The films showed excellent UV-light resistance and mechanical properties, thereby making it a material suitable for packaging and light-sensitive applications.	cinnamomum cassia essential oil
2	Phytotherapy against insomnia: extravagant claims or an alternative medicine?Insomnia or sleeplessness is a disorder characterized by a personal incapability to falling or staying asleep for a desirable period of time. Apart from Valeriana officinalis and Ziziphus jujuba most of the ethnobotanicals used for sleep disorders have not been evaluated for pharmacological or clinical efficacy against insomnia. Chinese herbal medicines involving polyherbal formulations are yet to be characterized and long-term side effects are yet to be evaluated. Anti insomniac phytotherapy opens up an exciting aspect of research which might benefit a large number of patients suffering from different degrees of insomnia.	ziziphus jujuba insomnia
2	Inhibitory effect of Zanthoxylum bungeanum essential oil (ZBEO) on Escherichia coli and intestinal dysfunction.The inhibitory effects of Zanthoxylum bungeanum essential oil (ZBEO) on Escherichia coli (E. coli) in vitro and in vivo were investigated, as well as its function of improvement of intestinal health. The results of in vitro studies, such as minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) analysis, agar disc diffusion test and growth curve analysis of E. coli, showed that ZBEO had an excellent inhibitory effect on the growth of E. coli, which may be related to the loss of the normal shape of the cell membranes and the leakage of intracellular constituents, on the basis of SEM observation and cell constituents' release assay. ZBEO also had an inhibitory effect on enteritis and intestinal dysfunction induced by infection of E. coli in vivo, and histopathological observation indicated that ZBEO could markedly ameliorate the structural destruction of intestinal tissues, which might be related to its inhibitory effect on the gene expression of inflammatory cytokines (TLR2, TLR4, TNFalpha and IL-8). In conclusion, ZBEO showed an excellent inhibitory effect on E. coli both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting the potential application of ZBEO as a kind of functional component having the effects of improving intestinal function and health.	zanthoxylum bungeanum intestinal dysfunction
4	Inhibition of Akt/mTOR/p70S6K Signaling Activity With Huangkui Capsule Alleviates the Early Glomerular Pathological Changes in Diabetic Nephropathy.Huangkui capsule (HKC), a Chinese modern patent medicine extracted from Abelmoschus manihot (L.) medic, has been widely applied to clinical therapy in the early diabetic nephropathy (DN) patients. However, it remains elusive whether HKC can ameliorate the inchoate glomerular injuries in hyperglycemia. Recently the activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/serine-threonine kinase (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and its downstream regulator, 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K), play important roles in the early glomerular pathological changes of DN including glomerular hypertrophy, glomerular basement membrane (GBM) thickening and mild mesangial expansion. This study thereby aimed to clarify therapeutic effects of HKC during the initial phase of DN and its underlying mechanisms. Fifteen rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: the normal group, the model group and the HKC group. The early DN model rats were induced by unilateral nephrectomy combined with intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin, and administered with either HKC suspension or vehicle after modeling and for a period of 4 weeks. Changes in the incipient glomerular lesions-related parameters in urine and blood were analyzed. Kidneys were isolated for histomorphometry, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and Western blotting (WB) at sacrifice. In vitro, murine mesangial cells (MCs) were used to investigate inhibitory actions of hyperoside (HYP), a bioactive component of HKC, on cellular hypertrophy-associated signaling pathway by WB, compared with rapamycin (RAP). For the early DN model rats, HKC ameliorated micro-urinary albumin, body weight and serum albumin, but had no significant effects on renal function and liver enzymes; HKC improved renal shape, kidney weight and kidney hypertrophy index; HKC attenuated glomerular hypertrophy, GBM thickening and mild mesangial expansion; HKC inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR and p70S6K, and the protein over-expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 in kidneys. In vitro, the phosphorylation of PI3K, Akt, mTOR and p70S6K in MCs induced by high-glucose was abrogated by treatment of HYP or RAP. On the whole, this study further demonstrated HKC safely and efficiently alleviates the early glomerular pathological changes of DN, likely by inhibiting Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling activity in vivo and in vitro, and provided the first evidence that HKC directly contributes to the prevention of the early DN.	p70S6K diabetic nephropathy
1	Cinnamic acid, from the bark of Cinnamomum cassia, regulates glucose transport via activation of GLUT4 on L6 myotubes in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-independent manner.BACKGROUND: Cinnamomum cassia (Family: Lauraceae) is an Ayurvedic medicinal plant used traditionally for the treatment of a number of diseases, including diabetes. The hypoglycemic effect of this plant has been established in vivo. However, the effects of cinnamic acid, isolated from C. cassia, on the insulin signaling cascade in an in vitro model have not been elucidated. Hence, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the anti-diabetic effect of cinnamic acid on glucose transport by L6 myotubes. METHODS: The mechanism of action of cinnamic acid was determined using specific targets in the insulin signaling pathway, including protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) 1B, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) and the glucose transporter GLUT4. After differentiation of myoblast to myotubes, the cells were serum deprived for 5 h and then treated with 1 ng/mL cinnamic acid and 50 mumol/L rosiglitazone for 18 h and 100 nmol/L insulin for 20 min for gene expression studies. RESULTS: Expression of GLUT4 mRNA was increased following treatment of L6 myotubes with 1 ng/mL cinnamic acid. Furthermore, cinnamic acid inhibited PTP1B activity (by 96.5%), but had no significant effect on PI3-K activity. CONCLUSION: On the basis of the results of the present study, we postulate that cinnamic acid isolated from the hydro-alcoholic extract of Cinnamomum cassia activates glucose transport by a PI3-K-independent pathway. However, the detailed mechanism of action requires further analysis.	cinnamomum cassia cinnamic acid
1	Effects of Tapinanthus globiferus and Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides extracts on human leukocytes in vitro.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at investigating the genotoxicity and cytotoxicity effect of Tapinanthus globiferus and Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides to human leukocytes. In addition, the reductive potential and the chemical composition of the two plant extracts were also determined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human leukocytes were obtained from healthy volunteer donors. The genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of T. globiferus and Z. zanthoxyloides were assessed using the comet assay and trypan blue exclusion, respectively. The antioxidant activity of the plant extracts was evaluated by the reducing power assay. Furthermore, high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector was used to characterize and quantify the constituents of these plants. RESULTS: T. globiferus (10-150 microg/mL) was neither genotoxic nor cytotoxic at the concentrations tested, suggesting that it can be consumed safely at relatively high concentrations. However, Z. zanthoxyloides showed cytoxicity and genotoxicity to human leukocytes at the highest concentration tested (150 microg/mL). In addition, the total reducing power of T. globiferus was found higher than Z. zanthoxyloides in potassium ferricyanide reduction. Both plants extract contained flavonoids (rutin and quercetin) and phenolic acids (chlorogenic and caffeic). CONCLUSION: The results obtained support the fact that some caution should be paid regarding the dosage and the frequency of use of Z. zanthoxyloides extract.	z. zanthoxyloides rutin
2	Protective effect of pharmacological preconditioning of total flavones of abelmoschl manihot on cerebral ischemic reperfusion injury in rats.The present study was to investigate the effect of pharmacological preconditioning of total flavones of abelmoschl manihot (TFA) on cerebral ischemic reperfusion injury in rats. Rat cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury was induced by occluding the right middle cerebral artery (MCA). The infarct size was determined by staining with 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazalium chloride (TTC). The serum malonaldehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were measured by using spectrophotometry; Inducible NO synthase (iNOS) mRNA expression was detected by RT-PCR method. The percentage of cerebral infarction volume was 28.1 +/- 0.8 in the model group, while TFA or nimodipine (Nim) pretreatment 36 hours prior to the ischemic insult significantly decreased the infarction volume. Increases of serum LDH activity and MDA level were observed after ischemia/reperfusion, but these changes were inhibited in rats pretreated with either TFA (20, 40, 80, 160 mg/kg) or Nim, indicating a delayed protective effect of TFA preconditioning on cerebral ischemic reperfusion injury. In addition, the serum NO level and the cerebral iNOS mRNA were up-regulated, suggesting a possible mechanism for the protective effect of TFA pretreatment on cerebral ischemic reperfusion injury.	flavones ischemic reperfusion injury
2	Clinical effects of Zingiber cassumunar (Plai): A systematic review.Zingiber cassumunar Roxb. known locally as "Plai" in Thai, has been used for treating bruise, sprain and musculoskeletal pain. Several pre-clinical studies demonstrated the anti-inflammatory effect of Plai. However, current evidence of clinical effects of Plai is still unclear. This study aimed to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of Plai among all identified indications. Of the 808 articles identified by a systematic review, six studies were included. Four studies were randomized controlled trials, while two studies were quasi-experimental studies involving 178 patients in intervention group and 177 patients in control group. Duration of treatment ranged from 7days to 2 months. Our findings showed that 14% Plai cream had a strong trend of benefits in pain reduction for muscle pain and ankle sprain. However, evidence supporting the effects of Plai on acne vulgaris treatment and anti-histamine effect are still unclear.	zingiber cassumunar roxb muscle pain
1	Antibacterial Activities of Herbal Toothpastes Combined with Essential Oils against Streptococcus mutans.In recent years, people have become more conscious about the side-effects of fluoride toothpastes and herbal products have drawn attention as alternatives in the struggle against caries. Studies have focused on the benefits of essential oils obtained from herbs because of their antibacterial effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the antibacterial activity of Origanum dubium and Cinnamomum cassia oils combined with herbal toothpastes against Streptococcus mutans. The antibacterial activity of the test materials was determined using the agar well diffusion method before and after the addition of essential oils. We tested the efficacy of Splat Organic and Splat Biocalcium against S. mutans (12 mm and 11 mm, respectively) doubled in combination with Origanum dubium (23 mm for both toothpastes) and tripled with Cinnamomum cassia (38 mm and 36 mm, respectively). Jack N' Jill toothpaste, which did not initially show any antibacterial effect, exhibited the largest inhibition zones after the addition of the essential oils (38 mm for Origanum dubium and 39 mm for Cinnamomum cassia). The results of this study pointed out that herbal toothpastes exhibit statistically higher antibacterial activity against Streptococcus mutans (p &lt; 0.05) than their initial forms after the addition of essential oils.	cinnamomum cassia essential oils
1	A cytotoxic secocycloartenoid from Abies koreana.Two triterpenoids, 24-methylene-3,4-seco-cycloart-4(28)-en-3-oic acid (1) and 3-oxo-9beta-lanosta-7,22Z,24-trien-26,23-olide (6) were isolated from Abies koreana, together with beta-sitosterol (2), maltol (3), beta-sitosterol-O-beta-D-glucoside (4), and hexacosylferulate (5). The structures of the compounds were established based on the spectroscopic data. The cytotoxic activities of triterpenoids have been evaluated using the sulforhodamine B (SRB) method. Compound 1 showed moderate cytotoxicities against human lung carcinoma (A549), ovarian carcinoma (SK-OV-3), malignant melanoma (SK-MEL-2), and colon carcinoma (HCT-15) cell lines.	abies koreana secocycloartenoid
1	Comparison of flavonoids, phenolic acids, and antioxidant activity of explosion-puffed and sun-dried jujubes (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.).The goal of the present study was to investigate the effect of explosion puffing and sun-drying on individual phenolic acids in four forms (free, esters, glycosides, and insoluble-bound), flavonoids, total phenolic content (TPC), and their antioxidant activity on jujube samples. Phenolic compounds were identified and quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography. Antioxidant capacity of jujube samples was evaluated by 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical scavenging activity and total reducing power. The results showed that all samples significantly differed in their phenolic contents, phenolic acid and flavonoid composition, and antioxidant activities. The explosion-puffed jujubes had the highest total gallic, p-hydroxybenzoic, vanillic, p-coumaric, ferulic acids, and rutin contents. Also, explosion-puffed jujubes contained a higher level of total phenolics and antioxidant activity than their counterparts. Among phenolic acid fractions in four forms, each form of phenolic acids in explosion-puffed jujubes had the most abundant content, followed by fresh and sun-dried jujubes. The glycosided and insoluble-bound phenolic acid fractions for each sample represented the highest TPC and the strongest antioxidant activity. The results indicated explosion puffing was a good choice for jujube processing.	jujube flavonoid

This review illustrates the pharmacological prospective of cinnamon and its use in daily life. 	cinnamon cardiovascular-disease
1	Seasonal variation in the leaf essential oil composition of Zanthoxylum clava-herculis growing in Huntsville, Alabama.The seasonal variation in the chemical composition of the leaf essential oil of Zanthoxylum clava-herculis has been analyzed by GC-MS. Three individual trees were sampled four times during the course of the 2004 growing season. Notable differences were recorded in the essential oil yields from the three trees on the four collection dates; yields were highest in May and lowest in July. The leaf essential oils were made up of 25 components, largely menthane monoterpenoids, dominated by limonene (44-73%) and 1,8-cineole (16-43%), with lesser amounts of alpha-thujene, linalool, gamma-terpinene, and alpha-terpineol. The ratio of oxygenated monoterpenoids to monoterpene hydrocarbons generally increased during the season, largely reflected in the 1,8-cineole/limonene ratio.	zanthoxylum clava-herculis alpha-terpineol
1	Structure-activity relationship of benzophenanthridine alkaloids from Zanthoxylum rhoifolium having antimicrobial activity.Zanthoxylum rhoifolium (Rutaceae) is a plant alkaloid that grows in South America and has been used in Brazilian traditional medicine for the treatment of different health problems. The present study was designed to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the steam bark crude methanol extract, fractions, and pure alkaloids of Z. rhoifolium. Its stem bark extracts exhibited a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, ranging from 12.5 to 100 microg/mL using bioautography method, and from 125 to 500 microg/mL in the microdilution bioassay. From the dichloromethane basic fraction, three furoquinoline alkaloids (1-3), and nine benzophenanthridine alkaloids (4-12) were isolated and the antimicrobial activity of the benzophenanthridine alkaloids is discussed in terms of structure-activity relationships. The alkaloid with the widest spectrum of activity was chelerythrine (10), followed by avicine (12) and dihydrochelerythrine (4). The minimal inhibitory concentrations of chelerythrine, of 1.50 microg/mL for all bacteria tested, and between 3.12 and 6.25 microg/mL for the yeast tested, show this compound to be a more powerful antimicrobial agent when compared with the other active alkaloids isolated from Z. rhoifolium. To verify the potential importance of the methylenedioxy group (ring A) of these alkaloids, chelerythrine was selected to represent the remainder of the benzophenanthridine alkaloids isolated in this work and was subjected to a demethylation reaction giving derivative 14. Compared to chelerythrine, the derivative (14) was less active against the tested bacteria and fungi. Kinetic measurements of the bacteriolytic activities of chelerythrine against the bacteria Bacillus subtilis (Gram-positive) and Escherichia coli (Gram-negative) were determined by optical density based on real time assay, suggesting that its mechanism of action is not bacteriolytic. The present study did not detect hemolytic effects of chelerythrine on erythrocytes and found a protective effect considering the decrease in TBARS and AOPP (advanced oxidized protein products) levels when compared to the control group. 	z. rhoifolium alkaloids
1	Pharmacognostic study and development of quality control parameters for fruit, bark and leaf of Zanthoxylum armatum (Rutaceae).CONTEXT: Zanthoxylum armatum (Rutaceae) fruit, bark and leaves are used for various conditions of ailments in traditional systems of medicine since ancient times. AIMS: This study is designed to lay down the various pharmacognostic and phytochemical standards which will be helpful to ensure the purity, safety, and efficacy of this medicinal plant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Various methods including macroscopic, microscopic, physicochemical, and phytochemical methods were applied to determine the diagnostic features for the identification and standardization of intact and powdered drug of Z. armatum leaf, fruit, and bark. RESULTS: The shape, size, color, odor, surface characteristics were determined for the intact drug and powdered materials of leaf, bark and fruit of Z. armatum. Light and electron microscope images of cross-section of leaf and powdered microscopy revealed useful diagnostic features. Histochemical, phytochemical, physicochemical including fluorescence analysis of powdered drug proved useful to differentiate the powdered drug material. High performance liquid chromatography analysis showed the presence of important phytoconstituents such as gallic acid and rutin. CONCLUSION: The data generated from this study would be of help in the authentication of various parts of Z. armatum, an important constituent of various herbal drug formulations. The qualitative and quantitative microscopic features would prove useful for laying down pharmacopoeial standards. Morphology as well as various pharmacognostic aspects of different parts of the plant were studied and have been described here along with phytochemical, physicochemical studies, which will help in authentication and quality control.	z. armatum rutin
4	Isobutylhydroxyamides from the pericarp of Nepalese Zanthoxylum armatum inhibit NF1-defective tumor cell line growth.A neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-based bioassay-guided phytochemical investigation on Zanthoxylum armatum collected in Nepal led to the isolation of new timuramides A-D (1-4) and six known sanshools (5-10). The structures of all compounds were established by using modern spectroscopic techniques, including 1D and 2D NMR analysis and comparison with previously reported data. Most of the compounds inhibited growth of an Nf1- and p53-deficient mouse glioma cell line at noncytotoxic concentrations.	Nf1 neurofibromatosis
1	Anticonvulsant, antidepressant-like activity of Abelmoschus manihot ethanol extract and its potential active components in vivo.Depression is the most common psychiatric comorbidity in patients with epilepsy. Searching for antiepileptic (anticonvulsant) and antidepressant-like medicines from natural products is very important for the treatment of this disease. The flower of Abelmoschus manihot (Linn.) Medicus has been reported to have neuroprotective effect against cerebral ischemia injury. In order to further explore the activity of Abelmoschus manihot on the central nervous system, the anticonvulsant and antidepressant-like effects of Abelmoschus manihot ethanol extract (AMEE) as well as its potential active components in vivo was investigated in the present study. It was found that AMEE could protect mice against PTZ-induced clonic convulsions and mortality. AMEE could also decrease immobility time in the FST in mice. Furthermore, the potential active components of AMEE in rat brain were identified by ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometer (UPLC-MS). Five parent components including isoquercitrin, hyperoside, hibifolin, quercetin-3'-O-glucoside, quercetin and three metabolites were detected in rat brain after administration of AMEE. In conclusion, eight flavonoids were identified in rat brain after administration of AMEE; meanwhile, these flavonoids might represent the potential bioactive components of AMEE and contribute to its anticonvulsant and antidepressant-like activity in vivo.	abelmoschus manihot quercetin-3'-O-glucoside
2	ZPDC glycoprotein inhibits inflammation-related cytokine and protein via nuclear factor-kappa B in dextran sulfate sodium-stimulated ICR mouse.The purpose of this study is to investigate the anti-inflammatory potentials of a 24-kDa glycoprotein isolated from Zanthoxylum piperitum DC fruit (ZPDC glycoprotein) in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-stimulated ICR mouse colitis. ZPDC glycoprotein was administered to mice at 10 and 20 mg/kg for 7 days and then the mice were co-treated with 5% DSS for another 7 days in presence of ZPDC glycoprotein and killed on day 15. The results showed that ZPDC glycoprotein has inhibitory effects on levels of disease activity index and large intestine shortening in DSS-treated mice. In addition, ZPDC glycoprotein suppresses the formation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, production of inducible nitric oxide, and release of lactate dehydrogenase in DSS-treated mice plasma. Interestingly, we found that consumption of ZPDC glycoprotein (20 mg/kg) significantly inhibited the expressions of interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and cyclooxygenase-2 via modulation of transcriptional activity of nuclear factor-kappa B in DSS-treated mice colon. Collectively, these results suggest that ZPDC glycoprotein is useful for prevention of inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases.	zanthoxylum piperitum gastrointestinal diseases
1	Application of microdialysis for elucidating the existing form of hyperoside in rat brain: comparison between intragastric and intraperitoneal administration.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort) is an important anti-depressant herb used in clinic and commonly prescribed for mild depression. Hyperoside is one of the major components of H. perforatum and is also detected in many plant species such as Abelmoschus manihot, Black Currant, Rosa agrestis, Apocynum venetum and Nelumbo nucifera. AIM OF THE STUDY: As the hyperoside showed CNS (central nervous system) protective activity (e.g. anti-depressant-like effect), the possibility of hyperoside or its metabolites to reach CNS should be investigated. Moreover, the pharmacokinetics profile of hyperoside or its metabolites in rat brain should be studied for further elucidating the mechanism of hyperoside action on CNS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A simple method for simultaneous determination of unbound hyperoside and its metabolite 3'-O-methyl-hyperoside in rat brain was developed by using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) and microdialysis technique. This method was applied for pharmacokinetics study of hyperoside and 3'-O-methyl-hyperoside in rat brain after intragastric (i.g.) and intraperitoneally (i.p.) administration of hyperoside in vivo. RESULTS: Results showed that neither hyperoside nor its metabolites were detected in rat brain after i.g. administration but both compounds could be detected after i.p. administration. Considering the activity of hyperoside through both i.g. and i.p. administration, our results imply that the active components of hyperoside in vivo might be different. Therefore, further studies are needed to identify the active components of hyperoside in vivo through these two different routes. Moreover, non-oral administration route (e.g., i.p.) should be further investigated and be explored to obtain higher bioavailability and better activity for hyperoside. Our results also showed that the real existing form of hyperoside in rat brain were hyperoside and its methylated metabolite with maximum concentration to be 63.78 ng/mL and 24.66 ng/mL after 20mg/kg i.p. administration, respectively. Therefore, a more reasonable concentration of hyperoside should be considered in in vitro assay to reflect the real situation of hyperoside concentration in vivo. CONCLUSION: Due to the wide use of herbal remedies containing hyperoside, our investigation will contribute to further clarifying the action of this substance. Moreover, this method will be applied for clinical pharmacokinetics study of hyperoside and its metabolite as well as herbs that contain hyperoside.	h. perforatum hyperoside
4	Involvement of prohibitin upregulation in abrin-triggered apoptosis.Abrin (ABR), a protein purified from the seeds of Abrus precatorius, induces apoptosis in various types of cancer cells. However, the detailed mechanism remains largely uncharacterized. By using a cDNA microarray platform, we determined that prohibitin (PHB), a tumor suppressor protein, is significantly upregulated in ABR-triggered apoptosis. ABR-induced upregulation of PHB is mediated by the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) pathway, as demonstrated by chemical inhibitors. In addition, ABR significantly induced the expression of Bax as well as the activation of caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in Jurkat T cells, whereas the reduction of PHB by specific RNA interference delayed ABR-triggered apoptosis through the proapoptotic genes examined. Moreover, our results also indicated that nuclear translocation of the PHB-p53 complex may play a role in the transcription of Bax. Collectively, our data show that PHB plays a role in ABR-induced apoptosis, which may be helpful for the development of diagnostic or therapeutic agents.	PARP tumor
0	Combined treatment with Cinnamaldehyde and beta-TCP had an additive effect on bone formation and angiogenesis in critical size calvarial defect in ovariectomized rats.Accumulating evidence suggests that improvements in osteogenesis and angiogenesis play an important role in repairing osteoporotic bone defects. Cinnamomum cassia (C. cassia), a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, is reported to show anabolic effects on osteoblasts. However, whether C. cassia could actually repair bone defects in osteoporotic conditions remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of combined treatment with Cinnamaldehyde (main oil isolated from the C. cassia) and beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP) on bone formation and angiogenesis in critical size calvarial defects in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Using a previously established OVX model, 5 mm critical size calvarial defect was established in OVX rats. All OVX rats were then randomly divided into OVX group (OVX rats + empty defect), TCP group (OVX rats + beta-TCP), and CTCP group (Cinnamaldehyde 75 mg/kg/day for 12 weeks + beta-TCP). Twelve weeks after treatment, according to Micro-CT and HE staining, combination of Cinnamaldehyde and beta-TCP had an additive effect on bone regeneration compared with other groups (p &lt; 0.05). Based on dynamic fluorochrome-labelling analysis, Cinnamaldehyde+beta-TCP continuously promoted new bone mineralization compared with other groups at each time point (p &lt; 0.05). Microfil perfusion suggested that CTCP group showed more neovascularization compared with other groups (p &lt; 0.05). Immunohistochemical assay supported the findings that Cinnamaldehyde+beta-TCP enhanced expression of OCN, VEGF and CD31. The present study demonstrated that combined treatment with Cinnamaldehyde and beta-TCP promoted bone formation and angiogenesis in osteoporotic bone defects, which provides a promising new strategy for repairing bone defects in osteoporotic conditions.

3	Selection of Escherichia coli heat-labile toxin (LT) inhibitors using both the GM1-ELISA and the cAMP Vero cell assay.Weaned piglets are very susceptible to diarrhea caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli. In the past, various natural components were proposed to have beneficial effects by reducing the effects of diarrheal infectious diseases in humans and animals, and thus may represent an alternative for the use of (prophylactic) antibiotics. Alternatives may inactivate enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli heat-labile toxin (LT) by interfering with toxin binding to the cellular receptor GM1. In this study, various plants and other natural substances were tested for inhibitory properties, in the GM1 binding assay, and in the LT-induced cAMP production in Vero cells. The toxic dose of each compound was determined in a cell viability assay, and the highest nontoxic concentrations were used in the GM1 and cAMP assays. Results demonstrated that only d-(+)-galactose, lactose, N-acetyl-d-galactosamine, and two tea extracts were able to inhibit the binding of LT to its GM1 receptor. In the cAMP assay, only the two tea extracts showed inhibitory activity. This shows that d-(+)-galactose, lactose, and N-acetyl-d-galactosamine can indeed inhibit LT binding to GM1 based on structural homology with GM1 in the absence of living cells. However, in the cAMP assay, d-(+)-galactose, and lactose, N-acetyl-d-galactosamine are apparently metabolized to below their effective inhibitory concentration, likely predicting limited practical applicability in vivo. Both tea extracts maintained their activity in the presence of cells. The active compounds in both are probably polyphenols, which are not easily metabolized, and most likely work by aggregating the toxin. In conclusion, the combination of methods used here is a convenient and fast method for preselecting natural substances containing potentially toxin-binding compounds. Furthermore, if antidiarrhea activity is attributed to compounds found inactive here, their activity is unlikely based on interference with toxin binding.	polyphenols diarrhea
1	[Analysis of alkaloids in Zanthoxylum nitidum by HPLC-DAD/ESI-Q-TOF-MS].The alkaloids in Zanthoxylum nitidum were identified by HPLC-DAD/ESI-Q-TOF-MS. Separation was performed on a Hanbon C18 column with acetonitrile (with 0.1% formic acid) and water(with 0.1% formic acid) as mobile phase. Based on the high-resolution mass information, MS/MS fragmentation behaviors and chemical components from literatures, 48 components were identified or tentatively characterized including 6 new compounds. This work could be useful for the quality control and further studies of the plant.	zanthoxylum nitidum alkaloids
1	Ceylon cinnamon does not affect postprandial plasma glucose or insulin in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance.Previous studies on healthy subjects have shown that the intake of 6 g Cinnamomum cassia reduces postprandial glucose and that the intake of 3 g C. cassia reduces insulin response, without affecting postprandial glucose concentrations. Coumarin, which may damage the liver, is present in C. cassia, but not in Cinnamomum zeylanicum. The aim of the present study was to study the effect of C. zeylanicum on postprandial concentrations of plasma glucose, insulin, glycaemic index (GI) and insulinaemic index (GII) in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). A total of ten subjects with IGT were assessed in a crossover trial. A standard 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was administered together with placebo or C. zeylanicum capsules. Finger-prick capillary blood samples were taken for glucose measurements and venous blood for insulin measurements, before and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 min after the start of the OGTT. The ingestion of 6 g C. zeylanicum had no significant effect on glucose level, insulin response, GI or GII. Ingestion of C. zeylanicum does not affect postprandial plasma glucose or insulin levels in human subjects. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment in Europe has suggested the replacement of C. cassia by C. zeylanicum or the use of aqueous extracts of C. cassia to lower coumarin exposure. However, the positive effects seen with C. cassia in subjects with poor glycaemic control would then be lost.	c. zeylanicum coumarin
1	Apoptosis inducing activity of benzophenanthridine-type alkaloids and 2-arylbenzofuran neolignans in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells.Thirteen compounds belonging to different classes of alkaloids (1-9) and lignans (10-13), isolated from the methanol extract of roots of the African medicinal plant Zanthoxylum capense, were assayed for their ability as apoptosis inducers in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells. The cytotoxicity of these compounds was evaluated in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells by the MTS assay. Out of the tested compounds, three benzophenanthridine alkaloids (1, 4, and 7), a dibenzyl butyrolactone lignan (10), and two 2-arylbenzofuran neolignans (12 and 13) displayed significant cytotoxicity to HCT116 cells, confirmed by the Guava ViaCount viability assay. The selected compounds (1, 4, 7, 10, 12, and 13) were further tested for apoptosis induction activity in HCT116 cells, by evaluation of nuclear morphology following Hoechst staining, and by caspase-3 like activity assays. Morphologic evaluation of HCT116 nuclei following Hoechst staining and fluorescence microscopy revealed that compounds 1, 4, 7, 10, 12, and 13 induced apoptosis in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells, producing similar, or higher, apoptosis levels when compared with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), the cornerstone cytotoxic used in colon cancer treatment for several decades. In fact, HCT116 cells developed morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis, including chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation and formation of apoptotic bodies. Importantly, compounds 4 and 13 at 20 muM were the most promising in this study, inducing respectively ~11- and 7-fold increases in apoptotic cells as compared to vehicle control, whereas 5-FU increased apoptosis by ~2-fold. Apoptosis induction for compounds 4 and 13 was further confirmed by caspase-3-like activity assays, which showed respectively ~2- and 1.5-fold increases in caspase-3-like activity compared to vehicle control. These results suggested that specific benzophenanthridine alkaloids and 2-arylbenzofuran neolignans isolated from Zanthoxylum capense show strong anticancer activity in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells.	zanthoxylum capense 2-arylbenzofuran neolignans
1	In vitro activities of plant extracts on human Loa loa isolates and cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells.Loa loa, a filarial worm, can cause fatal encephalitis in humans. In an attempt to find alternatives to the standard treatments (ivermectin and diethylcarbamazine citrate), we tested 12 methanolic extracts of nine traditional plant remedies. The extracts (100-0.09 microg/ml) were incubated with 20 Loa loa microfilariae isolated from patients at 37 degrees C with 5% CO(2) in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal serum and antibiotics. Activity was evaluated 120 h later by counting live microfilariae under a microscope. Cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells was estimated by measuring 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2-5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide transformation to formazan at 450 nM in a spectrophotometer. The plants tested were Lophira alata, Greenwayodendron suaveolens, Uapaca togoensis, Zanthoxylum heitzii, Peperomia pellucida, Piptadeniastrum africanum, Petersianthus macrocarpus, Vernonia conferta, and Vernonia hymenolepis. Chemical screening showed that most of the extracts contained reducing sugars, tannin or polyphenols, sterols or triterpenes, saponosides, and alkaloids. None contained carotinoids and few contained flavonoids. The 50% lethal concentration ranged from 0.22 to 70.28 microg/ml, while the 50% inhibitory concentration for eukaryotic cells (IC(50)) ranged from 8.52 to 119.52 microg/ml. Extracts of P. macrocarpus (selectivity index = 72.16), P. africanum (13.69), Z. heitzii (12.11), and L. alata (9.26) were highly selective for L. loa.	p. macrocarpus triterpenes
4	Development and characterization of immobilized cannabinoid receptor (CB1/CB2) open tubular column for on-line screening.Cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, are therapeutic targets in the treatment of anxiety, obesity, movement disorders, glaucoma, and pain. We have developed an on-line screening method for CB1 and CB2 ligands, where cellular membrane fragments of a chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line, KU-812, were immobilized onto the surface of an open tubular (OT) capillary to create a CB1/CB2-OT column. The binding activities of the immobilized CB1/CB2 receptors were established using frontal affinity chromatographic techniques. This is the first report that confirms the presence of functional CB1 and CB2 receptors on KU-812 cells. The data from this study confirm that the CB1/CB2-OT column can be used to determine the binding affinities (K(i) values) for a single compound and to screen individual compounds or a mixture of multiple compounds. The CB1/CB2-OT column was also used to screen a botanical matrix, Zanthoxylum clava-herculis, where preliminary results suggest the presence of a high-affinity phytocannabinoid.	CB1 anxiety
1	Identification of the potential active components of Abelmoschus manihot in rat blood and kidney tissue by microdialysis combined with ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry.In this paper, microdialysis combining with ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) was applied to simultaneously identify components in blood and kidney dialysis after oral administration of Abelmoschus manihot extract. Microdialysis probe was implanted in the jugular vein and the kidney medulla, respectively; microdialysis samples were collected continuously, transferred to microtubes and analyzed by UPLC-Q-TOF/MS. The components in microdialysis samples were separated by an UPLC HSS T3 column and eluted with acetonitrile and water (containing 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The results showed that unbound constituents in blood circulation of the rat include hyperoside, isoquercitrin, quercetin monoglucuronide, quercetin-3'-O-glucoside, quercetin, myricetin, and hibifolin while unbound constituents in kidney are hyperoside, isoquercitrin, quercetin monoglucuronide, which might be the potential active components in vivo. The developed method was simple and reliable, and could be adopted to rapidly screen and identify potential active components contributing to pharmacological effects of TCM and to better clarify its action mechanism.	abelmoschus manihot acetonitrile
2	From type 2 diabetes to antioxidant activity: a systematic review of the safety and efficacy of common and cassia cinnamon bark.Common (Cinnamomum verum, C. zeylanicum) and cassia (C. aromaticum) cinnamon have a long history of use as spices and flavouring agents. A number of pharmacological and clinical effects have been observed with their use. The objective of this study was to systematically review the scientific literature for preclinical and clinical evidence of safety, efficacy, and pharmacological activity of common and cassia cinnamon. Using the principles of evidence-based practice, we searched 9 electronic databases and compiled data according to the grade of evidence found. One pharmacological study on antioxidant activity and 7 clinical studies on various medical conditions were reported in the scientific literature including type 2 diabetes (3), Helicobacter pylori infection (1), activation of olfactory cortex of the brain (1), oral candidiasis in HIV (1), and chronic salmonellosis (1). Two of 3 randomized clinical trials on type 2 diabetes provided strong scientific evidence that cassia cinnamon demonstrates a therapeutic effect in reducing fasting blood glucose by 10.3%-29%; the third clinical trial did not observe this effect. Cassia cinnamon, however, did not have an effect at lowering glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c). One randomized clinical trial reported that cassia cinnamon lowered total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides; the other 2 trials, however, did not observe this effect. There was good scientific evidence that a species of cinnamon was not effective at eradicating H. pylori infection. Common cinnamon showed weak to very weak evidence of efficacy in treating oral candidiasis in HIV patients and chronic salmonellosis.	cinnamon oral candidiasis
2	Abrin poisoning.Abrin is a toxic protein obtained from the seeds of Abrus precatorius (jequirity bean), which is similar in structure and properties to ricin. Abrin is highly toxic, with an estimated human fatal dose of 0.1-1 microgram/kg, and has caused death after accidental and intentional poisoning. Abrin can be extracted from jequirity beans using a relatively simple and cheap procedure. This satisfies one criterion of a potential chemical warfare agent, although the lack of large scale production of jequirity seeds means that quantity is unavailable for ready mass production of abrin for weapons. This contrasts with the huge cultivation of Ricinus seeds for castor oil production. At the cellular level, abrin inhibits protein synthesis, thereby causing cell death. Many of the features observed in abrin poisoning can be explained by abrin-induced endothelial cell damage, which causes an increase in capillary permeability with consequent fluid and protein leakage and tissue oedema (the so-called vascular leak syndrome). Most reported cases of human poisoning involve the ingestion of jequirity beans, which predominantly cause gastrointestinal toxicity. Management is symptomatic and supportive. Experimental studies have shown that vaccination with abrin toxoid may offer some protection against a subsequent abrin challenge, although such an approach is unlikely to be of benefit in a civilian population that in all probability would be unprotected.	abrus precatorius poisoning
2	In vitro anti-Helicobacter pylori action of 30 Chinese herbal medicines used to treat ulcer diseases.Infection by Helicobacter pylori has been ascertained to be an important etiologic impetus leading usually to chronic active gastritis and gastric ulcer with growing incidences worldwide. Utilizing as the test pathogen a standard and five clinic strains of Helicobacter pylori, the antibacterial action was assessed in vitro with ethanol extracts of 30 Chinese herbal medicines which have been frequently prescribed since ancient times for treating gastritis-like disorders. Among the 30 tested materials, the ethanol extracts of Abrus cantoniensis (Fabaceae), Saussurea lappa (Asteraceae) and Eugenia caryophyllata (Myrtaceae) were strongly inhibitory to all test strains (MICs: approximately 40 microg/ml), and Hippophae rhamnoides (Elaeagnaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii (Liliaceae), Magnolia officinalis and Schisandra chinensis (Magnoliaceae), Corydalis yanhusuo (Papaveraceae), Citrus reticulata (Rutaceae), Bupleurum chinense and Ligusticum chuanxiong (Apiaceae) substantially active with MICs close to 60.0 microg/ml. As to antibacterial actions of the aqueous extracts of the same drugs, those derived from Cassia obtusifolia (Fabaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii and Eugenia caryophyllata were remarkably inhibitory against all the six Helicobacter pylori strains (MICs: approximately 60 microg/ml). The work compared almost quantitatively the magnitude of the anti-Helicobacter pylori actions of the 30 most prescribed gastritis-treating Chinese herbal drugs, and located as well some source plants where potent anti-Helicobacter pylori phytochemicals could be characterized.	saussurea lappa gastritis
1	Nrf2-dependent suppression of azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium-induced colon carcinogenesis by the cinnamon-derived dietary factor cinnamaldehyde.The progressive nature of colorectal cancer and poor prognosis associated with the metastatic phase of the disease create an urgent need for the development of more efficacious strategies targeting colorectal carcinogenesis. Cumulative evidence suggests that the redox-sensitive transcription factor Nrf2 (nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2), a master regulator of the cellular antioxidant defence, represents a promising molecular target for colorectal cancer chemoprevention. Recently, we have identified cinnamon, the ground bark of Cinnamomum aromaticum (cassia cinnamon) and Cinnamomum verum (Ceylon cinnamon), as a rich dietary source of the Nrf2 inducer cinnamaldehyde (CA) eliciting the Nrf2-regulated antioxidant response in human epithelial colon cells, conferring cytoprotection against electrophilic and genotoxic insult. Here, we have explored the molecular mechanism underlying CA-induced Nrf2 activation in colorectal epithelial cells and have examined the chemopreventive potential of CA in a murine colorectal cancer model comparing Nrf2(+/+) with Nrf2(-/-) mice. In HCT116 cells, CA caused a Keap1-C151-dependent increase in Nrf2 protein half-life via blockage of ubiquitination with upregulation of cytoprotective Nrf2 target genes and elevation of cellular glutathione. After optimizing colorectal Nrf2 activation and target gene expression by dietary CA-supplementation regimens, we demonstrated that CA suppresses AOM/DSS-induced inflammatory colon carcinogenesis with modulation of molecular markers of colorectal carcinogenesis. Dietary suppression of colorectal cancer using CA supplementation was achieved in Nrf2(+/+) but not in Nrf2(-/-) mice confirming the Nrf2 dependence of CA-induced chemopreventive effects. Taken together, our data suggest feasibility of colorectal cancer suppression by dietary CA, an FDA-approved food additive derived from the third most consumed spice in the world.	ceylon cinnamon cinnamaldehyde
3	Antitumor activity of 2-hydroxycinnamaldehyde for human colon cancer cells through suppression of beta-catenin signaling.The antiproliferative and antitumor activities of 2-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (1), a phenylpropanoid isolated from the bark of Cinnamomum cassia, were investigated using human colorectal cancer cells. Compound 1 exhibited antiproliferative effects in HCT116 colon cancer cells, accompanied by modulation of the Wnt/beta-catenin cell signaling pathway. This substance was found also to inhibit beta-catenin/T-cell factor (TCF) transcriptional activity in HEK293 cells and HCT116 colon cancer cells. Further mechanistic investigations in human colon cancer cells with aberrantly activated Wnt/beta-catenin signaling showed that 1 significantly suppressed the binding of beta-catenin/TCF complexes to their specific genomic targets in the nucleus and led to the down-regulation of Wnt target genes such as c-myc and cyclin D1. In an in vivo xenograft model, the intraperitoneal administration of 1 (10 or 20 mg/kg body weight, three times/week) for four weeks suppressed tumor growth in athymic nude mice implanted with HCT116 colon cancer cells significantly, without any apparent toxicity. In an ex vivo biochemical analysis of the tumors, compound 1 was also found to suppress Wnt target genes associated with tumor growth including beta-catenin, c-myc, cyclin D1, and survivin. The suppression of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway is a plausible mechanism of action underlying the antiproliferative and antitumor activity of 1 in human colorectal cancer cells. 	2-hydroxycinnamaldehyde colorectal cancer
2	Antimicrobial effect of extracts from Chinese chive, cinnamon, and corni fructus.Extracts were prepared from Chinese chive (Allium tuberosum), cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia), and corni fructus (Cornus officinalis) and used to evaluate their antimicrobial activity on common foodborne microorganisms, alone and in combination. The mixed extract, consisting of three extracts in equal volumes, showed an entire antimicrobial spectrum and had excellent stability to heat, pH, and storage. The mixed extract exhibited better inhibition on growth of Escherichia coli than potassium sorbate at 2-5 mg/mL. The mixed extract inhibited the growth of Pichia membranaefaciens at levels as low as 2 mg/mL. When the mixed extract was used in foods, the expected antimicrobial effect in orange juice, pork, and milk was observed. After gel filtration chromatography, each extract was partially purified into fractions, and one fraction in each extract showed enhanced antimicrobial activity. Overall, the mixed extract was of promising potential for incorporation into various food products for which a natural antimicrobial additive is desired.	cornus officinalis antimicrobial activity
1	[Particularities of corrective action of polar lipids and bioantioxidants from sea hydrobionts at imbalances of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism].A total mixture of phospho- and glycolipids from sea macrophytes Sargassum pallidum, Ulva fenestrata, Zostera marina was separated and the fatty acid composition was determined. Biological activity of the mixtures of polar lipids and natural antioxidants echinochrome A from flat sea urchin Scaphechinus mirabilis and polyphenolic complex from sea grass Zostera marina was studied in rats with experimental model of atherosclerosis and diabetes. These experiments revealed optimal compositions for mixtures of polar lipids and antioxidants, which possess high medical-corrective activity. Proposed mechanisms of action of the polar lipids (containing different polyunsaturated fatty acids) and antioxidants studied are presented. These compositions may be used for creation of new biologically-active additives and drugs.	zostera marina lipids
3	A novel drug candidate for Alzheimer's disease treatment: gx-50 derived from Zanthoxylum bungeanum.This study focused on a promising drug candidate, N-[2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethyl]-3-phenyl-acrylamide (gx-50), a compound extracted from Sichuan pepper (Zanthoxylum Bungeanum), to determine whether it would be an effective therapeutic for Alzheimer's disease (AD) via biological experiments. In vivo, we determined the pharmacokinetic profile of gx-50 and evaluated the effect of gx-50 on the cognitive abilities of amyloid-beta protein precursor transgenic (AbetaPP-Tg) mice by Morris water maze testing. In addition, we examined the effects of gx-50 on amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers in the brains of AbetaPP-Tg mice by immunohistochemistry. In vitro, we observed a direct effect of gx-50 on Abeta oligomers by atomic force microscopy, detected the neuroprotective effects of gx-50 by western blotting and cell apoptosis assays, and measured its effects on intracellular calcium currents by laser confocal microscopy. Experiments in vivo showed that gx-50 could penetrate the blood brain barrier and improve the cognitive abilities of mice. Moreover, gx-50 treatment decreased the accumulation of Abeta oligomers in the cerebral cortex. The results in vitro demonstrated that gx-50 could disassemble Abeta oligomers, inhibit Abeta-induced neuronal apoptosis and apoptotic gene expression, and reduce neuronal calcium toxicity. These results strongly suggest that gx-50 is a potential candidate drug for treating AD.	N-[2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethyl]-3-phenyl-acrylamide AD
1	Phytochemical analyses of Ziziphus jujuba Mill. var. spinosa seed by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.Ziziphus jujuba Mill. var. spinosa (Z. jujuba) seeds have attracted much attention within the field of medicine due to their significant effects against disturbances of the central nervous system. Secondary metabolites composition is key to the influence of the pharmaceutical and commercial qualities of this plant. In this work, the phytochemical profile of Z. jujuba seeds was analysed by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The UPLC-MS/MS information identified the main secondary metabolites in Z. jujuba seeds, including flavonoid C-glycosides, triterpene acids and unsaturated fatty acids. The leading chemical identified by UPLC-MS/MS was betulinic acid, and oleic acid was the leading volatile from the GC-MS results. All the samples tested showed similar phytochemical profiles, but levels of the chemical compounds varied. Principal component analysis revealed the principal secondary metabolites that could define the differences in quality. It was confirmed that the combination of UPLC-MS/MS and GC-MS was an effective technique to demonstrate the pharmaceutical quality of Z. jujuba seeds. 	z. jujuba oleic acid
2	Plant toxin abrin induced oxidative stress mediated neurodegenerative changes in mice.Abrin is a potent plant toxin. It is a heterodimeric protein toxin which is obtained from the seeds of Abrus precatorius plant. At cellular level abrin causes protein synthesis inhibition by removing the specific adenine residue (A4324) from the 28s rRNA of the 60S - ribosomal subunit. In the present study we investigated the role of oxidative stress in neurotoxic potential and demyelinating effects of abrin on brain. The mechanism by which abrin induces oxidative damage and toxicity in brain are relatively unknown. Animals were exposed to 0.4 and 1.0 LD50 abrin dose by intraperitoneal route and observed for 1 and 3 day post-toxin exposure. Oxidative stress occurred in brain due to abrin was confirmed in terms of increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathione depletion and increased lipid peroxidation. Significant increase in blood and brain ROS was observed at day 3, 1 LD50. Abrin induced changes in the neurotransmitters (5-hydroxy tryptamine, norepinephrine, dopamine and monoamine oxidase) levels were evaluated by spectroflourometry. Increase in the levels of 5-HT and NE was observed after abrin exposure. MAO activity was found to be decreased in abrin exposed animals compared to control. Significant inhibition in the activity of acetylcholine esterase enzyme in brain and serum was reported for both the doses and time points. Western blot analysis of iNOS expression indicated that abrin treatment resulted in dose and time dependent increase. Furthermore, protein expression of myelin basic protein (MBP) was down regulated in a dose and time dependent manner. Brain histopathology was carried out and cortical brain region showed demyelination after abrin exposure. Results confirmed that abrin poisoning leads to neurodegeneration and neurotoxicity mediated through oxidative stress, AChE inhibition, lipid peroxidation and decrease in MBP levels. 	abrus precatorius neurodegeneration and neurotoxicity
2	In vivo antitrypanosomal effects of some ethnomedicinal plants from Nupeland of north central Nigeria.Four medicinal plants Acacia nilotica, Bombax buonopozense, Terminalia avicennioides and Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides traditionally used for treatment of sleeping sickness in Nupeland were investigated for in vivo antitrypanosomal activity. Methanol extracts of different parts of each plant (stem barks and fruits) were obtained and evaluated for their in vivo antitrypanosomal activities against Trypanosoma brucei brucei. Phytochemical screening of the methanol extracts of each plant were performed by standard procedures. Methanol extracts of A. nilotica (stem bark), B. buonopozense (stem bark), T. avicennioides (round fruit) and Z. zanthoxyloides (stem bark) were effective on trypanosomes. The extracts of A. nilotica and B. buonopozense exhibited antitrypanosomal effects at 200 and 300 mg/kg body weight respectively. Doses were able to clear the parasites from circulation within 6 and 7 days of treatment respectively with prolonging survival period of up to 30 days. While the extracts of T. avicennioides and Z. zanthoxyloides showed trypanostatic effects and could not clear the parasites completely. The methanol extracts of these plants contain metabolites that are associated with antitrypanosomal effects; therefore, these medicinal plants may be sources of new compounds that may be active against T. b. brucei. This study has also justified the claim that some medicinal plants of Nupeland possess antitrypanosomal activity and could be useful in the management of trypanosomiasis.	a. nilotica trypanosomiasis
1	UHPLC-TOFMS coupled with chemometric method as a powerful technique for rapid exploring of differentiating components between two Ziziphus species.To rapidly explore the differentiating components and the potential chemical markers for discrimination between those Chinese medicinal herbs with similar chemical characteristics, an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-TOFMS coupled with multivariate statistical analysis method was proposed and validated by using two Ziziphus species (Z. jujuba and Z. jujuba var. spinosa) as the model herbs. After the samples were analyzed using UHPLC-TOFMS, the data sets of retention time (RT)-m/z pairs, ion intensities and sample codes were further processed with orthogonal partial least squared discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) to holistically compare the difference between the fruits of these two Ziziphus species, and to generate an S-plot. Those compounds correlating to the points at the two ends of "S" were regarded as the most differentiating components between these two kinds of samples. By comparing the mass/UV spectra and retention times with those of reference compounds, these components were finally characterized as zizyberenalic acid, palmitoleic acid, oleic acid, pomonic acid and rutin, and these compounds would be the potential chemical markers for discrimination of these jujube products. The results suggested that this newly established approach could be used to rapidly determine the subtle differences and explore the potential chemical markers for differentiation within the herbs with similar chemical ingredients.	jujube palmitoleic acid
1	Polyphenolic content and antioxidant activity of an extractive fraction from Abies alba bark.UNLABELLED: The wood of mature Abies alba Mill. (silver fir) trees is used in construction and furniture industries, the bark being the main waste product. AIM: This study aimed to investigate possible therapeutic applications of Abies alba bark waste. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A raw extract and four extractive fractions were obtained from silver fir bark. They were also studied regarding their polyphenolic content (Folin-Ciocalteu assay). The ethyl acetate extractive fraction was further studied regarding its ability to scavenge free radicals (DPPH, superoxide anion and hydroxyl radicals) and to chelate ferrous ions. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The ethyl acetate fraction contained the highest amount of polyphenols (47.72 +/- 0.38 g gallic acid equivalents/100 g). Its DPPH scavenging and ferrous ions chelating abilities (EC50 = 7.9 +/- 0.1 and 1.56 +/- 0.05 microg/ml) were comparable to those of the positive controls, catechin (EC50 = 7.10 +/- 0.05 microg/ml) and EDTA-Na2 (EC50 = 1.27 +/- 0.01 microg/ml), respectively. It also scavenged superoxide anion and hydroxyl radicals with EC50 values of 53.30 +/- 5.91 and 63.12 +/- 1.78 microg/ml, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The ability of the ethyl acetate fraction to scavenge free radicals and chelate ferrous ions justifies further studies on the possible therapeutic applications of its antioxidant potential.	silver fir polyphenols
1	Safety assessment of Zanthoxylum alatum Roxb. essential oil, its antifungal, antiaflatoxin, antioxidant activity and efficacy as antimicrobial in preservation of Piper nigrum L. fruits.The investigation deals with antifungal, antiaflatoxin and antioxidant efficacy of Zanthoxylum alatum Roxb. essential oil (EO), its two major constituents and their comparison with five commonly used organic acid preservatives. The chemical profile of EO, characterized through GC and GC-MS analysis, revealed linalool (56.10%) and methyl cinnamate (19.73%) as major components. The EO, linalool and methyl cinnamate completely inhibited the growth of a toxigenic strain of A. flavus (LHP-10) as well as aflatoxin B(1) secretion at different concentrations. Methyl cinnamate was found to be more efficacious than EO, linalool and five organic acid preservatives, showing antifungal and antiaflatoxigenic efficacy at a low concentration (0.6 mul/ml) and the nature of its toxicity was fungicidal. However, EO showed strong antioxidant activity with an IC(50) value at 5.6 mul/ml. Moreover, EO was found to have negligible mammalian toxicity as its LD(50) value, determined through oral administration on mice, was calculated to be 6124mul/kg body weight during safety profile assessment. During in vivo investigation on fruit systems, the Zanthoxylum EO, when tested as fumigant, provided 66.27% and 86.33% protection respectively at 1.25 mul/ml and 2.5 mul/ml against fungi infesting Piper nigrum L. fruits demonstrating its practical efficacy as a plant based antimicrobial for post harvest application.	piper nigrum l methyl cinnamate
1	Microwave-assisted extraction of jujube polysaccharide: Optimization, purification and functional characterization.The operational parameters involved in microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) of jujube polysaccharide including microwave power, water to raw material ratio and extraction temperature and time were optimized by RSM. MAE at 400W, 75 C, 60 min, using 30 g water/g powdered jujube was the best condition for maximum yield (9.02%) of polysaccharide. Two novel water-soluble polysaccharides (JCP-1 and JCP-2) with average molecular weights of 9.1x10(4)-1.5x10(5)Da in term of the symmetrical narrow peaks were identified using the analytical purification procedures. The JCP-1 and JCP-2 mainly composed of glucose, arabinose, galactose and rhamnose in molar ratios of 1.4:2.1:4.2:0.9 and 1.2:1.8:4.1:1.1, respectively. The use of 1.5% JCP-1 led to a high emulsifying stability (95.5%) in a model oil-in-water type emulsion with a reduced surface tension (44.1 mN/m) and droplet size (1.32 mum), and an increased apparent viscosity (0.13 Pas) during 21-day cold storage. The antioxidant activities were increased in dose-dependent manners (25-200 mug/mL).	jujube glucose
1	Zizimauritic acids A-C, three novel nortriterpenes from Ziziphus mauritiana.Zizimauritic acids A-C (1-3), three novel nortriterpenes with a unique A-nor-E-seco spiro-lactone ceanothane-type triterpene skeleton, together with 3 known triterpenes ceanothenic acid (4), betulinic acid (5), and ceanothic acid (6), were isolated from the roots of Ziziphus mauritiana. Compounds 1-4 showed cytotoxicities with the IC(50) values ranging from 5.05 to 11.94 mug/ml, and compounds 1 and 3 showed an inhibitory effect on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus with the IC(50) values 2.17 and 12.79 mug/ml. A plausible biosynthetic pathway of compounds 1-3 was proposed.	ziziphus mauritiana ceanothic acid
1	Kaikasaponin III and soyasaponin I, major triterpene saponins of Abrus cantoniensis, act on GOT and GPT: influence on transaminase elevation of rat liver cells concomitantly exposed to CCl4 for one hour.The antihepatotoxic activities of soyasaponin I and kaikasaponin III, triterpenoidal saponins isolated from Abri Herba, the whole plant of Abrus cantoniensis, were studied on liver injury induced by CCl4 in primary cultured rat hepatocytes. The antihepatotoxic activities of these saponins and glycyrrhizin (positive control) were demonstrated by measuring the levels of glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT) and glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT). Soyasaponin I inhibited the elevation of GOT and GPT activities. The activities were comparable to those of glycyrrhizin. On the other hand, kaikasaponin III was more effective than soyasaponin I and glycyrrhizin. Kaikasaponin III showed the antihepatotoxic activity at less than 100 micrograms/ml. Furthermore, the highest activity was observed even in the lower doses (50, 100 micrograms/ml). However, soyasaponin I and kaikasaponin III showed some toxicity at the highest dose (500 micrograms/ml), though glycyrrhizin did not show toxicity at any dose.	abrus cantoniensis kaikasaponin iii
2	HPLC method for measurement of human salivary alpha-amylase inhibition by aqueous plant extracts.Control of hyperglycemia is an important treatment in metabolic disorders such as type II diabetes and obesity. alpha-Amylase, as the first enzyme of glucose release from dietary polysaccharides, is a potential target to identify new sources of novel anti-obesity and anti-diabetic drugs. In this work, different herbal extracts as alpha-amylase inhibitors were studied by measuring the rate of the cleavage of a maltooligomer substrate 2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl-beta-D-maltoheptoside. Measurement of chromophore containing products after reversed phase HPLC separation was used for alpha-amylase activity measurement. Rates of hydrolysis catalysed by human salivary alpha-amylase were determined in the presence and absence of lyophilised water extracts of eleven herbs. Remarkable bioactivities were found for extracts of Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume (bark), Camellia sinensis L. (leaf), Ribes nigrum L. (leaf), Laurus nobilis L. (leaf), Vaccinium macrocarpon Aiton (fruit) and Syzygium aromaticum L. (bud). Determined IC50 values were in 0.017-41 mug/ml range for these six selected plant extracts. Our results confirm the applicability of this HPLC-based method for the quick and reliable comparison of plants as alpha-amylase inhibitors.	syzygium aromaticum type ii diabetes
1	Comparative analysis of chemical compositions and antimicrobial activities of essential oils from Abies holophylla and Abies koreana activities of essential oils from Abies holophylla and Abies koreana.The chemical compositions and antibacterial and antifungal activities of essential oils extracted from Abies holophylla and A. koreana were investigated. GC-MS analysis revealed that 38 compounds comprised 95.88% of the A. holophylla essential oil, with the main components being bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-ol (28.05%), delta3-carene (13.85%), alpha-pinene (11.68%), camphene (10.41%), dl-limonene (7.61%), beta-myrcene (7.11%), trans-caryophyllene (5.36%), and alpha- bisabolol (3.67%). In the essential oil from A. koreana, 36 compounds comprised 98.67% of the oil, and the main compounds were bornyl ester (41.79%), camphene (15.31%), alpha-pinene (11.19%), dl-limonene (8.58%), fenchyl acetate (5.55%), and alpha-terpinene (2.29%). Both essential oils showed great potential of antibacterial activity against several bacteria tested, in the range of 2.2-8.8 mug per disc by the agar disc diffusion method, and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 5.5-21.8 mg/ml by the microdilution method. Both oils showed very effective antifungal activities toward all pathogenic strains tested, including Candida glabrata, with MIC values in the range of 0.5-2.2 mg/ml. As a whole, A.koreanaoil showed better antibacterial and antifungal properties than A.holophylla oil.	a. koreana dl-limonene
1	Analysis of volatile components, fatty acids, and phytosterols of Abies koreana growing in Poland.Extracts and essential oils from seeds as well as essential oils from cone scales and needles with twigs of the Abies koreana population were studied. An analysis of Korean fir essential oils allowed us to determine 147 volatile compounds. The identified compounds constituted 97-99% of the seed, cone and needle oils. The main volatile in the seed and needle oils was limonene (56.6% and 23.4%, respectively), while the predominant volatile in cone oils was alpha-pinene (51.2%). Korean fir seeds provided a rich source of both essential oil (3.8-8.5%) and extract, which was isolated with a 24.5% yield and contained numerous groups of fatty acids and phytosterols (414 microg/100g extract). The most prominent fatty acids were unsaturated, among which linoleic (41.2%) and oleic (31.2%) fatty acid were the main ones while the dominant sterols were isomers of ergostadienol and beta-sitosterol. A. koreana seeds, cones and needles are a source of many volatile bioactive compounds while the seed extract, with a pleasant scent, contained not only volatiles, but also fractions rich in fatty acids and phytosterols. These facts make A. koreana essential oils and especially the seed extract potential components of cosmetics.	a. koreana fatty acids
1	Pharmacognostic and phytochemical studies of Zanthoxylum armatum DC.The pharmacognostic and phytochemical investigations on the leaf, stem bark, and fruit of Zanthoxylum armatum were carried out. Macroscopic study of leaf, stem bark, and fruit of Z. armatum revealed some of the characteristic features like size, shape, color, odor and taste of the crude drug. Distinguishing fragments were identified from the powder drug. Leaf, bark, and fruit powder of this plant have higher values of total, acid insoluble, and water soluble ash as compared to the powder of this plant exhausted with ethanol and n- hexane. Extraction values in methanol were highest for leaves (20.10%) and fruit (11%), while bark showed highest value in chloroform (8.5%). The extractive values varied among other parts with different solvents. Fluorescence analysis of the Z. Armatum leaf, stem bark, and fruit powder with various reagents showed characteristic coloration at day and under UV light. Quantitative phytochemical screening revealed the presence of many bioactive constituents in leaves, such as alkaloids (15.60+-0.10 mg/g), sterols (71.60+-0.10mg/g), saponins (21.57+-0.12mg/g), tannins (34.43+-0.21mg/g), phenols (11.66+-0.33mg/g) and flavonoids (13.68+-0.66mg/g). Alkaloids (19.60+-0.10mg/g), sterols (33.83+-0.29mg/g), saponins (14.78+-0.10mg/g), tannins (28.62+-0.13mg/g), phenols (16.48+-1.33mg/g) and flavonoids (18.33+-1.22mg/g) were reported form the bark, while fruits were reported to have alkaloids (25.07+-0.21mg/g), sterols (164.92+-0.14mg/g), saponins (28.60+-0.10mg/g), tannins (35.5+-0.5mg/g), phenols (21.68+-0.44mg/g) and flavonoids (22.8+-1.33mg/g). Z. armatum is an important medicinal plant, traditionally used for various ailments. This study will be helpful in the future pharmacognostic standardization of this important plant.	z. armatum phenols
1	Antioxidant and antilisterial effect of seed essential oil and organic extracts from Zizyphus jujuba.Hydrodistilled volatile oil from the seeds of Zizyphus jujuba was analyzed by GC-MS. Twenty three compounds representing 91.59% of the total oil was identified. The oil and organic extracts revealed a great potential of antilisterial effect against all five strains of Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19111, 19116, 19118, 19166 and 15313. Also the oil had strong detrimental effect on the viable count of the tested bacteria. The samples were also subjected to screening for the antioxidant activity by using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and superoxide radicals scavenging activities assay. In the first case, the IC(50) value of the Z. jujuba essential oil was determined to be 5.21+/-0.01 microg/ml. Among the extracts, the strongest activity was exhibited by the methanol extract with an IC(50) value of 20.44+/-0.18 microg/ml. In the superoxide radicals scavenging activities assay, methanol extract was superior to all other extracts (IC(50)=18.60+/-0.3 microg/ml). Furthermore, the amount of total phenolic compounds was determined. The results indicate that the essential oil and extracts of Z. jujuba could serve as natural antimicrobial and antioxidant agents for the food industry.	z. jujuba DPPH
2	Zanthoxylum schinifolium leaf ethanol extract inhibits adipocyte differentiation through inactivation of the extracellular signal regulated kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathways in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes.Zanthoxylum schinifolium is widely used as a food flavoring in east Asia. Although this plant has also been used in traditional oriental medicine for the treatment of the common cold, toothache, stomach ache, diarrhea and jaundice, its anti-obesity activity remains to be elucidated. The present study investigated the effects of ethanol extract from the leaves of Z. schinifolium (EEZS) on adipocyte differentiation, and its underlying mechanism, in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes. The results demonstrated that EEZS effectively suppressed intracellular lipid accumulation at non-toxic concentrations, and was associated with the downregulation of several adipocyte-specific transcription factors, including peroxisome proliferation-activity receptor gamma (PPARgamma), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP)alpha and C/EBPbeta, in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, it was observed that EEZS markedly inactivated the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways, which act upstream of PPARgamma and C/EBPs in adipogenesis. These results suggested that EEZS inhibited lipid accumulation by downregulating the major transcription factors involved in the pathway of adipogenesis, including PPARgamma, C/EBPalpha and C/EBPbeta, via regulation of the ERK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways in 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. This indicated the potential use of EEZS as an anti-obesity agent.	z. schinifolium stomach ache
1	Identifying core features of adaptive metabolic mechanisms for chronic heat stress attenuation contributing to systems robustness.The contribution of metabolism to heat stress may play a significant role in defining robustness and recovery of systems; either by providing the energy and metabolites required for cellular homeostasis, or through the generation of protective osmolytes. However, the mechanisms by which heat stress attenuation could be adapted through metabolic processes as a stabilizing strategy against thermal stress are still largely unclear. We address this issue through metabolomic and transcriptomic profiles for populations along a thermal cline where two seagrass species, Zostera marina and Zostera noltii, were found in close proximity. Significant changes captured by these profile comparisons could be detected, with a larger response magnitude observed in northern populations to heat stress. Sucrose, fructose, and myo-inositol were identified to be the most responsive of the 29 analyzed organic metabolites. Many key enzymes in the Calvin cycle, glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathways also showed significant differential expression. The reported comparison suggests that adaptive mechanisms are involved through metabolic pathways to dampen the impacts of heat stress, and interactions between the metabolome and proteome should be further investigated in systems biology to understand robust design features against abiotic stress.	zostera noltii myo-inositol
1	A mild conversion of phenylpropropnoid into rare phenylbutanoids: (E)-4-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)but-1,3-diene and (E)-4-(2,4,5-trimethozypheny)but-1-ene occuring in Zingiber cassumunar.(E)-4-(2',4',5'-trimethoxyphenyl)but-1,3-diene (4) and (E)-4-(2',4',5'-trimethoxyphenyl)but-1-ene (6), bioactive phenylbutanoids of Zingiber cassumunar, were synthesized exclusively with trans geometry. Treatment of methylmagnesium iodide with (E)-2',4',5'-trimethoxycinnamaldehyde (2), an oxidized product of abundantly available toxic (Z)-phenylpropanoid (1) of Acorus calamus, gave (E)-4-(2',4',5'-trimethoxyphenyl)but-3-en-2-ol (3) which upon dehydration with copper sulphate/silica gel under microwave irradiation for 3 min afforded 4 in 58% yield. Further, catalytic hydrogenation of 4 with 10% Pd/C afforded 4-(2',4',5'-trimethoxyphenyl)butane (5) which upon dehydrogenation with DDQ/SiO2 afforded hypolipidemic 6 in 54% yield.	zingiber cassumunar (E)-4-(2',4',5'-trimethoxyphenyl)but-1,3-diene
1	Constituents of the root wood of Zanthoxylum wutaiense with antitubercular activity.Bioassay-guided fractionation of the root wood of Zanthoxylum wutaiense led to the isolation of 11 new compounds, wutaiensol methyl ether (1), demethoxywutaiensol methyl ether (2), methyl wutaiensate (3), methyl 7-hydroxyanodendroate (4), methyl 7-methoxyanodendroate (5), wutaifuranol (6), 7-methoxywutaifuranol (7), 7-methoxywutaifuranal (8), methyl wutaifuranate (9), methyl 7-methoxybenzofuran-5-carboxylate (10), and wutaipyranol (12), together with another 37 known compounds, of which one, 7-methoxybenzofuran-5-carboxaldehyde (11), was not previously known as a plant constituent. The structures of these isolates were identified by means of spectroscopic analysis. Five of these isolates were found to be antitubercular constituents, namely, methyl 7-methoxyanodendroate (5), 7-methoxywutaifuranal (8), wutaiensal (13), dictamnine (14), and gamma-fagarine (15), which exhibited antitubercular activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, showing MIC values of 35, 35, 30, 30, and 30 microg/mL, respectively.	zanthoxylum wutaiense gamma-fagarine
1	Inter-strains comparison of the antimicrobial effect and mode of action of a Vietnamese Cinnamomum cassia essential oil from leaves and its principal component against Listeria monocytogenes.The antibacterial activity of a Cinnamomum essential oil and of its main component trans-cinnamaldehyde (90% w/w) was examined against 5 Listeria monocytogenes strains. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of C. cassia essential oil against the 5 L. monocytogenes strains were identical (250 microg.mL-1 ) while the minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) ranged between 800 and 1200 microg.mL-1 . In order to study if this essential oil and trans-cinnamaldehyde altered the 5 strains at the membrane level, fluorescence anisotropy of 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) was measured in presence of different concentrations (1/2MIC, MIC, 2MIC) of these antibacterial agents. A concentration dependent increase of fluorescence anisotropy of DPH in their presence reflecting a rigidification of the membrane was observed for the 5 strains. This modification of the membrane fluidity was associated with a perturbation of the selective membrane permeability, as a perturbation of the gradient between intracellular and extracellular pH was also observed.	c. cassia trans-cinnamaldehyde
2	An unusual manifestation of Abrus precatorius poisoning: a report of two cases.Abrus precatorius seeds are highly toxic and are often ingested as a means of suicide in India. Hemorrhagic gastroenteritis with erosions, hemolysis, acute renal damage, hepatotoxicity with elevated liver enzymes, and seizures are common manifestations of toxicity. We report two cases of Abrus precatorius poisoning with raised intracranial pressure (ICP) and papilledema that have not been described earlier in literature. One patient recovered completely with conservative management to lower raised ICP while the other patient expired before effective treatment could be institutedd. The cases are being reported to propose the need for routine fundus examination and brain imaging in severe abrus poisoning with CNS toxicity, as early institution of treatment for cerebral edema measures may be life saving.	abrus precatorius hepatotoxicity
1	The cinnamon-derived dietary factor cinnamic aldehyde activates the Nrf2-dependent antioxidant response in human epithelial colon cells.Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of tumor-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. Recent research suggests that pharmacological intervention using dietary factors that activate the redox sensitive Nrf2/Keap1-ARE signaling pathway may represent a promising strategy for chemoprevention of human cancer including CRC. In our search for dietary Nrf2 activators with potential chemopreventive activity targeting CRC, we have focused our studies on trans-cinnamic aldehyde (cinnamaldeyde, CA), the key flavor compound in cinnamon essential oil. Here we demonstrate that CA and an ethanolic extract (CE) prepared from Cinnamomum cassia bark, standardized for CA content by GC-MS analysis, display equipotent activity as inducers of Nrf2 transcriptional activity. In human colon cancer cells (HCT116, HT29) and non-immortalized primary fetal colon cells (FHC), CA- and CE-treatment upregulated cellular protein levels of Nrf2 and established Nrf2 targets involved in the antioxidant response including heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and gamma-glutamyl-cysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS, catalytic subunit). CA- and CE-pretreatment strongly upregulated cellular glutathione levels and protected HCT116 cells against hydrogen peroxide-induced genotoxicity and arsenic-induced oxidative insult. Taken together our data demonstrate that the cinnamon-derived food factor CA is a potent activator of the Nrf2-orchestrated antioxidant response in cultured human epithelial colon cells. CA may therefore represent an underappreciated chemopreventive dietary factor targeting colorectal carcinogenesis.	cinnamomum cassia aldehyde
1	In vitro activities of plant extracts on human Loa loa isolates and cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells.Loa loa, a filarial worm, can cause fatal encephalitis in humans. In an attempt to find alternatives to the standard treatments (ivermectin and diethylcarbamazine citrate), we tested 12 methanolic extracts of nine traditional plant remedies. The extracts (100-0.09 microg/ml) were incubated with 20 Loa loa microfilariae isolated from patients at 37 degrees C with 5% CO(2) in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal serum and antibiotics. Activity was evaluated 120 h later by counting live microfilariae under a microscope. Cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells was estimated by measuring 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2-5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide transformation to formazan at 450 nM in a spectrophotometer. The plants tested were Lophira alata, Greenwayodendron suaveolens, Uapaca togoensis, Zanthoxylum heitzii, Peperomia pellucida, Piptadeniastrum africanum, Petersianthus macrocarpus, Vernonia conferta, and Vernonia hymenolepis. Chemical screening showed that most of the extracts contained reducing sugars, tannin or polyphenols, sterols or triterpenes, saponosides, and alkaloids. None contained carotinoids and few contained flavonoids. The 50% lethal concentration ranged from 0.22 to 70.28 microg/ml, while the 50% inhibitory concentration for eukaryotic cells (IC(50)) ranged from 8.52 to 119.52 microg/ml. Extracts of P. macrocarpus (selectivity index = 72.16), P. africanum (13.69), Z. heitzii (12.11), and L. alata (9.26) were highly selective for L. loa.	l. alata sugars
1	Rapid method using two microbial enzymes for detection of L-abrine in food as a marker for the toxic protein abrin.Abrin is a toxic protein produced by the ornamental plant Abrus precatorius, and it is of concern as a biothreat agent. The small coextracting molecule N-methyl-l-tryptophan (l-abrine) is specific to members of the genus Abrus and thus can be used as a marker for the presence or ingestion of abrin. Current methods for the detection of abrin or l-abrine in foods and other matrices require complex sample preparation and expensive instrumentation. To develop a fast and portable method for the detection of l-abrine in beverages and foods, the Escherichia coli proteins N-methyltryptophan oxidase (MTOX) and tryptophanase were expressed and purified. The two enzymes jointly degraded l-abrine to products that included ammonia and indole, and colorimetric assays for the detection of those analytes in beverage and food samples were evaluated. An indole assay using a modified version of Ehrlich's/Kovac's reagent was more sensitive and less subject to negative interferences from components in the samples than the Berthelot ammonia assay. The two enzymes were added into food and beverage samples spiked with l-abrine, and indole was detected as a degradation product, with the visual lower detection limit being 2.5 to 10.0 muM (~0.6 to 2.2 ppm) l-abrine in the samples tested. Results could be obtained in as little as 15 min. Sample preparation was limited to pH adjustment of some samples. Visual detection was found to be about as sensitive as detection with a spectrophotometer, especially in milk-based matrices. 	abrus precatorius l-abrine
2	An Arrow Poison (Abrus Precatorius) Causing Fatal Poisoning in a Child.Ingestion of whole seeds of Abrus precatorius often does not produce serious illness. It generally presents initially with gastrointestinal manifestations. Haemolysis, acute renal damage, hepatotoxicity and seizures are the other manifestations. Herewith we report a child with accidental ingestion of abrus precatorius seeds who presented with altered sensorium and convulsions. The case is being reported on account of its rarity in its initial neurological manifestation and has not been reported earlier in paediatric age group. 	abrus precatorius convulsions
1	Comparison of drip, pipe and surge spring root irrigation for Jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) fruit quality in the Loess plateau of China.Loess Plateau is a typical rain-fed farming region, facing the threat of drought. Irrigation method is among the most important factors affecting jujube quality. This study investigated the response of Ziziphus jujuba Mill. cv. Lizao quality to three different irrigation methods (drip-, pipe- and surge spring root irrigation) combining two water levels (20 m(3)/hm(2) and 120 m(3)/hm(2)). The effects of the trials were evaluated by taking into account the physical-chemical characteristics of jujubes and the antioxidant activity. Concomitant to this, the concentration of some taste-related (viz. glucose, fructose, TSS and malic acid) and health-related compounds/parameters (viz. catechin and epicatechin) were generally much greater in jujube fruit treated with drip irrigation (120 m(3)/hm(2)). Different irrigation treatments had no significant effects on antioxidant capacity, total phenolics and proanthocyanidins (except for pipe irrigation 20 m(3)/hm(2)). The best compromise between quality and irrigation of jujube fruit was achieved with drip irrigation (120 m(3)/hm(2)). 	jujube epicatechin
2	Antioxidative effects of Cinnamomi cassiae and Rhodiola rosea extracts in liver of diabetic mice.Both Cinnamomi cassiae and Rhodiola rosea extracts are used as anti-diabetic folk medicines. Recently, increased oxidative stress was shown to play an important role in the etiology and pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus and its complications. This study was designed to examine the effects of Cinnamomi cassiae and Rhodiola rosea extracts on blood glucose, lipid peroxidation, the level of reduced glutathione and its related enzymes (glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase), and the activity of the antioxidant enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase) in the liver of db/db mice. Diabetic C57BL/Ks db/db mice were used as experimental models. Mice were divided into control (n=10), Cinnamomi cassiae (200 mg/kg/day, n=10), and Rhodiola rosea (200 mg/kg/day, n=10) treated groups for 12 weeks of treatment. These type II diabetic mice were used to investigate the effects of Cinnamomi cassiae and Rhodiola rosea on blood glucose, reduced glutathione, glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase, lipid peroxidation, catalase and superoxide dismutase. Cinnamomi cassiae and Rhodiola rosea extracts significantly decreased on blood glucose, increased levels of reduced glutathione and the activities of glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase in the liver. Extract treatment also significantly decreased lipid peroxidation. Cinnamomi cassiae and Rhodiola rosea extracts may be effective for correcting hyperglycemia and preventing diabetic complications.	cinnamomi cassiae diabetic complications
2	Zizyphus attenuates ischemic damage in the gerbil hippocampus via its antioxidant effect.The fruit of Zizyphus jujuba has been used as a traditional Chinese medicinal herb and considered for thousands of years to affect various physiological functions in the body. We obtained a Z. jujuba extract (ZJE) and observed the neuroprotective effects of ZJE against ischemic damage in gerbils that had received repeated oral administrations of ZJE for 10 days. In the ZJE-treated ischemia group, neuronal nuclei (a marker for neurons)-immunoreactive neurons were abundant (58.4% vs. sham group) in the hippocampal CA1 region 4 days after ischemia/reperfusion compared to those in the vehicle-treated ischemia group (11.3%). In addition, ZJE treatment significantly decreased the reactive gliosis of astrocytes and microglia in the CA1 region compared to that in the vehicle-treated group 4 days after ischemia/reperfusion. Immunoreactivities of Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the ZJE-treated ischemia group were higher those in the vehicle-treated ischemia group 4 days after ischemia/reperfusion. In addition, in the ZJE-treated ischemia group, levels of hydroxynonenal, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were much lower than those in the vehicle-treated ischemia group after ischemia/reperfusion. These results suggest that the repeated supplements of ZJE can protect neurons from ischemic damage via up-regulation of SOD1 and reduction of lipid peroxidation in the ischemic hippocampal CA1 region.	z. jujuba ischemic damage
2	Activity-directed fractionation and isolation of four antibacterial compounds from Abrus precatorius L. roots.Root extracts of the plant Abrus precatorius L. was tested for antibacterial activity. Various solvent fractions exhibited inhibitory activity against 13 gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Root extracts were analyzed by thin layer chromatography. The antibacterial activity was localized to specific chromatophores in the chloroform fraction through a bioautography assay. It was found localized to 4 chromatophores out of 7. The chromatophores were isolated from the TLC plates and rechecked for activity against Staphylococcus aureus A, using a disc diffusion assay. Among the four active principles isolated, AP 3 (Rf 0.87) exhibited maximum activity, i.e., 56% inhibition of growth of S. aureus A, in disc diffusion assay compared to the standard antibiotic Ampicillin. Results of this study suggest that chloroform extractable phytochemicals in A. precatorius L. may yield promising molecules with antibiotic activity.	a. precatorius antibacterial
1	The inhibitory effects of jujuboside A on rat hippocampus in vivo and in vitro.Jujuboside A (JuA) is a glycoside extracted from the seed of Ziziphus jujuba Mill var. spinosa (Bunge) Hu ex H F Chou, a Chinese herbal medicine, which has long been known as a sedative-hypnotic drug. The present study used the method of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) JuA in vivo to detect the effect of JuA on paired-pulse responses of dentate gyrus granule cells in urethane-anaesthetized rats, and the method of hippocampal slice bathing in JuA in vitro to detect the effects of JuA on the responses of CA1 pyramidal cells. The results showed that JuA significantly decreased the slopes of excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) and the amplitudes of population spike (PS) in the first responses of granule cells and significantly decreased EPSP and PS in the responses of CA1 pyramidal cells. The good quantitative correspondence between in vitro and in vivo results indicates that studies using hippocampal formation allow research on the inhibitory effects of JuA in the rat central nervous system (CNS). In conclusion, our study accessed the inhibitory effects of JuA on hippocampal formation in vivo and in vitro, which contributed to the further research on the mechanism of its effects on CNS.	ziziphus jujuba mill var glycoside
1	Effects of oligochitosan on postharvest Alternaria rot, storage quality, and defense responses in Chinese jujube (Zizyphus jujuba Mill. cv. Dongzao) fruit.Effects of oligochitosan (OCH) on postharvest rot caused by Alternaria alternata in Chinese jujube (Zizyphus jujuba Mill. cv. Dongzao) fruit were investigated. An in vitro test indicated that mycelial growth of A. alternata was strongly suppressed by OCH at 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, or 20 g/liter. The half-inhibition concentration of OCH against this fungus was 0.76 and 1.69 g/liter on days 4 and 6 of incubation, respectively. Lesion area and disease incidence in the jujube fruit inoculated with A. alternata were remarkably reduced by the OCH treatments at concentrations higher than 1 g/liter, but 5 g/liter OCH was considered the optimal treatment for inhibiting disease development. OCH also significantly reduced postharvest natural decay, promoted fruit firmness, delayed decline in soluble solids and loss of ascorbic acid, and increased total phenolic compounds during storage at 0 C and 85 to 95% relative humidity. Biochemical evaluations revealed that the activities of the main defense-related enzymes in the jujube fruit, including phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, peroxidase, chitinase, and beta-1,3-glucanase, were significantly enhanced (P &lt; 0.05) by OCH treatment. OCH increased superoxide dismutase activity but decreased catalase activity and, consequently, elevated hydrogen peroxide levels in the fruit. These results suggest that OCH might trigger several defense mechanisms in the jujube fruit for disease control in addition to its direct antifungal activity. OCH could be a viable alternative to conventional control of postharvest diseases of horticultural products.	jujube oligochitosan
1	Suppression effect of Cinnamomum cassia bark-derived component on nitric oxide synthase.The inhibitory effects of Cinnamomum cassia bark-derived material on nitric oxide (NO) production in RAW 264.7 cells was determined through the evaluation of NO production and expression of inducible nitric oxide and compared to the effects of three commercially available compounds, cinnamyl alcohol, cinnamic acid, and eugenol. The biologically active constituents of C. cassia extract were characterized as trans-cinnamaldehyde by spectral analysis. The inhibitory effects varied with both chemical and concentration used. Potent inhibitory effects of cinnamaldehyde against NO production were 81.5 and 71.7% at 1.0 and 0.5 microg/microL, respectively, and a 41.2% inhibitory effect was revealed at 0.1 microg/microL. However, little or no activity was observed for cinnamic acid and eugenol. Suppression effects of cinnamaldehyde on inducible nitric oxide synthase expression were revealed by Western blot analysis. As a naturally occurring therapeutic agent, trans-cinnamaldehyde could be useful for developing new types of NO inhibitors.	c. cassia trans-cinnamaldehyde
3	Cinnamaldehyde protects against oxidative stress and inhibits the TNF-alpha-induced inflammatory response in human umbilical vein endothelial cells.Oxidative stress and inflammation play critical roles in the development of cardiovascular diseases. Cinnamaldehyde (CA) is a natural compound from Cinnamomum cassia, and its anticancer, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities have been widely investigated. In the present study, the cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of CA on H2O2- or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-exposed human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were examined. CA and its natural derivative, 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde (MCA), markedly increased the cellular protein level of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and promoted the translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) to the nucleus. CA-mediated Nrf2/HO-1 activation protected the HUVECs from H2O2-induced oxidative stress, which promotes apoptosis. HO-1 depletion by siRNA attenuated the CA-mediated cell protective effects against oxidative stress. Additionally, CA markedly inhibited the adhesion of U937 monocytic cells to HUVECs by decreasing the expression level of vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM-1). An in vivo experiment confirmed the anti-inflammatory effects of CA, as lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory cell infiltration was effectively inhibited by the compound. Overall, these observations suggest that CA may be used as a therapeutic agent for oxidative stress-mediated cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis.	Cinnamaldehyde atherosclerosis
1	2'-Hydroxycinnamaldehyde targets low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 to inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced microglial activation.2'-Hydroxycinnamaldehyde (HCA) isolated from the stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia and its derivative 2'-benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde (BCA) were reported to have anti-angiogenic, anti-proliferative, and anti-inflammatory effects in several human cancer cells and RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. However, effects of HCA/BCA on the neuroinflammation have not been investigated. In the present study, a potential anti-neuroinflammatory effect of HCA/BCA was assessed in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated microglial cultures and microglia/neuroblastoma cocultures. Nitric oxide production, inflammatory gene expression, and signaling pathways were investigated. HCA/BCA significantly decreased the production of nitric oxide and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in microglial cells. HCA/BCA also attenuated the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and TNF-alpha at mRNA level via blockade of ERK, JNK, p38 MAPK, and NF-kappaB activation. Moreover, HCA/BCA was neuroprotective by reducing microglia-mediated neuroblastoma cell death in a microglia-neuroblastoma co-culture. Affinity chromatography and LC-MS/MS analysis identified low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) as a potential molecular target of HCA in microglial cells. Based on the studies using the receptor-associated protein (RAP) that blocks a ligand binding to LRP1 and the siRNA-mediated LRP1 gene silencing, we were able to conclude that HCA inhibited LPS-induced microglial activation via LRP1. Our results suggest that HCA/BCA be anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective in the CNS by targeting LRP1, and may have a therapeutic potential against neuroinflammatory diseases.	cinnamomum cassia HCA
1	A case of abrin toxin poisoning, confirmed via quantitation of L-abrine (N-methyl-L-tryptophan) biomarker.INTRODUCTION: The seeds of Abrus precatorius contain the highly toxic plant protein abrin. There is no antidote for abrin poisoning. Management, largely supportive, may consist of administering intravenous fluids, anti-emetics, and activated charcoal depending on the time of exposure. We report the presentation of a single case of unintentional abrin poisoning confirmed by the quantitation of L-abrine biomarker. CASE REPORT: A previously healthy 22-month-old, 11.5-kg female presented to the hospital after ingesting approximately 20 rosary peas (A. precatorius) sold as a "peace bracelet". Her primary manifestations were episodes of forceful emesis that included food particles progressing to clear gastric fluid. The patient was tachycardic (HR = 134 bpm) but had brisk capillary refill and normal blood pressure (96/60 mmHg). Laboratory testing revealed elevated blood urea nitrogen (16 mg/dL) and serum creatinine (0.4 mg/dL). In the emergency department, the patient was resuscitated with 40 mL/kg normal saline via peripheral IV and received ondansetron (0.15 mg/kg IV) to control retching. The patient was discharged well 24 h after the ingestion. DISCUSSION: This is the first case of human abrin toxin poisoning confirmed by the quantitation of L-abrine as a biomarker. Quantifying the levels of abrin toxin in the body after exposure can help clinicians make informed decisions when managing patients with symptomatic exposures to seeds of A. precatorius.	a. precatorius L-abrine

2	Pharmacognostic specification of Zanthoxylum limonella (Dennst.) Alston: Fruits and seeds in Thailand.Zanthoxylum limonella (Dennst.) Alston. (Rutaceae) or Ma-khwaen is one of the medicinal plants in Thai traditional medicine. To investigate the pharmacognostic specifications and chemical constituents of Z. limonella fruits and seeds. Fruits and seeds of Z. limonella were collected from 15 sources throughout Thailand; then examined the pharmacognostic specification following WHO guideline of quality control method for medicinal plant materials. Microscopic determination of Z. limonella powders demonstrated fragment of mesocarp, fragment of brown vitta, oil glands, fragment of endocarp, and endosperm containing oil globule, trichome and pale brown stone cells. Stomatal index and pellucid dots in mm2 were 19.87 and 4.2 respectively. Physico-chemical parameters unveiled that loss on drying, water content, total ash, and acid-insoluble ash should be not &gt;17.90%, 9.18%, 4.50%, and 0.60% of dried weight respectively; while ethanol, water, and hexane extractive values and volatile oil content should be not &lt;2.24%, 2.27%, 1.57% and 9.63% of dried weight respectively. Rf values of thin-layer chromatographic fingerprint of Z. limonella fruits and seeds ethanolic extract were 0.38, 0.45, 0.90, and 0.97 detected ultraviolet (UV) light 254 nm, 0.30, 0.44, 0.67, and 0.77 detected UV light 366 nm, and 0.24, 0.73, 0.78, and 0.93 detected 10% sulfuric acid. There are three main chemical compounds in Z. limonella oil including limonene (43.63%), (+)-sabinene (16.72%), and terpinen-4-ol (10.95%). The result gained from pharmacognostic specifications and chemical fingerprints could be used as standardization data of Z. limonella fruits and seeds to apply or provide for guarantee of quality.	z. limonella terpinen-4-ol
2	To what extent does cinnamon administration improve the glycemic and lipid profiles?BACKGROUND & AIMS: Cinnamon is a condiment used in cooking and by some in large quantities as a supplement with purported hypoglycemic and lipid-lowering potential. The current literature review aims to discuss the evidence of cinnamon administration regarding its hypoglycemic and lipid-lowering effects, summarizing clinical recommendations. METHODS: Electronic databases including PubMed, Cochrane library, Science Direct and Web of Science were searched with the scientific name of the plant as well as the common name. The search for articles was based on following keywords: "cinnamon diabetes", "cinnamon diabetes type 2", "cinnamon and diabetes type 2", "Cinnamomum aromaticum", "Cinnamomum cassia", "Cinnamomum verum", "Cinnamomum zeylanicum". We carried out inclusion criteria between 2003 and 2018 focusing on human studies. RESULTS: Concerning glycemic profile, in individuals with type II diabetes mellitus the fasting blood glucose reduced from 12.9 to 52.2 mg/dL and HbA1c from 0.27 to 0.83%, whereas serum insulin decreased in few studies. Research papers ranged from 6 to 17 weeks in duration. The lipid lowering potential, in turn, is most controversial compared to anti-hyperglycemic potential. Also cinnamon administration has been claimed to reduce fat mass and raise serum antioxidants, but the studies used inaccurate methods. Two species are most investigated, C. cassia/aromaticum, and C.zeylanicum/verum. CONCLUSIONS: About 1-6 g of these cinnamon species mainly in powder seems to be an adjunct drug treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus and other conditions of glycemic impairment. However, more controlled clinical trials are needed.	cinnamon diabetes mellitus
1	Triterpenoids isolated from Zizyphus jujuba inhibit foam cell formation in macrophages.Because foam cell formation in macrophages is believed to play an essential role in the progression of early atherosclerotic lesions in vivo, prevention of foam cell formation is considered to be one of the major targets for the treatment of atherosclerosis. The present study examined the inhibitory effect of 50 crude plant extracts on foam cell formation. Among those crude extracts, Zizyphi Fructus (ZF) and Zizyphi Semen (ZS) extracts significantly inhibited the foam cell formation induced by acetylated LDL. Furthermore, triterpenoids such as oleanonic acid, pomolic acid, and pomonic acid were the major active compounds, and triterpenoids containing a carboxylic acid at C-28 play an important role in the inhibitory effect on foam cell formation in human macrophages. These data suggest that triterpenoids in Zizyphus jujuba , the plant source of ZF and ZS, may therefore be useful for the prevention of atherosclerosis.	zizyphus jujuba oleanonic acid
2	A nutraceutical combination of Cinnamomum cassia &amp;Nigella sativa for Type 1 diabetes mellitus.BACKGROUND: Nigella sativa (black cumin) and Cinnamomum cassia (Cinnamon) are an integral part of the Indian diet, and have also been sourced in the ayurveda, the traditional Indian system of medicine, for their medicinal properties. Both the herbs individually have been successfully evaluated for their preliminary antidiabetic potential. OBJECTIVE: Herein, we dived deeper into antidiabetic properties of these herbs, by investigating the combinatorial effect of both herbs, on parameters of diabetes and further, as an adjunct to metformin therapy, for assessing the pharmacodynamics of herb-drug interaction in diabetes mellitus. The objectives were to screen the combinatorial extract of Nigella sativa &amp; Cinnamomum cassia's (NSCCe) alone and in combination with metformin for its potential in mitigating symptoms of diabetes mellitus-alone, and as an adjunct therapy with metformin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Diabetes was induced in the animals by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. Animals were divided into seven groups with 6 animals each: Vehicle control, Negative control, Positive control (Metformin 50 mg/kg), treatment groups 4 and 5 received NSCCe at the doses of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg, respectively. Groups 6 and 7 received the same doses, in combination with Metformin (50 and 25 mg/kg). Following a 28-day dosing period, plasma glucose levels, lipid profile and renal function profile were evaluated. Histopathological examinations were performed to measure any morphological change in kidney, liver and pancreatic tissue. RESULTS: Combination of Nigella sativa &amp; Cinnamomum cassia extracts significantly normalized plasma glucose levels, lipid profile and kidney function parameters, compared to the diabetic control group. Animals treated with the combinatorial extract and metformin showed more prominent effects on these parameters. Significant reversal in the pancreatic cell damage was observed on treatment with NSCCe. CONCLUSION: This study generates evidence to support Nigella sativa &amp; Cinnamomum cassia as an adjunctive in diabetes treatment protocols.	nigella sativa type 1 diabetes mellitus
2	Traditional herbal remedies used for the treatment of urinary schistosomiasis in Zimbabwe.A total of 286 traditional healers, 85% of them registered with the Zimbabwe National Traditional Healers' Association (ZINATHA), in five administrative provinces of Zimbabwe, were interviewed to assess their knowledge about the signs and symptoms of urinary schistosomiasis. Information on the names of plants used to treat Schistosoma haematobium infections was solicited. Haematuria was mentioned by 99% of the traditional healers to be the most obvious sign of S. haematobium infection. General body weakness, increased urinary frequency and pain on micturition also were reported to be some of the signs of infection. Eight plant materials were identified as the most commonly used for the treatment of S. haematobium. The plants were identified and parts collected to investigate their antischistosomal properties. The plant materials were prepared according to the guidelines of the traditional healers and their efficacy determined by administering the crude extracts orally to hamsters infected with S. haematobium cercariae. The results obtained suggested that plant extracts from Abrus precatorius (Leguminosae), Pterocarpus angolensis (Leguminosae) and Ozoroa insignis (Anacardiaceae) were lethal to adult schistosomes.	ozoroa insignis schistosoma haematobium infections
1	[Analysis and utilization value discussion of multiple chemical composition in different tissues of Abelmoschus manihot].This research is to analyze the resourceful chemical composition in different tissues (root, stem, leaf and flower) of Abelmoschus manihot and evaluate their utilizing value. The flavonoids, soluble polysaccharides, cellulose, nucleosides and amino acids in the different tissues of A. manihot were determined by HPLC coupled with UV-Vis spectrophotpmetry, and UPLC-TQ/MS. The flowers are rich in the resourceful chemical compositions of flavonoids which mainly consist of hyperoside, isoquercitrin, cotton-8-O-glucuronide, myricetin, quercetin-3'-O-glucoside, rutin and quercetin. The total content of these flavonoids is 25.450 mg g-1 in the flowers, while they are trace in the other tissues.Different tissues of A. manihot are rich in soluble polysaccharides and celluloses and the stems have the highest content(19.76%) of soluble polysaccharides, while the roots have the highest content (29.88%) of cellulose. Total of 21 amino acids and 9 nucleosides were detected in this plant, and the flowers have the highest content of amino acids(4.737 mg g-1), while the leaves have the highest content of nucleosides (1.474 mg g-1). A. manihot is rich in the resourceful chemical compositions, and its constituents and contents are various in different tissues of this plant.The results provided a scientific basis for the utilization and industrial development of A. manihot plants.	a. manihot hyperoside
1	A platinum(II) complex of liriodenine from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM): Cell cycle arrest, cell apoptosis induction and telomerase inhibition activity via G-quadruplex DNA stabilization.Liriodenine (L), an antitumor active ingredient from the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Zanthoxylum nitidum, afforded a platinum(II) complex (1) of L, cis-[PtCl2(L)(DMSO)], which previously reported for its in vitro antitumor activity and intercalative binding with DNA. In this study, complex 1 was further discussed for its antitumor mechanism and structure-activity relationship, comparing with L and cisplatin. Towards the most sensitive BEL-7404 human hepatoma cells, complex 1 significantly induced cell cycle arrest at both G2/M phase and S phase. It suggests that double helix DNA is not the simplex intracellular target for 1. On the other hand, the BEL-7404 cells incubated with 1 and stained by Hoechst 33258 and AO/EB showed typical cell apoptosis in dose-dependent manner. The BEL-7404 cells incubated with 1 and stained by JC-1 were also characteristic for cell apoptosis on the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, the G-quadruplex DNA binding property of complex 1 was also investigated by spectroscopic analyses, fluorescent indicator displacement (FID) assay and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. The results indicated that 1 stabilized the human telomeric G4-HTG21 DNA better than L. The telomerase inhibition ratio of 1 ((62.50+-0.03)%), which was examined by telomerase polymerase chain reaction-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (PCR-ELISA), was much higher than L ((21.77+-0.01)%). It can be ascribed to the better G4-HTG21 DNA stabilization of 1 than L. The results suggested that the nuclei, mitochondria and telomerase via G-quadruplex DNA stabilization all should be key targets for the antitumor mechanism of 1, in which the central platinum(II) played a key role. 	zanthoxylum nitidum Liriodenine
3	New polyunsaturated fatty acid amides isolated from the seeds of Zanthoxylum piperitum.Five linear fatty acid amides (1-5) of the sandshool class, including two new compounds, were isolated from Zanthoxylum piperitum seeds. Based on combined spectral analyses, the structures of new compounds 4 and 5 were determined to be 2',3'-dihydroxy-alpha-sanshool and 2',3'-dihydroxy-beta-sanshool, respectively. These compounds exhibited weak cytotoxicity in the A-549 (human lung cancer) cell line.	2',3'-dihydroxy-beta-sanshool cytotoxicity
3	Optimization of ultrasonic extraction of polysaccharides from Ziziphus jujuba Mill. by response surface methodology.BACKGROUND: Ziziphus jujuba Mill. is nutritious and used as food and medicine for more than two thousand years. It has many pharmacological effects, such as elimination of fatigue, dilation of blood vessels, etc. The polysaccharide in it is one of the bioactive substances. In this paper, the ultrasonic extraction effects on the yield and activity of polysaccharide were studied. RESULTS: The optimum ultrasonic extraction conditions were investigated based on a Box-Behnken statistical experimental design. Response surface methodology (RSM) of three factors (ultrasonic power, extraction time and extraction temperature) and three levels was employed to optimize the yield and the antioxidant activity of the polysaccharides. The experimental data were fitted to quadratic response surface models using multiple regression analysis. The best extraction conditions were 120 W, 15 min. and 55 C for highest yield, and 80 W, 15 min. and 40 C for highest hydroxyl radical scavenging activity. CONCLUSION: The study showed that high ultrasonic power was good for obtaining high yield but bad for keeping the antioxidant activity of the polysaccharides.	polysaccharides fatigue
4	Sichuan pepper extracts block the PAK1/cyclin D1 pathway and the growth of NF1-deficient cancer xenograft in mice.There is increasing evidence that more than 70% of cancers including pancreatic, breast and prostate cancers as well as neurofibromatosis (NF) are highly addicted to abnormal activation of the Ser/Thr kinase PAK1 for their growth. So far FK228 is the most potent among the HDAC (histone deacetylase) inhibitors that block the activation of both PAK1 and another kinase AKT, downstream of PI-3 kinase. However, FK228 is still in clinical trials (phase 2) for a variety of cancers (but not for NF as yet), and not available for most cancer/NF patients. Thus, we have been exploring an alternative which is already in the market, and therefore immediately useful for the treatment of those desperate cancer/NF patients. Here we provide the first evidence that extracts of Chinese/ Japanese peppercorns (Zanthoxyli Fructus) from the plant Zanthoxylum piperitum called "Hua Jiao"/"Sansho", block selectively the key kinase PAK1, leading to the downregulation of cyclin D1. Unlike FK228, these extracts do not inhibit AKT activation at the concentrations that block either cancer growth or PAK1 activation. The Chinese pepper extract selectively inhibits the growth of NF1-deficient malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) cells, without affecting the growth of normal fibroblasts, and suppresses the growth of NF1-deficient human breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) xenograft in mice. Our data suggest that these peppercorn extracts would be potentially useful for the treatment of PAK1-dependent NF such as MPNST, in addition to a variety of PAK1-dependent cancers including breast cancers.	cyclin d1 breast cancers
1	Alkaloids from the roots of Zanthoxylum nitidum and their antiviral and antifungal effects.Five alkaloids, 5,6-dihydro-6-methoxynitidine (1), dictamnine (2), gamma-fagarine (3), skimmianine (4), and 5-methoxydictamnine (5), were isolated from the roots of Zanthoxylum nitidum. Their structures and configurations were elucidated by spectroscopic methods and X-ray analysis. Compounds 1, 4, and 5 showed in vitro antiviral effect against hepatitis B virus, and compounds 2, 3, and 5 demonstrated marked antimitotic and antifungal activity.	zanthoxylum nitidum gamma-fagarine
1	Optimization of green extraction methods for cinnamic acid and cinnamaldehyde from Cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia) by response surface methodology.The major compounds of cinnamon are cinnamic acid and cinnamaldehyde, for which the conditions of microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE), and reflux extraction (RE) were optimized using response surface methodology for comparing their efficiencies in terms of extraction yield, consumption of time and energy, and CO2 emission. The results indicated MAE superiority to UAE and RE owing to the highest yield of target compounds (total yield: 0.89%, cinnamic acid: 6.48 mg/100 mL, and cinnamaldehyde: 244.45 mg/100 mL) at optimum MAE conditions: 59% ethanol, 147.5 W microwave power and 3.4 min of extraction time. RE resulted in comparable yields with the highest consumption of time, energy, and solvent, and least CO2 emission. Therefore, it is concluded that MAE is the most efficient method for green extraction of cinnamic acid and cinnamaldehyde from cinnamon powder compared to UAE and RE.	cinnamomum cassia cinnamic acid
2	Hepatoprotective activity of leaves of Zanthoxylum armatum DC in CCl4 induced hepatotoxicity in rats.Zanthoxylum armatum DC (Rutaceae) is extensively used in indigenous system of medicine as a tonic, carminative, stomachic and anthelmintic. In the present study, the hepatoprotective activity of the leaves ethanolic extract of Z. armatum (EEZA) was evaluated in CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity in rats. The extract at a dose of 500 mg/kg registered a significant decrease in the levels of serum glutamyl oxalacetic acid transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamyl pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase (ALKP), and serum bilurubin (SBLN) and liver inflammation, which was supported by histopathological studies on liver, thus exhibited a significant hepatoprotective activity. The phytochemical screening of defatted ethanolic extract showed the presence of sterols, alkaloids, flavonoids, and reducing sugars.	z. armatum hepatotoxicity

1	Chemical composition and antibacterial activity of the essential oil from green huajiao (Zanthoxylum schinifolium) against selected foodborne pathogens.Green huajiao, which is the ripe pericarp of the fruit of Zanthoxylum schinifolium Sieb. et Zucc, is widely consumed in Asia as a spice. In this work, the chemical composition of the essential oil from green huajiao was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) and GC/mass spectrometry (MS), and the majority of components were identified. Linalool (28.2%), limonene (13.2%), and sabinene (12.1%) were found to be the major components. The antibacterial activity, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the essential oil were evaluated against selected bacteria, including food-borne pathogens. The results showed that the sensitivities to the essential oil were different for different bacteria tested, and the susceptibility of Gram-positive bacteria tested was observed to be greater than that of Gram-negative bacteria. The antibacterial activity of the essential oil was particularly strong against Staphylococcus epidermidis , with MIC and MBC values of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/mL, respectively. A postcontact effect assay also confirmed the essential oil had a significant effect on the growth rate of surviving S. epidermidis . The antibacterial activity of the essential oil from green huajiao may be due to the increase in permeability of cell membranes, and the leakage of intracellular constituents, on the basis of the cell constituents' release assay and electron microscopy observations. 	zanthoxylum schinifolium limonene
1	Essential oil from Zanthoxylum tingoassuiba loaded into multilamellar liposomes useful as antimicrobial agents.Zanthoxylum tingoassuiba essential oil (EO) is a complex mixture of organic compounds among which methyl-N-methylanthranilate and sesquiterpene alcohol alpha-bisabolol represent the main compounds. The essential oil antimicrobial activity was studied against bacteria and fungi cells by diffusion disk method and significant activity was observed against S. aureus, S. aureus isolated multi-resistant and the dermathophyte fungi. Essential oil from Zanthoxylum tingoassuiba loaded into DPPC multilamellar liposomes (MLV) was successfully produced through a thin film hydration method with mean diameter of 9.37 +/- 4.69 microm. The EO-loaded liposomes showed adequate sphericity and narrower size distribution than empty liposomes. Results also showed that Zanthoxylum tingoassuiba essential oil can be incorporated in appreciable amounts (43.7 +/- 6.0%) in the prepared vesicular dispersions. A strong interaction between essential oil and lipid bilayer was indicated by a significant decrease in T(m) of the EO-loaded liposomes related to empty vesicles. Essential oil showed incomplete release profile from liposomes, suggesting that EO-loaded liposomes will be useful in pharmaceutical applications to enhance essential oil targeting to cells.	zanthoxylum tingoassuiba sesquiterpene alcohol
1	2-Methoxycinnamaldehyde inhibits the TNF-alpha-induced proliferation and migration of human aortic smooth muscle cells.The abnormal proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is a crucial event in the development of atherosclerosis, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is actively involved in this process by enhancing the proliferation and migration of VSMCs. 2-Methoxycinnamaldehyde (MCA) is a natural compound of Cinnamomum cassia. Although 2-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (HCA), another compound from Cinnamomum cassia, has been widely studied with regard to its antitumor activity, MCA has not attracted researchers' interest due to its mild toxic effects on cancer cells and its mechanisms of action remain unknown. In this study, we examined the effects of MCA on the TNF-alpha-induced proliferation and migration of human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). As shown by our results, MCA inhibited TNF-alpha-induced cell proliferation by reducing the levels of cyclin D1, cyclin D3, CDK4 and CDK6, and increasing the levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p21 and p27, without resulting in cellular cytotoxicity. Furthermore, MCA decreased the level of secreted matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 by inhibiting MMP-9 transcription. Unexpectedly, MCA did not affect the TNF-alpha-induced levels of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). However, by showing that MCA potently inhibited the degradation of IkappaBalpha and the subsequent nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), we demonstrated that MCA exerts its effects through the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. MCA also effectively inhibited platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced HASMC migration. Taken together, these observations suggest that MCA has the potential for use as an anti-atherosclerotic agent.	cinnamomum cassia MCA
2	Studies on the toxicity of an aqueous extract of the leaves of Abrus precatorius in rats.The toxic effects of an aqueous extract of Abrus precatorius were studied in 20 male white rats over a period of 18 days. The rats were divided into four groups of five rats per group. Those in Group A served as controls while the rats in Groups B, C and D were dosed per os with 400 mg/kg, 800 mg/kg and 1 600 mg/kg of the extract, respectively. Blood samples were collected for haematological and biochemical analysis and specimens of the liver, kidney and testes were taken for histopathological studies. The study showed that the extract of A. precatorius caused decreased levels of packed cell volume, haemoglobin concentration, red blood cell count, white blood cell count, mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular haemoglobin. The extract also resulted in increased levels of total serum protein, albumin, alanine amino transaminase, aspartate amino transferase, alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin. Histologically, testicular degeneration characterized by decreased numbers of lining cells of the epithelium as well as reduction in sperm cells with presence of scattered Sertoli cells were noted. The study thus showed that aqueous extract of Abrus precatorius is toxic and caution should be exercised in its use for medicinal purpose.	abrus precatorius testicular degeneration
3	Abrin P2 suppresses proliferation and induces apoptosis of colon cancer cells via mitochondrial membrane depolarization and caspase activation.To explore the cytotoxic mechanism of abrin P2 on human colon cancer HCT-8 cells, abrin P2 was isolated from the seed of Abrus precatorius L. It was found that abrin P2 exhibited cytotoxicity toward 12 different human cancer cell lines. Our results demonstrated that abrin P2 suppressed the proliferation of human colon cancer cells (HCT-8 cells) and induced cell cycle arrest at the S and G2/M phases. The mechanism by which abrin P2 inhibited cell proliferation was via the down-regulation of cyclin B1, proliferating cell nuclear antigen and Ki67, as well as the up-regulation of P21. In addition, abrin P2 induced a dose- and time-dependent increase in the rate of HCT-8 cell apoptosis. Treatment with both Z-VAD-FMK, a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, and abrin P2 demonstrated that abrin P2 induced HCT-8 cell apoptosis via the activation of caspases. Together, our results revealed that abrin P2-induced apoptosis in HCT-8 cells was associated with the activation of caspases-3/-8/-9, the reduction in the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and the increase in cytochrome c release. We further showed that abrin P2 administration effectively suppressed the growth of colon cancer xenografts in nude mice. This is the first report that abrin P2 effectively inhibits colon cancer cell growth in vivo and in vitro by suppressing proliferation and inducing apoptosis. 	abrin p2 colon cancer
1	Active compound diffusivity of particle size reduced S. aromaticum and C. cassia fused starch edible films and the shelf life of mutton (Capra aegagrus hircus) meat.In the present study, mathematical models were used to examine the effect of active compound diffusion from edible film (supplemented with S. aromaticum and C. cassia) on the microbial, physical and chemical quality of mutton stored at 4 and 10 C. Cinnamaldehyde and eugenol release from edible film into liquid was found to be 80% and 75% of the equilibrium concentration. Active compound release into meat was 42-51% for cinnamaldehyde and 38-48% for eugenol, in storage temperatures of 4-15 C. Developed mathematical models showed the diffusivity of cinnamaldehyde (0.45x10-15+-0.04x10-15) and eugenol (0.63x10-10+-0.01x10-10) into meat, which was about 40% of that in liquid medium. On comparing physical, chemical and microbial results, shelf life of mutton meat was found to be increased by 1week at storage temperature of 10 C and 3weeks at storage temperature of 4 C.	s. aromaticum cinnamaldehyde
1	Characterization of triterpenic acids in fruits of ziziphus species by HPLC-ELSD-MS.The fruits of Ziziphus species have been utilized as food as well as crude drugs for their health benefits in China for thousands of years. This paper reported a reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for the simultaneous characterization and quantitation of 11 triterpenic acids in chloroform extracts of jujube fruits by using an evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD) and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The results showed that the contents of triterpenic acids in the fruits of Ziziphus jujuba var. spinosa were higher than those in the fruits of Z. jujuba, especially for the compound pomonic acid. Differences were also found among the different parts of Z. jujuba var. spinosa fruits with the sarcocarp having a higher amount of triterpenic acids than the seed and hard core.	z. jujuba var pomonic acid

2	In vitro anti-Helicobacter pylori action of 30 Chinese herbal medicines used to treat ulcer diseases.Infection by Helicobacter pylori has been ascertained to be an important etiologic impetus leading usually to chronic active gastritis and gastric ulcer with growing incidences worldwide. Utilizing as the test pathogen a standard and five clinic strains of Helicobacter pylori, the antibacterial action was assessed in vitro with ethanol extracts of 30 Chinese herbal medicines which have been frequently prescribed since ancient times for treating gastritis-like disorders. Among the 30 tested materials, the ethanol extracts of Abrus cantoniensis (Fabaceae), Saussurea lappa (Asteraceae) and Eugenia caryophyllata (Myrtaceae) were strongly inhibitory to all test strains (MICs: approximately 40 microg/ml), and Hippophae rhamnoides (Elaeagnaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii (Liliaceae), Magnolia officinalis and Schisandra chinensis (Magnoliaceae), Corydalis yanhusuo (Papaveraceae), Citrus reticulata (Rutaceae), Bupleurum chinense and Ligusticum chuanxiong (Apiaceae) substantially active with MICs close to 60.0 microg/ml. As to antibacterial actions of the aqueous extracts of the same drugs, those derived from Cassia obtusifolia (Fabaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii and Eugenia caryophyllata were remarkably inhibitory against all the six Helicobacter pylori strains (MICs: approximately 60 microg/ml). The work compared almost quantitatively the magnitude of the anti-Helicobacter pylori actions of the 30 most prescribed gastritis-treating Chinese herbal drugs, and located as well some source plants where potent anti-Helicobacter pylori phytochemicals could be characterized.	abrus cantoniensis ulcer diseases
3	Cinnamaldehyde enhances apoptotic effect of oxaliplatin and reverses epithelial-mesenchymal transition and stemnness in hypoxic colorectal cancer cells.Oxaliplatin has been widely applied in clinical tumor chemotherapy, the treatment failure of which mainly blames on low susceptibility resulted from intrinsic or acquired drug resistance in tumor cells. Microenvironmental hypoxia is one of the important pathological features of solid tumors, which is closely related to the radiochemotherapy tolerance and poor prognosis. Cinnamaldehyde is extracted from Cinnamomum cassia with inhibiting effect against kinds of tumors. In this study, we demonstrated that hypoxia reduced the sensitivity to oxaliplatin in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells via inducing EMT and stemness. Nonetheless, cinnamaldehyde increased the curative effect of oxaliplatin by promoting apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, cinnamaldehyde and oxaliplatin synergistically reversed hypoxia-induced EMT and stemness of CRC cells and suppressed hypoxia-activated Wnt/beta-catenin pathway synergistically. These consequences uncovered the potential therapeutic value of cinnamaldehyde and provided novel ideas on improving the sensitivity of oxaliplatin in CRC therapy.	cinnamaldehyde colorectal cancer
2	Acute abrin poisoning treated with continuous renal replacement therapy and hemoperfusion successfully: A case report.RATIONALE: Abrin is a highly toxic protein obtained from the seeds of Abrus precatorius, but poisoning due to ingestion of A precatorius is extremely rare in China. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 16-year-old girl, perfectly healthy before, was admitted to the department of gastroenterology owing to intentional ingestion of 10 crushed A precatorius seeds, with multiple episodes of somnolent and anxious mental status, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, hematochezia, and hematuria. DIAGNOSIS: Acute abrin poisoning. INTERVENTIONS: We immediately took effective measures including gastric lavage, purgation, gastric acid suppression by proton pump inhibitor (PPI), liver protection, hemostasis, blood volume and electrolytes resuscitation, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and hemoperfusion (HP). OUTCOMES: Her unwell mental status was improved to the point at which she became conscious and relaxed. The symptoms of vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, hematochezia, and hematuria disappeared gradually. The girl eventually made an excellent recovery with no complications at her 3-month follow-up. LESSONS: The combination of CRRT and HP is an efficient measure in the treatment of abrin poisoning for which there is no specific antidote. This is the first reported case of an abrin poisoning patient successfully treated by CRRT plus HP. Our experience will be useful to other physicians in managing patients of acute abrin poisoning in the future.	abrus precatorius poisoning
1	Inter-strains comparison of the antimicrobial effect and mode of action of a Vietnamese Cinnamomum cassia essential oil from leaves and its principal component against Listeria monocytogenes.The antibacterial activity of a Cinnamomum essential oil and of its main component trans-cinnamaldehyde (90% w/w) was examined against 5 Listeria monocytogenes strains. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of C. cassia essential oil against the 5 L. monocytogenes strains were identical (250 microg.mL-1 ) while the minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) ranged between 800 and 1200 microg.mL-1 . In order to study if this essential oil and trans-cinnamaldehyde altered the 5 strains at the membrane level, fluorescence anisotropy of 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) was measured in presence of different concentrations (1/2MIC, MIC, 2MIC) of these antibacterial agents. A concentration dependent increase of fluorescence anisotropy of DPH in their presence reflecting a rigidification of the membrane was observed for the 5 strains. This modification of the membrane fluidity was associated with a perturbation of the selective membrane permeability, as a perturbation of the gradient between intracellular and extracellular pH was also observed.	c. cassia essential oil
3	Cinnamaldehyde inhibits inflammation of human synoviocyte cells through regulation of Jak/Stat pathway and ameliorates collagen-induced arthritis in rats.Cinnamaldehyde (Cin), a bioactive cinnamon essential oil from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) herb Cinnamomum cassia, has been reported to have multi-pharmacological activities including anti-inflammation. However, its role and molecular mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity in musculoskeletal tissues remains unclear. Here, we first investigated the effects and molecular mechanisms of Cin in human synoviocyte cells. Then in vivo therapeutic effect of Cin on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) also studied. Cell cytotoxicity was measured by CCK-8 Assay. Pro-inflammatory cytokine expression was evaluated using qPCR and ELISA. Protein expression was measured by western blotting. The in vivo effect of Cin (75 mg/kg/day) was evaluated in rats with CIA by gavage administration. Disease progression was assessed by clinical scoring, radiographic, and histological examinations. Cin significantly inhibited IL-1beta-induced interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) release from human synoviocyte cells. The molecular analysis revealed that Cin impaired IL-6-induced janus kinase 2 (JAK2), signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT3 signaling pathway by inhibiting the phosphorylation of JAK2, STAT1 and STAT3, without affecting NF-kappaB pathway. Cin reduced collagen-induced swollen paw volume of arthritic rats. The anti-inflammation effects of Cin were associated with decreased severity of arthritis, joint swelling, and reduced bone erosion and destruction. Furthermore, serum IL-6 level was decreased when Cin administered therapeutically to CIA rats. Cin suppresses IL-1beta-induced inflammation in synoviocytes through the JAK/STAT pathway and alleviated collagen-induced arthritis in rats. These data indicated that Cin might be a potential TCM-derived disease modifying anti-rheumatic herbal drug. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Cin suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion in RA synoviocyte cells by JAK/STAT pathway. Cin ameliorates collagen-induced arthritis in rats. Cin is a potential TCM-derived disease modifying anti-rheumatic herbal drug.	Cin arthritis
0	Cinnamaldehyde induces cell apoptosis mediated by a novel circular RNA hsa_circ_0043256 in non-small cell lung cancer.Cinnamaldehyde (CA), the primary chemical component of the Chinese traditional herb Cinnamomum cassia, is an effective cytotoxic agent against various human cancers. Our previous study indicated that CA could trigger apoptosis in three kinds of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. However, CA mechanism of action in NSCLC has not been unveiled completely. Herein, we showed that a novel circular RNA hsa_circ_0043256 was upregulated in NSCLC cells in response to CA treatment, as detected by microarray and real-time PCR. Hsa_circ_0043256 could inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis, while hsa_circ_0043256 knock-down could promote cell proliferation and restrain apoptosis induced by CA. Bioinformatics analysis predicted that hsa_circ_0043256 could work as a miR-1252 sponge, which could in turn directly target a vital negative regulator of Canonical Wnt signaling, Itchy E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (ITCH), as validated by dual-luciferase assay. Western blot results further confirmed that hsa_circ_0043256 could upregulate ITCH expression, whereas miR-1252 could partially abolish this effect. Interestingly, hsa_circ_0043256 knock-down could weaken Wnt/beta-catenin pathway inhibition induced by CA. Finally, we discovered that CA induced apoptosis and meanwhile upregulated hsa_circ_0043256 expression in vivo. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that ITCH expression was positively association with hsa_circ_0043256 levels. Above all, we characterized a new mechanism mediated by hsa_circ_0043256/miR-1252/ITCH axis in CA function against NSCLC, providing a novel insight into lung cancer therapy.	Cinnamaldehyde ITCH

2	Zizyphus jujuba protects against ibuprofen-induced nephrotoxicity in rats.CONTEXT: Zizyphus jujuba Mill. (Rhamnaceae) has long been used for the treatment of anxiety and insomnia in Chinese traditional medicine. The edible part is the fruit. Different parts of Z. jujuba possess medicinal properties such as anti-inflammatory, anticancer and antifertility. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the therapeutic effect of Z. jujuba fruit aqueous extract (ZE) on nephrotoxicity induced by ibuprofen (IBP) in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were grouped as normal saline (control), ZE (500 mg/kg), IBP (400 mg/kg) and ZE + IBP-treated groups. After five days of oral administration, rats were sacrificed. The protective effect of ZE was evaluated by measuring kidney biomarkers, and histopathological changes of kidney were observed. Kidney antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and lipid peroxidase were investigated. RESULTS: Administration of IBP resulted in a significant increase in urea and creatinine (p &lt; 0.05) and a significant decrease in albumin and total protein (p &lt; 0.05). Damage in glomeruli and proximal convoluted tubules was observed. IBP also increased CAT (p &lt; 0.05) and GST (p &lt; 0.001) activities compared to the control group. Administration of ZE with IBP significantly decreased serum urea and creatinine (p &lt; 0.05) and reduced the severity of kidney damage. There was also a significant increase in the activities of CAT (p &lt; 0.05) and GST (p &lt; 0.001). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: These results indicated that Z. jujuba aqueous extract could have a therapeutic role in reducing nephrotoxicity induced by ibuprofen.	z. jujuba nephrotoxicity
1	Imaging cell wall architecture in single Zinnia elegans tracheary elements.The chemical and structural organization of the plant cell wall was examined in Zinnia elegans tracheary elements (TEs), which specialize by developing prominent secondary wall thickenings underlying the primary wall during xylogenesis in vitro. Three imaging platforms were used in conjunction with chemical extraction of wall components to investigate the composition and structure of single Zinnia TEs. Using fluorescence microscopy with a green fluorescent protein-tagged Clostridium thermocellum family 3 carbohydrate-binding module specific for crystalline cellulose, we found that cellulose accessibility and binding in TEs increased significantly following an acidified chlorite treatment. Examination of chemical composition by synchrotron radiation-based Fourier-transform infrared spectromicroscopy indicated a loss of lignin and a modest loss of other polysaccharides in treated TEs. Atomic force microscopy was used to extensively characterize the topography of cell wall surfaces in TEs, revealing an outer granular matrix covering the underlying meshwork of cellulose fibrils. The internal organization of TEs was determined using secondary wall fragments generated by sonication. Atomic force microscopy revealed that the resulting rings, spirals, and reticulate structures were composed of fibrils arranged in parallel. Based on these combined results, we generated an architectural model of Zinnia TEs composed of three layers: an outermost granular layer, a middle primary wall composed of a meshwork of cellulose fibrils, and inner secondary wall thickenings containing parallel cellulose fibrils. In addition to insights in plant biology, studies using Zinnia TEs could prove especially productive in assessing cell wall responses to enzymatic and microbial degradation, thus aiding current efforts in lignocellulosic biofuel production.	zinnia elegans lignin
2	Zanthoxylum usambarense (Engl.) Kokwaro (Rutaceae) extracts inhibit the growth of the breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, but not the brain tumour cell line U251 in vitro.Zanthoxylum usambarense (Engl.) Kokwaro has traditionally been used for the treatment of malaria, upper respiratory tract infections, cough, rheumatism, tooth decay and sore gums in Kenya and other African countries. Dried ground parts of Z. usambarense were extracted by maceration using methanol (MeOH) at room temperature, extract was dried and reconstituted in 70% aq. MeOH and partitioned against n-hexane and chloroform (CHCl3 ) to obtain MeOH, n-hexane and CHCl3 extracts. All extracts were assessed for cytotoxicity against two breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, and the brain tumour cell line U251 by the MTT assay. The free-radical scavenging activity of the extracts was also determined by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryhydrazyl (DPPH) assay. In the DPPH assay, the MeOH extract was found to be the most active free-radical scavenger with a RC50 value of 41.1 x 10(-3)  mg/mL. It also displayed significant cytotoxicity against the MCF-7 cell line (IC50 42.9 microg/mL) and appeared to have induced cell death through apoptosis. None of the test extracts showed any activity against the U251 cell line at test concentrations. The present findings demonstrated that Z. usambarense could be a potential source for new cytotoxic compounds for possible anticancer drug development.	z. usambarense brain tumour

2	Hypoglycemic effects of three Iranian edible plants; jujube, barberry and saffron: Correlation with serum adiponectin level.One of the most common disorders of the endocrine system is diabetes mellitus. This disease is associated with dyslipidemia. Adiponectin is a protein hormone that secreted by adipocytes and has an important role in regulating of glucose and fatty acid metabolic pathways. This study was designed to investigate the changes in serum level of adiponectin in diabetic rats treated with hydroalcoholic extracts of three medicinal plants; jujube (Ziziphus jujuba), barberry (Berberis vulgaris) and saffron (Crocus sativus) in comparison with quercetin. Streptozotocin -induced diabetic male rats were gavaged with specified doses of the extracts (25 and 100mg/kg) for two weeks. At the end of treatment period, fasting blood specimens were collected. The levels of adiponectin, fasting blood sugar (FBS), total Cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-C and LDL-C were measured. Statistical analysis showed that serum levels of triglyceride and VLDL decreased significantly (P&lt;0.05) in all treated groups. FBS level in all treated groups, decreased significantly and reach to normoglycemic level (P&lt;0.05). Except Jujube, other plant extracts had no effect on cholesterol. Jujube in two doses (25 and 100mg/kg) could increased significantly HDL-C (P&lt;0.05) with no effect on total cholesterol and LDL-C. Serum adiponectin level increased in all treated groups. These beneficial effects of C. sativus, B. vulgaris and Z. jujube extracts and quercetin in diabetic rats may be associated with increase in adiponectin level. 	c. sativus diabetic
2	The ability of an ethanol extract of Cinnamomum cassia to inhibit Src and spleen tyrosine kinase activity contributes to its anti-inflammatory action.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Cinnamomum cassia Blume (Aceraceae) has been traditionally used to treat various inflammatory diseases such as gastritis. However, the anti-inflammatory mechanism of Cinnamomum cassia has not been fully elucidated. This study examined the anti-inflammatory mechanism of 95% ethanol extract (Cc-EE) of Cinnamomum cassia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effect of Cc-EE on the production of inflammatory mediators in RAW264.7 cells and peritoneal macrophages was investigated. Molecular mechanisms underlying the effects, especially inhibitory effects, was elucidated by analyzing the activation of transcription factors and their upstream signaling, and by evaluating the kinase activity of target enzymes. RESULTS: Cc-EE of Cinnamomum cassia diminished the production of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and prostaglandin (PG)E(2), in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated RAW264.7 cells and peritoneal macrophages in a dose-dependent manner. Cc-EE also blocked mRNA expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, and TNF-alpha by suppressing the activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, and simultaneously inhibited its upstream inflammatory signaling cascades, including spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and Src. Consistent with these findings, the extract directly blocked the kinase activities of Src and Syk. CONCLUSION: Cc-EE exerts strong anti-inflammatory activity by suppressing Src/Syk-mediated NF-kappaB activation, which contributes to its major ethno-pharmacological role as an anti-gastritis remedy. Future work will be focused on determining whether the extract can be further developed as an anti-inflammatory drug.	cinnamomum cassia tumor necrosis

CONCLUSION: Normelicopidine was the most active against PC-3M, LNCaP and Dd2 with IC50 values of 12.5, 21.1, and 18.9 ug/mL respectively.	acridone alkaloids prostate cancer
2	Safety assessment of Zanthoxylum alatum Roxb. essential oil, its antifungal, antiaflatoxin, antioxidant activity and efficacy as antimicrobial in preservation of Piper nigrum L. fruits.The investigation deals with antifungal, antiaflatoxin and antioxidant efficacy of Zanthoxylum alatum Roxb. essential oil (EO), its two major constituents and their comparison with five commonly used organic acid preservatives. The chemical profile of EO, characterized through GC and GC-MS analysis, revealed linalool (56.10%) and methyl cinnamate (19.73%) as major components. The EO, linalool and methyl cinnamate completely inhibited the growth of a toxigenic strain of A. flavus (LHP-10) as well as aflatoxin B(1) secretion at different concentrations. Methyl cinnamate was found to be more efficacious than EO, linalool and five organic acid preservatives, showing antifungal and antiaflatoxigenic efficacy at a low concentration (0.6 mul/ml) and the nature of its toxicity was fungicidal. However, EO showed strong antioxidant activity with an IC(50) value at 5.6 mul/ml. Moreover, EO was found to have negligible mammalian toxicity as its LD(50) value, determined through oral administration on mice, was calculated to be 6124mul/kg body weight during safety profile assessment. During in vivo investigation on fruit systems, the Zanthoxylum EO, when tested as fumigant, provided 66.27% and 86.33% protection respectively at 1.25 mul/ml and 2.5 mul/ml against fungi infesting Piper nigrum L. fruits demonstrating its practical efficacy as a plant based antimicrobial for post harvest application.	piper nigrum l toxicity

2	Antiproliferation of melanoma cells by polysaccharide isolated from Zizyphus jujuba.OBJECTIVE: Zizyphus jujuba, a traditional Chinese herb rich in functional components such as polysaccharide, has been widely consumed in Asian countries. The objective of this study was to determine the antiproliferation effect of melanoma cells as affected by deproteinized polysaccharide (DPP) isolated from Z. jujuba. METHODS: Deproteinized polysaccharide was obtained through boiling water extraction, ethanol precipitation, deproteinization, and dialysis, and the molecular weight of DPP was determined by high-performance gel-filtration chromatography. Melanoma cell viability was assessed by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, the cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry, the formation of apoptotic bodies was observed under a fluorescence microscope at 450 nm, and caspase-3 and caspase-9 were measured by an assay kit. RESULTS: Deproteinized polysaccharide was composed of two fractions with average molecular weights of 143 108 and 67 633 Da. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide test showed that the antiproliferation effect of DPP on melanoma cells followed a dose- and time-dependent course. The 50% inhibitory concentration of DPP in inhibiting melanoma cell growth was 3.99 +- 0.10 mg/mL after 24-h treatment but decreased significantly to 3.36 +- 0.14 mg/mL after 48 h. The cell cycle assay revealed melanoma cells to be arrested in G2/M phase. Moreover, with DPP treatment, the apoptotic bodies were generated, accompanied by an increase in caspase-3 and caspase-9 activity. CONCLUSIONS: This outcome suggested that DPP may be used as a potential anti-skin cancer agent for further in vivo and clinical trial experiments.	z. jujuba melanoma

1	Effects of water-soluble carbohydrate concentrate from Chinese jujube on different intestinal and fecal indices.This study was to investigate the effects of water-soluble carbohydrate concentrate (WSCC) prepared from Chinese jujube ( Zizyphus jujuba) on different intestinal and fecal indices in a hamster model. WSCC contained carbohydrates (771 g kg(-1) of WSCC) including glucose, fructose, pectin polysaccharide, and hemicellulose. The administration of WSCC (5.0 and 15 g kg(-1) of diet) effectively ( P&lt;0.05) shortened gastrointestinal transit time (by 34.2-57.3%), reduced cecal ammonia (by 58.1-60.3%), elevated total short-chain fatty acid concentrations in cecum (3-4-fold), increased fecal moisture (147-170%), reduced daily fecal ammonia output (by 31.9-75.8%), and decreased the activities of beta-D-glucuronidase (by 73.0-73.8%), beta-D-glucosidase (by 58.2-85.7%), mucinase (by 46.2-72.6%), and urease (by 31.9-48.7%) in feces. This study suggested that adequate consumption of jujube WSCC (at least 5.0 g kg(-1) of diet or 40 mg day(-1)) might exert favorable effects on improving the gastrointestinal milieu and reducing the exposure of intestinal mucosa to toxic ammonia and other detrimental compounds.	jujube hemicellulose
1	The essential oil from the twigs of Cinnamomum cassia Presl inhibits oxytocin-induced uterine contraction in vitro and in vivo.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The twigs and bark of Cinnamomum cassia Presl (Lauraceae) are widely used in traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of tumor, abdominal pain, dysmenorrhea, digestive system disease and inflammatory diseases. The aim of this study was to determine the inhibitory effect of the essential oil from the twigs of Cinnamomum cassia Presl (EOCC) on uterine contraction in vitro and in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mouse uterine contraction was induced by oxytocin (OT) exposure following estradiol benzoate pretreatment. Mice were given the EOCC (60, 30, and 15mg/kg) by gavage. The level of prostaglandin F2alpha (PGF2alpha) in uterine tissue were determined according to specification of enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. Uterine tissue was collected for histopathological analysis (H&amp;E). Myosin light chain 20 (MLC20), phosphorylation of myosin light chain 20 (p-MLC20) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) proteins in uterine tissue were assessed by Western Blot. Mouse isolated uterus strips were mounted in tissue organ baths containing Locke's solution. The contractile responses were recorded with Power Lab recording system. The effect of the EOCC on uterine contraction induced by OT, PGF2alpha, and acetylcholine (Ach) was observed. Myometrial cells were exposed to OT (7muM) to induce Ca2+ release, and the effect of the EOCC (100, 50, and 25mug/ml) on intracellular Ca2+ was analysed with fluorometry imaging. RESULTS: In vivo study demonstrated that the EOCC significantly reduced OT-induced writhing responses with a maximal inhibition of 66.5%. It also decreased the level of PGF2alpha in OT-induced mice uterine tissue. Moreover, Western blot analysis showed that COX-2 and p-MLC20 expressions in uterine tissue of dysmenorrhea mice were significantly reduced. EOCC inhibited spontaneous uterus contractions in a dose-dependent manner, and the concentration of the EOCC giving 50% of maximal contraction (IC50) value was 61.3mug/ml. The IC50 values of the EOCC on OT, PGF2alpha, and Ach-induced contractions were 113.0mug/ml, 94.7mug/ml, and 61.5mug/ml, respectively. Further in vitro studies indicated that the EOCC could restrain intracellular Ca2+ levels in favour of uterine relaxation.

1	New triterpenoids from the leaves of Abrus precatorius.Three new (1-3) triterpenoids and one known (4) triterpenoid were isolated from an acid hydrolyzed methanol-soluble extract of the leaves of Abrus precatorius. Their structures were identified as (20S,22S)-3beta,22-dihydroxycucurbita-5(10),24-diene-26,29-dioic acid delta-lactone (1), 3-O-[6'-methyl-beta-D-glucuronopyranosyl]-3beta,22beta-dihydroxyolean-12-en-29-oic acid methyl ester (2), 3-O-beta-D-glucuronopyranosylsophoradiol methyl ester (3), and sophoradiol (4) by spectroscopic techniques including 2D NMR.	abrus precatorius triterpenoids
3	A new cytotoxic phenylbutenoid dimer from the rhizomes of Zingiber cassumunar.A new phenylbutenoid dimer, (+/-)- trans-3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-4-[(E)-3,4-dimethoxystyryl]cyclohex-1-ene, was isolated from the rhizomes of Zingiber cassumunar along with the three known compounds, (+/-)- trans-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-[(E)-3,4-dimethoxystyryl]cyclohex-1-ene, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)but-1,3-diene, and 4-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)but-1,3-diene by bioassay-directed fractionation using the A549 human cancer cell line cytotoxicity assay. Structure of the new compound was elucidated by spectral analysis, including 1D and 2D NMR experiments.	phenylbutenoid cancer
1	Fine root decomposition rates do not mirror those of leaf litter among temperate tree species.Elucidating the function of and patterns among plant traits above ground has been a major research focus, while the patterns and functioning of belowground traits remain less well understood. Even less well known is whether species differences in leaf traits and their associated biogeochemical effects are mirrored by differences in root traits and their effects. We studied fine root decomposition and N dynamics in a common garden study of 11 temperate European and North American tree species (Abies alba, Acer platanoides, Acer pseudoplatanus, Carpinus betulus, Fagus sylvatica, Larix decidua, Picea abies, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Quercus robur, Quercus rubra and Tilia cordata) to determine whether leaf litter and fine root decomposition rates are correlated across species as well as which species traits influence microbial decomposition above versus below ground. Decomposition and N immobilization rates of fine roots were unrelated to those of leaf litter across species. The lack of correspondence of above- and belowground processes arose partly because the tissue traits that influenced decomposition and detritus N dynamics different for roots versus leaves, and partly because influential traits were unrelated between roots and leaves across species. For example, while high hemicellulose concentrations and thinner roots were associated with more rapid decomposition below ground, low lignin and high Ca concentrations were associated with rapid aboveground leaf decomposition. Our study suggests that among these temperate trees, species effects on C and N dynamics in decomposing fine roots and leaf litter may not reinforce each other. Thus, species differences in rates of microbially mediated decomposition may not be as large as they would be if above- and belowground processes were working in similar directions (i.e., if faster decomposition above ground corresponded to faster decomposition below ground). Our results imply that studies that focus solely on aboveground traits may obscure some of the important mechanisms by which plant species influence ecosystem processes.	abies alba hemicellulose
1	Chemical composition and antibacterial activity of the essential oil from green huajiao (Zanthoxylum schinifolium) against selected foodborne pathogens.Green huajiao, which is the ripe pericarp of the fruit of Zanthoxylum schinifolium Sieb. et Zucc, is widely consumed in Asia as a spice. In this work, the chemical composition of the essential oil from green huajiao was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) and GC/mass spectrometry (MS), and the majority of components were identified. Linalool (28.2%), limonene (13.2%), and sabinene (12.1%) were found to be the major components. The antibacterial activity, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the essential oil were evaluated against selected bacteria, including food-borne pathogens. The results showed that the sensitivities to the essential oil were different for different bacteria tested, and the susceptibility of Gram-positive bacteria tested was observed to be greater than that of Gram-negative bacteria. The antibacterial activity of the essential oil was particularly strong against Staphylococcus epidermidis , with MIC and MBC values of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/mL, respectively. A postcontact effect assay also confirmed the essential oil had a significant effect on the growth rate of surviving S. epidermidis . The antibacterial activity of the essential oil from green huajiao may be due to the increase in permeability of cell membranes, and the leakage of intracellular constituents, on the basis of the cell constituents' release assay and electron microscopy observations. 	zanthoxylum schinifolium Linalool
1	Three new pterocarpans from the aerial parts of Abrus Precatorius.Three new pterocarpans, named abrusprecatins A-C (1-3), along with three known ones, namely medicarpin (4), maackiain (5), and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-8,9-methylenedioxypterocarpan (6) were isolated from the aerial parts of Abrus precatorius. The structures of these compounds were established by extensive analysis of mass spectrometric data, 1 D and 2 D NMR spectroscopic data. In addition, the absolute configurations were determined by a combination of single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis and circular dichroism spectroscopy.	abrus precatorius medicarpin
1	Structures of new phenylbutanoids and nitric oxide production inhibitors from the rhizomes of Zingiber cassumunar.The methanolic (MeOH) extract from the rhizomes of Zingiber cassumunar showed nitric oxide (NO) production inhibitory effects induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mouse peritoneal macrophages. From the MeOH extract, six new phenylbutanoids, phlains I-VI, were isolated together with 16 known constituents. The structures of new phenylbutanoids were determined on the basis of physicochemical and chemical evidence. In addition, the inhibitory effects of the principal constituents on the NO production were examined. Among them, phlain III (IC50=24 microM), (E)-1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)buta-1,3-diene (69 microM), (E)-1-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)buta-1,3-diene (83 microM), and cassumunaquinone 1 (47 microM) were found to show the inhibitory effects.	zingiber cassumunar phenylbutanoids
3	Apoptogenic activity of auraptene of Zanthoxylum schinifolium toward human acute leukemia Jurkat T cells is associated with ER stress-mediated caspase-8 activation that stimulates mitochondria-dependent or -independent caspase cascade.To isolate pharmacologically safe compounds that can induce apoptosis of tumor cells, leaves of an aromatic plant (Zanthoxylum schinifolium), which are widely used as a food flavor and herbal medicine in Korea and Japan, were sequentially extracted by organic solvents. An apoptogenic ingredient in the methylene chloride extract was further purified by silica gel column chromatography and identified as auraptene (AUR). The IC(50) value of AUR against Jurkat T cells was 16.5 microg/ml. After the treatment of Jurkat T cells with AUR, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated activation of caspase-12 and -8 and subsequent apoptotic events including c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, cleavage of FLICE inhibitory protein and Bid, mitochondrial cytochrome c release, activation of caspase-9 and -3, degradation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and apoptotic DNA fragmentation were induced in a dose-dependent manner. The cytotoxicity of AUR was not blocked by the anti-Fas neutralizing antibody ZB-4. The AUR-induced cytotoxicity and apoptotic events were abrogated by ectopic over-expression of Bcl-xL or addition of the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. The individual or simultaneous addition of the m-calpain inhibitor (E64d), JNK inhibitor (SP600125) and mitochondrial permeability transition pore inhibitor (CsA) failed to prevent apoptotic events including caspase-8 activation and Bid cleavage, unless the caspase-8 inhibitor (z-IETD-fmk) was combined, whereas AUR-induced caspase-12 activation was sustained even in the concomitant presence of z-IETD-fmk. These results demonstrated that the apoptotic effect of AUR on Jurkat T cells was exerted by the ER stress-mediated activation of caspase-8, and the subsequent induction of mitochondria-dependent or -independent activation of caspase cascade, which could be suppressed by Bcl-xL.

1	Cinnamaldehyde/chemotherapeutic agents interaction and drug-metabolizing genes in colorectal cancer.Cinnamaldehyde is an active monomer isolated from the stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia, a traditional oriental medicinal herb, which is known to possess marked antitumor effects in vitro and in vivo. The aim of the present study was to examine the potential advantages of using cinnamaldehyde in combination with chemotherapeutic agents commonly used in colorectal carcinoma (CRC) therapy, as well as to investigate the effect of cinnamaldehyde on chemotherapeutic-associated gene expression. The synergistic interaction of cinnamaldehyde and chemotherapeutic agents on human CRC HT-29 and LoVo cells was evaluated using the combination index (CI) method. The double staining with Annexin V conjugated to fluorescein-isothiocyanate and phosphatidylserine was employed for apoptosis detection. The expression of drug-metabolizing genes, including excision repair cross-complementing 1 (ERCC1), orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRT), thymidylate synthase (TS), breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1) and topoisomerase 1 (TOPO1), all in HT-29 and LoVo cells, with or without the addition of cinnamaldehyde, was examined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Cinnamaldehyde had a synergistic effect on the chemotherapeutic agents cytotoxicity in HT-29 and LoVo cells. In addition, cinnamaldehyde suppressed BRCA1, TOPO1, ERCC1 and TS mRNA expression, except for OPRT expression, which was markedly upregulated. Our findings indicate that cinnamaldehyde appears to be a promising candidate as an adjuvant in combination therapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and oxaliplatin (OXA), two chemotherapeutic agents used in CRC treatment. The possible mechanisms of its action may involve the regulation of drug-metabolizing genes.	cinnamomum cassia cinnamaldehyde
2	Identification of three competitive inhibitors for membrane-associated, Mg2+-dependent and neutral 60 kDa sphingomyelinase activity.Methanol extracts of domestic plants of Korea were evaluated as a potential inhibitor of neutral pH optimum and membrane-associated 60 kDa sphingomyelinase (N-SMase) activity. In this study, we partially purified N-SMase from bovine brain membranes using ammonium sulfate. It was purified approximately 163-fold by the sequential use of DE52, Butyl-Toyopearl, DEAE-Cellulose, and Phenyl-5PW column chromatographies. The purified N-SMase activity was assayed in the presence of the plant extracts of three hundreds species. Based on the in vitro assay, three plant extracts significantly inhibited the N-SMase activity in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. To further examine the inhibitory pattern, a Dixon plot was constructed for each of the plant extracts. The extracts of Abies nephrolepis, Acer tegmentosum, and Ginkgo biloba revealed a competitive inhibition with the inhibition constant (Ki) of 11.9 microg/ mL, 9.4 microg/mL, and 12.9 microg/mL, respectively. These extracts also inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the production of ceramide induced by serum deprivation in human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y.	abies nephrolepis neuroblastoma
1	In vitro antimicrobial activity of Zingiber cassumunar (Plai) oil and a 5% Plai oil gel.The essential oil of Zingiber cassumunar (Plai oil) exhibits antimicrobial activity against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, dermatophytes and yeasts. Dermatophytes were found to be the most susceptible microorganisms followed by yeasts, whereas bacteria were the least susceptible. The mean diameter of the inhibition zone determined by the disc diffusion screening method increased with increasing Plai oil concentration between 6.25 and 50 vol %. The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) determined by the broth macrodilution method ranged from 0.62 to 2.5 vol % for Plai oil and from 52 to 79 mg/mL for the 5 wt % Plai oil gel, whereas the minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) ranged from 0.31 to 1.25 vol % for Plai oil and from 13.8 to 39.5 mg/mL for the 5% Plai oil gel.	zingiber cassumunar essential oil
1	[AMWFA method applied to research on changes of essential components and extractive ratioes of herbal pair Cinnamomum cassia and Poria cocos].Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, chemometric resolution method-Alternative movingwindow factor analysis that were proposed recently and the Kovats retention index were used to analyze the essential components of herbal pair Cinnamomum cassia Presl and Poria cocos (CCP-PC) and compare them with those of single herbal Cinnamomum cassia Presl (CCP). 46 and 42 essential components in essential oil of CCP and CCP-PC have been identified individually. Results shows that the number of essential components of CCP and CCP-PC were almost the same, but extractive ratioes of them have changed significantly, some of them were increased obviously, most of them were declined notably instead and even several ingredients of CCP-PC were disappeared due to CCP PC's interaction probably. The main pharmacodynamic ingredients of CCP-PC, 3-phenyl-2-propenal and Cinnamaldehyde were obviously higher contents than that of single CCP. It suggested that there exist certain interactions of the chemical ingredients in compound medicine rather than their sum effect of single medicines. There is a litter difference in quality and quantity between single medicines and pair medicines, so the application of pair medicines can expand single medicine's adaptive disease and has a good clinical referenced valuation.	poria cocos Cinnamaldehyde
1	Structural characterization of polysaccharides from Zizyphus jujuba and evaluation of antioxidant activity.Fruit of Zizyphus jujuba Mill, a traditional Chinese herb widely consumed in Asian countries, has been reported to possess several vital biological activities. This study intends to develop an appropriate analytical method for isolation of polysaccharides from Z. jujuba fruits and evaluate their antioxidant activity. Initially, powdered Z. jujuba fruits were subjected to hot water extraction, followed by ethanol precipitation, deproteination, dialysis and fractionation in a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column. One neutral polysaccharide fraction (ZJPN) and 3 acidic polysaccharide fractions (ZJPa1, ZJPa2 and ZJPa3) were isolated with the average MW ranging from 40,566 to 129,518 Da. GC analysis revealed that 6 monosaccharides, namely, rhamnose, arabinose, xylose, mannose, glucose and galactose were present in polysaccharide fractions. The galacturonic acid content in polysaccharide fractions followed the order: ZJPa3&gt;ZJPa2&gt;ZJPa1&gt;ZJPN. All the 4 polysaccharide fractions were found to be more effective in scavenging superoxide anions than hydroxyl radicals, while acidic polysaccharides showed a more pronounced effect in chelating ferrous ion.	z. jujuba polysaccharides
2	The inhibitory effect of plant extracts on the collagenolytic activity and cytotoxicity of human gingival fibroblasts by Porphyromonas gingivalis crude enzyme.It is well known that plant extracts inhibit some enzymatic activities. The present study examined the inhibitory effects of natural plant extracts against the collagenolytic activity of Porphyromonas gingivalis. The enzyme was isolated from a culture supernatant of P. gingivalis 381. The aqueous and 50% ethanolic extracts of Ginkgo biloba, Mosla chinensis, Salvia officinalis, Cinnamomum cassia, and a catechin extract of Camellia sinensis exhibited strong inhibitory effects on collagenolytic activity. The activities of these plant extracts were higher than that of tetracycline-HCl. They also inhibited the cytotoxicity of P. gingivalis crude enzyme against human gingival fibroblasts. C. sinensis catechin was the most effective agent in neutralizing the cytotoxicity of P. gingivalis. The aqueous and 50% ethanolic extracts of C. cassia had relatively strong anti-cytotoxic activity. Although the other samples strongly inhibited the collagenolytic activity of P. gingivalis, they were not effectively anti-cytotoxic. The present findings suggest that C. sinensis and C. cassia extracts are effective in reducing the pathogenicity of periodontopathic bacteria.	c. cassia periodontopathic bacteria
3	Apoptosis induction of 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde as a proteasome inhibitor is associated with ER stress and mitochondrial perturbation in cancer cells.2'-Hydroxycinnamaldehyde (HCA), isolated from the stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia, and 2'-benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde (BCA), one of HCA derivatives, have antiproliferative activities on several human cancer cell lines. Our previous study suggested that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and caspase-3 are the major regulators of HCA-induced apoptosis. In the present study, we demonstrated a novel molecular target using in vitro pull-down assay by biotin-labeled HCA (biotin-HCA) in SW620 cells. We analyzed 11 differential spots of 2-dimensional gel prepared with pull-downed proteins by biotin-HCA. Among them, five spots were identified as proteasome subunits. An in vitro 26S proteasome function assay using specific fluorogenic substrates showed that HCA potently inhibits L3-like activity of the proteasome. In addition, HCA showed inhibitory action against chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and PGPH-like activities. DNA microarray showed that HCA induced heat shock family and ER stress-responsive genes, which reflects the accumulation of misfolded proteins by proteasome inhibition. On western blot analysis, it was confirmed that HCA induces glucose-regulated protein, 78 kDa (GRP78) and some representative endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-responsive proteins. Furthermore, HCA treatment decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. The effect of HCA on cytochrome c and Bax translocation between cytosol and mitochondrial membrane was clarified using western blot analysis. These results suggest that HCA-induced apoptosis is associated with the inhibition of the proteasome activity that leads in turn to the increase of ER stress and mitochondrial perturbation.	2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde cancer

1	The Effect of Plant Additives on the Stability of Polyphenols in Dried Black Chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa) Fruit.Chokeberry fruit exhibits a high level of pro-health potential, associated with a significant amount of polyphenol content and antioxidant activity. The fruit is easily perishable and therefore needs to be processed in short order to ensure its availability throughout the year. For this purpose, the fruit is dried, which has an impact on the preservation of bioactive components such as polyphenols. In the study, chokeberry fruit was influenced by a suspension of spices, including clove and cinnamon, and subsequently dried using the freeze-drying, convection, and microwave radiation methods. Freeze-drying was concluded to be the most desirable method of drying, which preserves the largest amount of polyphenols while soaking fruit in a suspension of cinnamon or cloves accelerated the loss of anthocyanins during the storage period. The obtained test results may constitute a valuable source of information for manufacturers in designing new products with increased pro-health potential, whose properties result from the high content of polyphenols and other plant additives.	cloves polyphenols
1	Protective effect of total flavonoid C-glycosides from Abrus mollis extract on lipopolysaccharide-induced lipotoxicity in mice.Abrus mollis is a widely used traditional Chinese medicine for treating acute and chronic hepatitis, steatosis, and fibrosis. It was found that the total flavonoid C-glycosides from Abrus mollis extract (AME) showed potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and hepatoprotective activities. To further investigate the hepatoprotective effect of AME and its possible mechanisms, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced liver injury models were applied in the current study. The results indicated that AME significantly attenuated LPS-induced lipid accumulation in mouse primary hepatocytes as measured by triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) assays and Oil Red O staining. Meanwhile, AME exerted a protective effect on LPS-induced liver injury as shown by decreased liver index, serum aminotransferase levels, and hepatic lipid accumulation. Real-time PCR and immunoblot data suggested that AME reversed the LPS-mediated lipid metabolism gene expression, such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1). In addition, LPS-induced overexpression of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), X-box-binding protein-1 (XBP-1), and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) were dramatically reversed by AME. Furthermore, AME also decreased the expression of LPS-enhanced interleukin-6 (IL-6) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Here, it is demonstrated for the first time that AME ameliorated LPS-induced hepatic lipid accumulation and that this effect of AME can be attributed to its modulation of hepatic de novo fatty acid synthesis. This study also suggested that the hepatoprotective effect of AME may be related to its down-regulation of unfolded protein response (UPR) activation. 	abrus mollis flavonoid c-glycosides
2	Oryeongsan suppressed high glucose-induced mesangial fibrosis.BACKGROUND: The pathological change of kidney in diabetic nephropathy is represented hypertrophy, inflammation, and renal fibrosis. Oryeongsan, traditional oriental herbal formula, is widely used for the treatment of nephrosis, dropsy, and uremia. This study was examined whether Oryeongsan attenuate high-glucose (HG)-promoted rat mesangial cell fibrosis and matrix accumulation, major features of diabetic glomerulosclerosis. METHODS: Oryeongsan was mixed traditional herbal medicine, Alisma orientale Juz, Polyporus umbellatus Fries, Atractylodes macrocephala Koidez, Poria cocos Wolf and Cinnamomum Cassia Presl (5:3:3:1). Renoprotective role in diabetic nephropathy of Oryeongsan was evaluated by [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation, Western blot, RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence microscopy assay. RESULTS: Rat mesangial cell proliferation induced by HG was significantly accelerated, which was inhibited by Oryeongsan in a dose dependent manner. HG enhanced expression of fibrosis biomarkers such as collagen IV and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), which was markedly attenuated by Oryeongsan. Oryeongsan increased HG-inhibited membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase expression (MT1-MMP) and MMP-2 promotor activity, whereas suppressed HG-induced tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) expression. Moreover, Oryeongsan promoted extracellular matrix degradation through disturbing transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta)-Smad signaling. This study further revealed that Oryeongsan ameliorated HG-induced mesangial inflammation accompanying induction of intracellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). Moreover, pretreatment of Oryeongsan inhibited NF-kappaB translocation in HG-exposed mesangial cell. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that Oryeongsan has protective effect against renal proliferation, fibrosis, and inflammation. Therefore Oryeongsan may be specific therapies targeting renal dysfunction leading to diabetic nephropathy.	cinnamomum cassia diabetic nephropathy
1	Cinnamaldehyde induces apoptosis by ROS-mediated mitochondrial permeability transition in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells.Cinnamaldehyde is an active compound isolated from the stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia, a traditional oriental medicinal herb, which has been shown to inhibit tumor cell proliferation. In this study, we investigated the effects of cinnamaldehyde on the cytotoxicity, induction of apoptosis and the putative pathways of its actions in human promyelocytic leukemia cells. Using apoptosis analysis, measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and assessment of mitochondrial membrane potentials (DeltaPsim), we show that cinnamaldehyde is a potent inducer of apoptosis and that it transduces the apoptotic signal via ROS generation, thereby inducing mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) and cytochrome c release to the cytosol. ROS production, mitochondrial alteration, and subsequent apoptotic cell death in cinnamaldehyde-treated cells were blocked by the antioxidant N-acetylcystein. Taken together, our data indicate that cinnamaldehyde induces the ROS-mediated mitochondrial permeability transition and resultant cytochrome c release. This is the first report on the mechanism of the anticancer effect of cinnamaldehyde.	cinnamomum cassia cinnamaldehyde
1	alpha-Amylase inhibitory triterpene from Abrus precatorius leaves.In the screening experiments for porcine pancreatic alpha-amylase inhibitors in 18 plants obtained from Indonesia, a potent inhibitory activity was detected in the extract of leaves of Abrus precatorius. The enzyme assay-guided fractionation of the extract led to the isolation of a triterpene ketone, lupenone (1), as a potent alpha-amylase inhibitor, together with 24-methylenecycloartenone (2) and luteolin (3). The mode of inhibition of compound 1 against porcine pancreatic alpha-amylase was a mixed inhibition. This is the first report that describes the potent alpha-amylase inhibitory activity of the low-polar triterpene ketone similar to compound 1. A comparison of the activities of the isolate and related compounds indicated the importance of C-3 ketone and the lupane skeleton in the alpha-amylase inhibitory activity. 	abrus precatorius lupenone
1	Phenolic content and antioxidant property of the bark extracts of Ziziphus mucronata Willd. subsp. mucronata Willd.BACKGROUND: Several plants traditionally used in treatment of a variety of infections in South Africa are reported in ethnobotanical surveys. Many of these plants including Ziziphus mucronata subsp. mucronata lack scientific reports to support their medicinal importance. METHODS: The antioxidant activities and phenolic contents of the acetone, ethanol and aqueous extracts of the stems of Z. mucronata subsp. mucronata were evaluated using in vitro standard methods. The total phenol, total flavonoids and proanthocyanidin content were determined spectrophotometrically. Quercetin, Tannic acid and catechin equivalents were used for these parameters. The antioxidant activities of the stem bark extracts of this plant were determined by ABTS, DPPH, and ferrous reducing antioxidant property (FRAP) methods. RESULTS: The quantity of the phenolic compounds, flavonoids and proanthocyanidins detected differ significantly in the various extracts. The phenolics were significantly higher than the flavonoids and proanthocyanidin contents in all the extracts investigated. The ferric reducing ability and the radical scavenging activities of the extracts were very high and dose-dependent. The ethanol extract had the highest antioxidant activity, followed by the acetone extract while the aqueous extract was the least active. Reacting with ABTS, the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were (0.0429 +- 0.04 mg/ml) for aqueous, (0.0317 +- 0.04 mg/ml) for acetone and (0.0306 +- 0.04 mg/ml) for ethanol extracts while they inhibited DPPH radical with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 0.0646 +- 0.02 mg/ml (aqueous), 0.0482 +- 0.02 mg/ml (acetone) and 0.0422 +- 0.03 mg/ml (ethanol). CONCLUSIONS: A correlation between the antioxidant activity and the total phenolic contents of the extracts indicated that phenolic compounds were the dominant contributors to the antioxidant activity of the plant. This study, therefore, demonstrated that Z. mucronata subsp. mucronata has strong antioxidant property and free radical scavenging capability.	z. mucronata subsp tannic acid
2	Evaluation of natural products on inhibition of inducible cyclooxygenase (COX-2) and nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in cultured mouse macrophage cells.The inhibitors of prostaglandin biosynthesis and nitric oxide production have been considered as potential anti-inflammatory and cancer chemopreventive agents. In this study, we evaluated approximately 170 methanol extracts of natural products including Korean herbal medicines for the inhibition of prostaglandin E(2) production (for COX-2 inhibitors) and nitric oxide formation (for iNOS inhibitors) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophages RAW264.7 cells. As a result, several extracts such as Aristolochia debilis, Cinnamomum cassia, Cinnamomum loureirii, Curcuma zedoaria, Eugenia caryophyllata, Pterocarpus santalius, Rehmania glutinosa and Tribulus terrestris showed potent inhibition of COX-2 activity (&gt;80% inhibition at the test concentration of 10 micro g/ml). In addition, the extracts of A. debilis, Caesalpinia sappan, Curcuma longa, C. zedoaria, Daphne genkwa and Morus alba were also considered as potential inhibitors of iNOS activity (&gt;70% inhibition at the test concentration of 10 micro g/ml). These active extracts mediating COX-2 and iNOS inhibitory activities are warranted for further elucidation of active principles for development of new cancer chemopreventive and/or anti-inflammatory agents.	curcuma longa cancer
2	The Effects of Cinnamomum Cassia on Blood Glucose Values are Greater than those of Dietary Changes Alone.Eighteen type II diabetics (9 women and 9 men) participated in a 12-week trial that consisted of 2 parts, a 3-week control phase followed by a 9-week experimental phase where half of the subjects received 1000 mg of Cinnamomum cassia while the other half received 1000 mg of a placebo pill. All of the subjects that were in the cinnamon group had a statistically significant decrease in their blood sugar levels with a P-value of 3.915 x 10(-10). The subjects in the cinnamon group had an average overall decrease in their blood sugar levels of about 30 mg/dL, which is comparable to oral medications available for diabetes. All subjects were educated on appropriate diabetic diets and maintained that diet for the entire 12 week study. Greater decreases in blood glucose values were observed in patients using the cinnamon compared to those using the dietary changes alone. 	cinnamon diabetic
3	Acute demyelinating encephalitis after jequirity pea ingestion (Abrus precatorius).INTRODUCTION: Castor and jequirity beans are uncommon causes of poisoning. The more common but less severe castor poisoning is well described, but jequirity bean (Abrus Precatorius) poisoning is rare. The toxicity is attributed to toxalbumins (ricin and abrin) that act by inhibiting protein synthesis. Their use as agents of biological warfare, mechanisms of action, and clinical features of poisoning are summarized. CASE REPORT: A 30-year-old previously healthy female presented with bloody diarrhea and deep coma following ingestion of 3-4 seeds of a plant called 'ratti.' Investigations, including an MRI brain scan, showed evidence of acute demyelinating encephalitis. The patient died three days later due to progressive central nervous system depression. DISCUSSION: This is a previously unreported manifestation of jequirity bean poisoning. Demyelination is immune-mediated, and Abrus is a well-known immuno-modulator and stimulator. A possible immunological pathogenic mechanism is hypothesized.	toxalbumins central nervous system depression
3	Fatal abrin poisoning by injection.Abrin is a toxin of public health concern due to its lethality, lack of antidote, and potential for use as a bioterrorism agent. Possible routes of exposure include ingestion, inhalation, and injection. Onset of symptoms is often delayed, even in severe cases. In fatal cases, death occurs from multi-organ failure. We describe the clinical course, laboratory, and pathologic findings in a case of fatal human poisoning associated with abrin injection. The Abrus precatorius seeds in this case were obtained via the internet. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Laboratory Response Network detected abrine in the urine confirming abrin exposure in this fatal poisoning.	abrine death
1	Apoptosis induction of 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde as a proteasome inhibitor is associated with ER stress and mitochondrial perturbation in cancer cells.2'-Hydroxycinnamaldehyde (HCA), isolated from the stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia, and 2'-benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde (BCA), one of HCA derivatives, have antiproliferative activities on several human cancer cell lines.

On western blot analysis, it was confirmed that HCA induces glucose-regulated protein, 78 kDa (GRP78) and some representative endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-responsive proteins. Furthermore, HCA treatment decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. The effect of HCA on cytochrome c and Bax translocation between cytosol and mitochondrial membrane was clarified using western blot analysis. These results suggest that HCA-induced apoptosis is associated with the inhibition of the proteasome activity that leads in turn to the increase of ER stress and mitochondrial perturbation.	cinnamomum cassia 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde
1	Toxicity of spray and fumigant products containing cassia oil to Dermatophagoides farinae and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Acari: Pyroglyphidae).The toxicity of formulations of oil of cassia, Cinnamomum cassia Blume, (20 and 50 g L(-1) sprays and 100% oil-based fumigant) to adult Dermatophagoides farinae Hughes and D. pteronyssinus Trouessart was examined using contact and vapour-phase toxicity bioassays. Results were compared with the lethal activity of three commercial acaricides: benzyl benzoate, dibutyl phthalate and diethyl-m-toluamide (deet). The contact toxicity of cassia oil to both dust mite species was comparable with that of benzyl benzoate but was higher than that of the other two acaricides. Sprays containing 20 and 50 g L(-1) cassia oil were effective against both mite species when applied to fabric, glass, paper, plastic, tin or wood substrates. Applications of the 50 g L(-1) spray to different space volumes and surface areas determined that 50-60 mg of cassia oil was needed to control dust mites in 3.4 m(3) or in 1 m(2). In tests with fumigant devices, toxicity varied according to the thickness of non-woven fabric covering the device, the exposure time, the number of fumigant devices used and the volume of the space sprayed. Fumigant toxicity to adult D. pteronyssinus was more pronounced with devices enclosed in thinner (40 microm) versus thicker (45 or 50 microm) non-woven fabric covers. A single fumigant device with a 40 microm thick non-woven fabric cover resulted in substantial control in a space of 0.05 m(3) but exhibited only moderate to weak control in spaces &gt;or= 0.097 m(3) at 4 days after application. Two fumigant devices gave 88% mortality in a space of 1.73 m(3). Cassia oil applied as sprays or in fumigant devices appears to provide effective protection of humans from house dust mites.	cinnamomum cassia (-1) cassia oil
1	Dietary Ziziphus jujuba Fruit Influence on Aberrant Crypt Formation and Blood Cells in Colitis-Associated Colorectal Cancer in Mice.Ziziphus jujuba (ZJ) fruit is rich in bioactive functional components such as polysaccharides, triterpenoid acid, flavonoids and oleamide. It has been commonly used in the treatment of various diseases including diabetes, digestive disorders, diarrhea, skin infections, liver and urinary complaints. However, dietary effects with regard to chemoprevention of colon cancer have not been studied. The present study was performed to evaluate the protective effects of dietary ZJ against colitis-associated colon carcinogenesis in azoxymethane (AOM)-dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)-treated mice. AOM was injected (10 mg/kg b.wt., i.p.) and three cycles of 2% DSS in drinking water for 7 days with 14 days of normal drinking water in-between were administered to induce colitis-associated colon cancer. ZJ fruit was supplemented into feed at levels of 5 and 10%. Dietary ZJ significantly attenuated aberrant crypt foci (ACF) formation and also decreased the progression of hyperplasia to dysplasia. In addition, it significantly reduced circulating white blood cells, lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils and platelets compared to colon cancer mice. We conclude that ZJ supplementation may delay the progression of colon cancer from hyperplasia to dysplasia and ultimately adenocarcinoma and cancer. In addition, it decreased circulating tumor-related leukocytes, main regulators of cancer inflammation. Dietary consumption of ZJ fruit attenuated the formation of ACF and delayed the progression of colon cancer. 	ziziphus jujuba triterpenoid acid

0	Protective effects of 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde an active ingredients of Cinnamomum cassia on warm hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury in rat model.Objectives: Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) is one of the major causes of hepatic failure during liver transplantation, trauma, and infections. The present study investigated the protective effect of intra-portal administration of 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde (2-MCA) on hepatic IRI in rats. Materials and Methods: Twenty-four rats were equally divided into four groups; 1) sham group, (no IRI or transfusion), 2) Hepatic IRI (60 min ischemia + 120 min reperfusion, 3) Hepatic IRI+ NS (IRI + normal saline), 4) Hepatic IRI+2-MCA, (IRI + 2-MCA). In groups 3 and 4, 1 ml/kg normal saline and 2-MCA were administered slowly into the vein of the left lateral and median lobes of the liver 10 min before induction of hepatic reperfusion (upper the site of clumping), respectively. The harvest time points were at 2 hours post-reperfusion in all groups. Results: Histologically, cell death, degenerative changes, sinusoidal dilatation, congestion, hemorrhage, and infiltration of inflammatory cells were observed in IRI group, while these pathological changes were attenuated in the 2-MCA administrated group. The level of alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, tumor necrosis factor- alpha and interleukin-6 in serum and hepatic malondialdehyde were significantly increased by IRI, and 2-MCA administration reduced all these markers. In addition, caspase-3 and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) expression were investigated immunohistochemically. Administration of 2-MCA considerably decreased caspase-3 positive cells and NF-kappaB activity in comparison with IRI group. Conclusion: As a conclusion, in situ administration of 2-MCA protects against hepatic IRI via anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties.	2-MCA caspase-3

1	Anti-inflammatory mechanism of lonchocarpine in LPS- or poly(I:C)-induced neuroinflammation.Neuroinflammation plays an important role in the progression of various neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of lonchocarpine, a natural compound isolated from Abrus precatorius, under in vitro and in vivo neuroinflammatory conditions induced by challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- or polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)). Lonchocarpine suppressed the expression of iNOS and proinflammatory cytokines in LPS or poly(I:C)-stimulated BV2 microglial cells. These anti-inflammatory effects were verified in brains of mice with systemic inflammation induced by administration of LPS or poly(I:C). Lonchocarpine reduced the number of Iba-1-positive activated microglia, and suppressed the mRNA expression of various proinflammatory markers in the cortex of LPS- or poly(I:C)-injected mice. Molecular mechanistic experiments showed that lonchocarpine inhibited NF-kappaB activity by reducing the phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaBalpha in LPS- or poly(I:C)-stimulated BV2 cells. Analysis of further upstream signaling pathways in LPS-stimulated microglia showed that lonchocarpine inhibited the phosphorylation of IkappaB kinase and TGFbeta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1). Moreover, lonchocarpine suppressed the interaction of myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and intereleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4). These data suggest that toll-like receptor 4 downstream signals such as MyD88/IRAK4-TAK1-NF-kappaB are at least partly involved in the anti-inflammatory mechanism of lonchocarpine in LPS-stimulated microglia. Its strong anti-inflammatory effects may make lonchocarpine an effective preventative drug for neuroinflammatory disorders that are associated with systemic inflammation.	abrus precatorius lonchocarpine
1	Antifungal constituents of northern prickly ash, Zanthoxylum americanum mill.Leaf, fruit, stem, bark and root of Zanthoxylum americanum were investigated for antifungal activity with 11 strains of fungi representing diverse opportunistic and systemic pathogens, including Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus fumigatus. All extracts demonstrated a broad spectrum of antifungal activity and inhibited at least eight fungal species in a disk diffusion assay (600 microg/disk). Antifungal activity was light-dependent, with fruit and leaf extracts most active in general. The presence of light-mediated compounds, such as psoralen, 8-methoxypsoralen and imperatorin in extracts of different organs was confirmed by RP-HPLC. A high furanocoumarin content was detected in fruit and leaf and low furanocoumarin levels were found in bark and wood. A high positive correlation was observed between total furanocoumarin content and fungal inhibition zones (r2=0.902, p&lt;0.001). The results provide a phytochemical basis for the very widespread use of Z. americanum in indigenous North American ethnomedical tradition for conditions that may be related to fungal infections.	z. americanum furanocoumarin
1	Production of Abrus pulchellus ribosome-inactivating protein from seeds callus culture.Ribosome inactivating proteins (RIPs) were isolated from callus culture that were established from seed explants of Abrus pulchellus. Cotyledon segments of immature seeds were inoculated in basal medium MS supplemented with different concentrations of auxin (2,4-D), citokinin (kinetin and BA) and sucrose in order to determine the best callus induction. A. pulchellus type 2 RIP (pulchellin) expression was monitored in callus cultures by RT-PCR and biological activity. The calli obtained after 35 days were freeze dried, macerated and submitted to extraction of total RNA and proteins (0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.6 buffer, containing 0.15 M NaCl, 3 h at room temperature). A specific DNA fragment codifying the A-chain pulchellin was amplified from callus RNA suggesting the presence of the protein. This was confirmed in the calli crude extract that showed haemagglutinating activity against rabbit blood cells and a high intraperitoneal toxicity to mice. The crude extract was also submitted to affinity chromatography on a Sepharose-4B column. The retained protein, peak released by 0.1 M galactose, appeared to be composed of two main bands in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, in denaturating conditions, with a similar pattern to that obtained with seeds.	c. limon limonene
1	[Absorption of flavonoids from Abelmoschus manihot extract by in situ intestinal perfusion].To explore the mechanism of the absorption of flavonoids from Abelmoschus manihot flowers, in situ intestinal recirculation was performed to study the effect of the absorption at different concentrations and different intestinal regions. To evaluate the conditions of the absorption of six flavonoids from Abelmoschus manihot flowers, the concentrations of Abelmoschus manihot in the perfusion solution were determined by HPLC at predesigned time. And we have investigated the inhibitory effect of six flavonoids from Abelmoschus manihot flowers on P-glycoprotein (P-gp) drug efflux pump. The results demonstrated that the absorption rates of flavonoids from Abelmoschus manihot flowers are not significantly different (P &gt; 0.05) at various drug concentrations, the absorption of flavonoids from Abelmoschus manihot flowers is a first-order process with the passive diffusion mechanism. The absorption rates of each of flavonoids are significantly different. The absorption rate of flavonoid glycoside was lower than that of aglycone; the flavonoids from Abelmoschus manihot flowers could be absorbed in all of the intestinal segments. The best parts of intestine to absorb hyperoside and myricetin are jejunum and duodenum, separately. Verapamil could enhance the absorption of isoquercitrin, hyperoside, myricetin and quercetin-3'-O-glucoside by inhibiting P-glycoprotein (P-gp) drug efflux pump.	abelmoschus manihot quercetin-3'-O-glucoside
1	Two pairs of enantiomeric propylated flavonoids and a new lignan from the aerial parts of Abrus precatorius.Two pairs of novel enantiomeric flavonoids (1a, 1b and 2a, 2b), along with one new lignan (3), were isolated from the aerial parts of Abrus precatorius. All of these enantiomeric flavonoids featured an unprecedented propylated flavonoid skeleton representing a new family of flavonoid, and the new lignan was found to have an attractive arachidate ester side chain. Their structures were extensively elucidated by means of detailed NMR and mass spectroscopic analysis. Moreover, biological evaluation of antibacterial activity for these compounds against Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli were conducted.	abrus precatorius flavonoid
2	Therapeutic potential of root and stem bark of wild medicinal plant Ziziphus mauritiana (Lamk.) against silica induced toxicity in Wistar albino rats.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ziziphus mauritiana (Lamk.) of the family Rhamnaceae is a traditional herbal medicinal plant commonly called as 'ber' (Indian jujube). It is traditionally used as food source and helps in treatment of various diseases like malaria, asthma, diarrhoea, typhoid, diabetes, skin diseases and acts as a pain killer. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to evaluate the ability of extracts of barks of root and stem of Ziziphus mauritiana (ZM) to cure silica induced toxicity in Wistar albino rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experiments carried out on the acute toxicity studies of silica and therapeutic potential of ZM extracts were based on OECD guidelines and from these results lethal dose (LD50) values were determined. Silica was administered by IP injection at 20 mg/kg b.w. for 10 days and roots and stem barks extracts of ZM were fed orally by gavage at 400 mg/kg b.w. for 21 days. Assessments of biochemical, haematological parameters as well as liver histological examination were performed in the study. RESULTS: After 21 days of oral feeding of extracts of root and stem of ZM, it was found to alter the liver histology. Significant decrease in enzymes such as ALT, AST, ALP, LDH and urea, creatinine and uric acid levels in serum were recorded. Treatment with extracts could help enzymatic activity of liver antioxidant enzymes to settle towards normal level and significant decrease in the lipid peroxidation along with increase in the value of GSH in liver, was also observed. In addition, extracts of ZM also helped to reduce the serum NO, IL-6 and TNF-alpha level. CONCLUSION: Results of this study has suggested that the extracts of root and stem bark of ZM can be used for therapeutic purpose to prevent silica induced toxicity. ZM extracts could be utilised as natural antioxidant and immunotherapeutic medicines to protect silica induced cell damage.	jujube asthma
1	Linalool Affects the Antimicrobial Efficacy of Essential Oils.The high concentrations of essential oils are generally required to receive microbial purity of the products (cosmetics, medicine). On the other hand, their application due to the high concentration of essential oils may be limited by changes in organoleptic and textural quality of the products, as well as they cause irritation and allergies in users. Addition of linalool to essential oil may significantly enhance its antimicrobial effectiveness and reduce their concentrations in products, taking advantage of their synergistic and additive effects. The aim of the study was to compare antimicrobial activity of essential oil alone and in combination with linalool. The antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Thymus vulgaris, Juniperus communis, Pelargonium graveolens, Citrus bergamia, Citrus grandis, Lavandula angustifolia, Cinnamomum zeylanicum, Melaleuca alternifolia, Syzygium aromaticum, linalool and their combination was investigated against bacteria and fungi using the disc diffusion method. The addition of linalool to S. aromaticum oil in a synergistic manner enhanced its antimicrobial efficacy against P. aeruginosa and A. brasiliensis. Moreover, the additive interaction between this oil and linalool was observed against S. aureus, E. coli and C. albicans. It was also found that linalool in an additive manner increased the antimicrobial effectiveness of T. vulgaris oil against P. aeruginosa. The antimicrobial properties of mixture of essential oils with their active constituents may be used for creating new strategies to maintain microbiological purity of products. 	s. aromaticum linalool
0	Total flavones of Abelmoschus manihot improve diabetic nephropathy by inhibiting the iRhom2/TACE signalling pathway activity in rats.CONTEXT: Total flavones extracted from Abelmoschus manihot L. (Malvaceae) medic (TFA) have been proven clinically effective at improving renal inflammation and glomerular injury in chronic kidney disease (CKD). OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the function of TFA as an inhibitor of iRhom2/TACE (tumour necrosis factor-alpha converting enzyme) signalling and investigated its anti-DN (diabetic nephropathy) effects in a DN rat model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vitro, cells were treated with 200 mug/mL advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and then co-cultured with 20 mug/mL TFA for 24 h. Real time PCR, western blotting and co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed. In vivo, DN was induced in 8 week old male Sprague-Dawley rats via unilateral nephrectomy and intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin, then TFA were administered to rats by gavage for 12 weeks at three different doses (300, 135 and 75 mg/kg/d). 4-Phenylbutanoic acid (2.5 mg/kg/d) was used as a positive control. RESULTS: IC50 of TFA is 35.6 muM in HK2 and 39.6 muM in HRMC. TFA treatment (20 muM) inhibited the activation of iRhom2/TACE signalling in cultured cells induced by AGEs. LD50&gt;26 g/kg and ED50=67 mg/kg of TFA in rat by gavage, TFA dose-dependently downregulated the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and exerted anti-inflammatory effects significantly though inhibiting the activation of iRhom2/TACE signalling. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that TFA could dose-dependently ameliorate renal inflammation by inhibiting the activation of iRhom2/TACE signalling and attenuating ER stress. These results suggest that TFA has potential therapeutic value for the treatment of DN in humans.	flavones TACE
1	Cinnamomum cassia extract promotes thermogenesis during exposure to cold via activation of brown adipose tissue.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Cinnamomum cassia (L.) J.Presl (Lauraceae), a widely used traditional Chinese medicine, is well known to exert hot property. It is recorded as dispelling cold drug in ancient Chinese monographs, such as Synopsis of golden chamber published in Han dynasty. According to Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2015), Cinnamomum cassia (L.) J.Presl (Cinnamon) has the functions of dispersing cold, relieving pain, warming meridians and promoting blood circulation. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of Cinnamon extract (CE) on cold endurance and the mechanism of thermogenesis activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The improving effect of hypothermia were evaluated with body temperature by infrared camera and multi-thermo thermometer. In vivo, the thermogenic effect was observed with energy metabolism and substrate utilization. The activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) was evaluated with the histomorphology and expression of thermogenic protein. In vitro, the uncoupling effects on mitochondrial was evaluated with Seahorse and fluorescent staining. The mechanism of thermogenesis was explored in brown adipocyte. RESULTS: The body temperature and energy expenditure were significantly increased by CE administration in cold environment. In morphology, lipid droplets were reduced and the number of mitochondrial was increased. CE significantly increased the non-shivering thermogenesis via upregulating the expression of thermogenic protein. In vitro, the uncoupling effect was obviously along with the decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production. It was confirmed that the thermogenesis effect was induced via lipolysis and energy metabolism. In addition, CE also alleviated myocardium injury in the morphology in cold environment. Moreover, the major constituent was identified as (1) coumarin, (2) cinnamic acid, (3) cinnamaldehyde and (4) 2-methoxy cinnamaldehyde. CONCLUSIONS: The mechanism of improving cold tolerance was related to lipolysis and activation of BAT. Meanwhile, we provided a kind of potential prevention methods for cold injury.	cinnamomum cassia coumarin
4	Development and characterization of immobilized cannabinoid receptor (CB1/CB2) open tubular column for on-line screening.Cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, are therapeutic targets in the treatment of anxiety, obesity, movement disorders, glaucoma, and pain. We have developed an on-line screening method for CB1 and CB2 ligands, where cellular membrane fragments of a chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line, KU-812, were immobilized onto the surface of an open tubular (OT) capillary to create a CB1/CB2-OT column. The binding activities of the immobilized CB1/CB2 receptors were established using frontal affinity chromatographic techniques. This is the first report that confirms the presence of functional CB1 and CB2 receptors on KU-812 cells. The data from this study confirm that the CB1/CB2-OT column can be used to determine the binding affinities (K(i) values) for a single compound and to screen individual compounds or a mixture of multiple compounds. The CB1/CB2-OT column was also used to screen a botanical matrix, Zanthoxylum clava-herculis, where preliminary results suggest the presence of a high-affinity phytocannabinoid.	CB1 obesity
2	In vitro anti-Helicobacter pylori action of 30 Chinese herbal medicines used to treat ulcer diseases.Infection by Helicobacter pylori has been ascertained to be an important etiologic impetus leading usually to chronic active gastritis and gastric ulcer with growing incidences worldwide. Utilizing as the test pathogen a standard and five clinic strains of Helicobacter pylori, the antibacterial action was assessed in vitro with ethanol extracts of 30 Chinese herbal medicines which have been frequently prescribed since ancient times for treating gastritis-like disorders. Among the 30 tested materials, the ethanol extracts of Abrus cantoniensis (Fabaceae), Saussurea lappa (Asteraceae) and Eugenia caryophyllata (Myrtaceae) were strongly inhibitory to all test strains (MICs: approximately 40 microg/ml), and Hippophae rhamnoides (Elaeagnaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii (Liliaceae), Magnolia officinalis and Schisandra chinensis (Magnoliaceae), Corydalis yanhusuo (Papaveraceae), Citrus reticulata (Rutaceae), Bupleurum chinense and Ligusticum chuanxiong (Apiaceae) substantially active with MICs close to 60.0 microg/ml. As to antibacterial actions of the aqueous extracts of the same drugs, those derived from Cassia obtusifolia (Fabaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii and Eugenia caryophyllata were remarkably inhibitory against all the six Helicobacter pylori strains (MICs: approximately 60 microg/ml). The work compared almost quantitatively the magnitude of the anti-Helicobacter pylori actions of the 30 most prescribed gastritis-treating Chinese herbal drugs, and located as well some source plants where potent anti-Helicobacter pylori phytochemicals could be characterized.	schisandra chinensis gastritis
1	Hepatoprotective activity of leaves of Zanthoxylum armatum DC in CCl4 induced hepatotoxicity in rats.Zanthoxylum armatum DC (Rutaceae) is extensively used in indigenous system of medicine as a tonic, carminative, stomachic and anthelmintic. In the present study, the hepatoprotective activity of the leaves ethanolic extract of Z. armatum (EEZA) was evaluated in CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity in rats. The extract at a dose of 500 mg/kg registered a significant decrease in the levels of serum glutamyl oxalacetic acid transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamyl pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase (ALKP), and serum bilurubin (SBLN) and liver inflammation, which was supported by histopathological studies on liver, thus exhibited a significant hepatoprotective activity. The phytochemical screening of defatted ethanolic extract showed the presence of sterols, alkaloids, flavonoids, and reducing sugars.	z. armatum sterols
1	Aroma constituents and alkylamides of red and green huajiao (Zanthoxylum bungeanum and Zanthoxylum schinifolium).Huajiao denotes the fruits of various species of Zanthoxylum in the plant family Rutaceare used for cooking. The two most commercially popular species are bungeanum (red huajiao) and schinifolium (green huajiao). Fresh huajiao has a very high content of essential oil, up to 11%, which is described as having fresh, spicy, floral, cooling, and green aroma notes. A comprehensive analysis of the essential oils by GC-MS using advanced peak deconvolution and data processing software, revealed many overlapping components. A total of 120 aroma compounds for each species has been found. In the essential oils, linalyl acetate (15%), linalool (13%), and limonene (12%) are the major components of red huajiao, whereas linalool (29%), limonene (14%), and sabinene (13%) are the major components of green huajiao. For estimation of the aroma contribution of individual components, a new concept, "aroma character impact value" (ACI), is introduced as the percentage of the ratio of the concentration of an aroma component to its odor threshold value. Despite the differences in major components, both species have six common compounds of top aroma character impact: linalool, alpha-terpineol, myrcene, 1,8-cineole, limonene, and geraniol. The tingling sensation of huajiao is caused mainly by the alkylamide hydroxy-alpha-sanshool. The tingling compound decomposes easily under hydrolytic conditions or under UV light.	Zanthoxylum myrcene
1	Antibacterial benzofuran neolignans and benzophenanthridine alkaloids from the roots of Zanthoxylum capense.Two new 2-arylbenzofuran neolignans and a new benzophenanthridine alkaloid, together with six known benzophenanthridine alkaloids, namely, decarine, norchelerythrine, dihydrochelerythrine, 6-acetonyldihydrochelerythrine, tridecanonchelerythrine, and 6-acetonyldihydronitidine, have been isolated from the MeOH extract of the roots of Zanthoxylum capense. Their structures were elucidated by means of spectroscopic techniques including 2D NMR experiments. All the isolated compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Some compounds showed significant inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 with MIC values ranging from 12.5 to 50 mug/mL.	zanthoxylum capense norchelerythrine
2	Cinnamon and Chronic Diseases.Cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum and Cinnamon cassia), the eternal tree of tropical medicine, belongs to the Lauraceae family and is one of the most important spices used daily by people all over the world. It contains a lot of manganese, iron, dietary fiber, and calcium. Cinnamon contains derivatives, such as cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid, cinnamate, and numerous other components such as polyphenols and antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, anticancer effects. Several reports have dealt with the numerous properties of cinnamon in the forms of bark, essential oils, bark powder, and phenolic compounds, and each of these properties can play a key role in human health. Recently, many trials have explored the beneficial effects of cinnamon in Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, arthritis, and arteriosclerosis, but still we need further investigations to provide additional clinical evidence for this spice against cancer and inflammatory, cardioprotective, and neurological disorders.	cinnamon diabetes
1	High-performance liquid chromatography--two wavelength detection of triterpenoid acids from the fruits of Ziziphus jujuba containing various cultivars in different regions and classification using chemometric analysis.A simple and sensitive HPLC-DAD method has been developed for the first time to simultaneously determine 10 triterpenoid acids (ceanothic acid, alphitolic acid, zizyberanal acid, zizyberanalic acid, epiceanothic acid, ceanothenic acid, betulinic acid, oleanolic acid, ursonic acid and zizyberenalic acid) in the dried fruit of Ziziphus jujuba (called Dazao) which has been widely used as one of the traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs). This HPLC assay was performed on a reversed-phase C(18) column (250 mm x 4.6mm, 5 microm) with the column temperature at 35 degrees C. The mobile phase was composed of A (acetonitrile) and B (0.05% aqueous phosphoric acid, v/v). The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min and the detection wave length was set at 205 nm for reference compounds 1-9 and 238 nm for reference compound 10. All calibration curves showed good linear regression (r(2)&gt;0.9999) within the test range. The established method showed good precision and accuracy with overall intra-day and inter-day variations of 0.43-1.72% and 0.53-2.45%, respectively, and overall recoveries of 94.98-104.09% for the 10 compounds analyzed. The validated method was successfully applied for the simultaneous determination of the 10 triterpenoid acids in 42 batches of Dazao which contained 36 cultivars from 22 cultivation regions, and were investigated and authenticated as Z. jujuba. Hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) and principal components analysis (PCA) were performed to differentiate and classify the samples based on the contents of the 10 triterpenoid acids. The presented HPLC-DAD method conjugated with chemometrics approach was demonstrated to be very helpful in using Dazao resources, and was possibly useful in chemotaxonomic characterization.	z. jujuba ursonic acid
2	Cinnamomum cassia: an implication of serotonin reuptake inhibition in animal models of depression.The aim of the study was to explore the traditional use of Cinnamomum cassia against depression. The standardised methanolic extract of the bark of C. cassia was evaluated for antidepressant activity using various behavioural tests, i.e. tail suspension test (TST), forced swim test (FST) and locomotor activity test. The serotonergic and noradrenergic modulation was assessed using 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP)-induced head twitches and yohimbine potentiation tests, respectively. The fluoxetine and phenelzine were used as positive controls in the study. The C. cassia extract significantly decreased the immobility time in TST (maximum effective dose tested was 50 mg/kg) while no effect was observed in FST and locomotor activity test. The extract significantly increased the 5-HTP-induced head twitches while yohimbine-induced lethality remained unaltered. The aforementioned results are similar to that caused by fluoxetine. The standardised methanolic extract of C. cassia demonstrated antidepressant activity that can be attributed to rise in serotonin levels.	c. cassia depression
3	6-Acetonyldihydrochelerythrine Is a Potent Inducer of Apoptosis in HCT116 and SW620 Colon Cancer Cells.6-Acetonyldihydrochelerythrine (1), a benzophenanthridine alkaloid, isolated from the methanol extract of Zanthoxylum capense, displayed potent cytotoxic activity in human HCT116 and SW620 colon carcinoma cells, to a higher extent than 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), the cornerstone chemotherapeutic agent in colon cancer. Cytotoxicity of 1 was evaluated by MTS, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and Guava ViaCount assays. Interestingly, 1 significantly induced cytotoxicity in both cell lines, leading to a significant increase in LDH release, as compared to 5-FU. Further, Guava ViaCount flow cytometry assays demonstrated that 1 significantly increased cell death, as shown by the presence of a significantly higher population of apoptotic cells in both cell lines, as compared to cells exposed to 5-FU. Furthermore, evaluation of nuclear morphology by Hoechst staining of 1-treated HCT116 and SW620 cells confirmed flow cytometry results, demonstrating a marked induction of apoptotic cell death by 1, again to a further extent than that elicited by 5-FU. In addition, immunoblot analysis to ascertain the molecular events triggered by 1 exposure was performed. The results show that 1 exposure reduced the steady-state expression and activation of the pro-survival proteins ERK5 and Akt and increased the steady-state expression of p53 in both HCT116 and SW620 cells. Changes in ERK5 or Akt activation can be ascertained by evaluating the ratio of p-ERK5/ERK5 or p-Akt/Akt. In addition, exposure to 1 reduced expression of XIAP, Bcl-XL, and Bcl-2, while increasing the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in both cell lines. Collectively, the data indicate that 6-acetonyldihydrochelerythrine (1) is a potent inducer of apoptosis in HCT116 and SW620 cell lines, highlighting its potential relevance in colon cancer. 	6-acetonyldihydrochelerythrine colon cancer
4	Zanthoxyli Fructus induces growth arrest and apoptosis of LNCaP human prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo in association with blockade of the AKT and AR signal pathways.Zanthoxyli Fructus belongs to the family of oranges and is used as a seasoning in Asian countries including Japan. This study found that a water extract of Zanthoxyli Fructus possessed anti-tumor activity against a wide variety of cancer cells including those from prostate (LNCaP, DU145, PC-3), breast (MCF-7, T47D, MDA-MB231), lung (NCI-H460, -H520), as well as leukemia (HL-60, NB4, Jurkat) in vitro, as measured by the trypan blue exclusion test. Importantly, Zanthoxyli Fructus slowed the proliferation of LNCaP, DU145, and MDA-MB231 cells present as xenografts in BALB/c nude mice without adverse effects. Further studies explored the molecular mechanism by which Zanthoxyli Fructus inhibited the proliferation of androgen-dependent human prostate cancer LNCaP cells because Zanthoxyli Fructus possessed the strongest anti-tumor activity against these cells. Zanthoxyli Fructus blocked androgen receptor (AR) signaling in conjunction with down-regulation of nuclear levels of AR and induced apoptosis of these cells, as measured by the reporter assay, Western blot analysis, and TUNEL assay, respectively. As expected, Zanthoxyli Fructus also decreased the level of the AR-target molecule, prostate-specific antigen in these cells. Furthermore, Zanthoxyli Fructus inhibited AKT kinase and down-regulated levels of cyclin D1 protein, as measured by the AKT kinase assay with GSK-3alpha/beta as a substrate and Western blot analysis, respectively. Taken together, Zanthoxyli Fructus might be useful as an adjunctive therapeutic agent for the treatment of individuals with a variety of cancer types.	AR prostate cancer
2	Recognition intensities of submolecular structures, mammalian glyco-structural units, ligand cluster and polyvalency in abrin-a-carbohydrate interactions.Abrin-a is the most toxic fraction of lectins isolated from Abrus precatorius seeds and belongs to the family of type 2 ribosome inactivating proteins (RIP). This toxin may act as a defense molecule in plants against viruses, fungi and insects, where attachment of abrin-a to the exposed glycans on the surface of target cells is the crucial and initial step of its cytotoxicity. Although it has been studied for over four decades, the recognition factors involved in abrin-a-carbohydrate interaction remains to be clarified. In this study, roles of mammalian glyco-structural units, ligand clusters and polyvalency in abrin-a recognition were comprehensively analyzed by enzyme-linked lectinosorbent binding and inhibition assays. The results indicate that: (i) this toxin prefers oligosaccharides having alpha-anomer of galactose (Gal) at the non-reducing terminal than the corresponding beta-anomer; (ii) Galalpha1-3Galalpha1- (B(alpha)), Galalpha1-4Gal (E), Galbeta1-3GalNAc (T) and Galbeta1-3/4GlcNAc (I/II) related oligosaccharides were the active glyco-structural units; (iii) tri-antennary II(beta), prepared from N-glycan of asialo fetuin, played a dominant role in recognition; (iv) many high-density polyvalent I(beta)/II(beta) and E(beta) glycotopes enhanced the reactivity; (v) the carbohydrate recognition domain of abrin-a is proposed to be a combination of a small cavity type of Gal as major site and a groove type of additional one to tetrasaccharides as subsites with a preference of alpha1-3/4/6Gal, beta1-3GalNAc, beta1-3/4/6GlcNAc, beta1-4/6Glc, beta1-3DAra and beta1-4Man as subterminal sugars; (vi) size of the carbohydrate recognition domain may be as large enough to accommodate a linear pentasaccharide and complementary to Galalpha1-3Galbeta1-4GlcNAc beta1-3Galbeta1-4Glc (gailipenta) sequence. A comparison of the recognition factors and combining sites of abrin-a with ricin, another highly toxic lectin, was also performed to further understand the differences in recognition factors between these two type 2 RIPs.	abrus precatorius cytotoxicity
2	Inhibitory effects of Cinnamomum cassia extract on atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions induced by mite antigen in NC/Nga mice.AIM OF THE STUDY: Cinnamomum cassia (C. cassia) has been traditionally used to treat allergic disease as well as dyspepsia, gastritis, and blood circulation disturbances. However, the antiallergic properties of C. cassia have not been fully verified using scientific tools. This study investigated the effectiveness of C. cassia extract (CCE) as an antiallergic agent in atopic dermatitis model and underlying mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effect of CCE on mite antigen-treated NC/Nga mice was evaluated by examining skin symptom severity, levels of serum IgE, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and histamine, skin histology, and mRNA expression of cytokines in the skin lesions. Moreover, the effect of CCE on TNF-alpha-and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-induced chemokine production in human keratinocytes was investigated using ELISA. RESULTS: CCE treatment of NC/Nga mice reduced the dermatitis score and the levels of serum IgE, histamine, and TNF-alpha. Histological examination showed inhibition of the thickening of the epidermis/dermis and reduced dermal infiltration of inflammatory cells. In skin lesions, mRNA expression of IL-4, TNF-alpha, and thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) was inhibited by CCE treatment. The production of TARC, macrophage-derived chemokine, and RANTES from IFN-gamma-and TNF-alpha-stimulated human keratinocytes was suppressed by CCE treatment in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: CCE inhibits the development of atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions in NC/Nga mice by suppressing the T-helper 2 cell response.	c. cassia atopic dermatitis
2	Anthelmintic screening of Zimbabwean plants traditionally used against schistosomiasis.Extracts of 23 plant species used popularly against schistosomiasis in Zimbabwe were screened for their anthelmintic effect. Schistosomules of the trematode Schistosoma mansoni and cysticercoids of the cestode Hymenolepis diminuta were studied in vitro. The material consisted of 58 plant extracts, of which 37 killed the newly excysted cysticercoids within an hour, when incubated in a culture medium. Lethal concentrations varied from 0.8 to 103 mg/ml. All plant extracts showed activity against the tapeworms after 24 h. Ten of the best extracts were also tested against schistosomules. Five of these extracts showed activity. Lethal concentrations varied from 0.6 to 33.8 mg/ml of dry plant material. Extracts of stem and root from Abrus precatorius (Fabaceae), of root bark and leaves from Ozoroa insignis (Anacardiaceae) and of root bark from Zizyphus mucronata (Rhamnaceae) gave the best results against tapeworms. The best results against schistosomules were obtained with stem and root extracts from Abrus precatorius (Fabaceae) and stem bark from Elephantorrhiza goetzei (Mimosaceae). Although the activity of root and root bark extracts commonly used in traditional medicine was verified in this study, our results showed that also extracts from leaf and stem can be effective anthelmintics.	ozoroa insignis trematode schistosoma mansoni
1	Inhibitory effect of phenylbutanoid-rich Zingiber cassumunar extracts on nitric oxide production by murine macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells.Four phenylbutanoids, (E)-4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-en-l-ol (I), (E)-4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-en-l-yl acetate (II), (E)-1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)butadiene (III) and (E)-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-[(E)-3,4-dimethoxystyryl]cyclohex-1-ene (IV), isolated from Zingiber cassumunar, were used as standard markers for quantitative determination and preparation of phenylbutanoid-enriched Z. cassumunar extracts (PZEs). A reversed-phase HPLC method was established for the simultaneous determination of the phenylbutanoids in Z. cassumunar extracts. Systematic extraction studies to maximize phenylbutanoid content revealed that hexane was the most appropriate solvent for extraction. A one-step purification of the hexane crude extract of Z. cassumunar, using silica gel vacuum chromatography, provided the PZEs. The content of phenylbutanoids in the PZEs was up to 48.3% w/w dry weight. The anti-inflammatory activity of PZEs via inhibition of nitric oxide production by murine macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells was stronger than those of the four individual phenylbutanoids, the crude hexane extract and the essential oil of Z. cassumunar.	z. cassumunar phenylbutanoid
1	Metabolism of hibifolin by human intestinal bacteria.Hibifolin, the highest-content bioactive flavonoid of the flowers of Abelmoschus manihot, was incubated with human intestinal bacteria, and four metabolites (1-4) were obtained from the incubated solution by chromatographic methods. The structures of the four metabolites were elucidated as gossypetin 8-O-beta-D-4''-deoxy- Delta(4'')-glucuropyranoside (1), gossypetin (2), quercetin (3), and 8-methoxy-quercetin (4), respectively, on the basis of UV, NMR, and MS data. Metabolite 1 was obtained as a new compound with a specific beta-D-4''-deoxy-Delta(4'')-glucuropyranosyl moiety, which was formed through a unique and novel metabolic pathway that has not been reported previously.	abelmoschus manihot quercetin
1	Antibacterial benzofuran neolignans and benzophenanthridine alkaloids from the roots of Zanthoxylum capense.Two new 2-arylbenzofuran neolignans and a new benzophenanthridine alkaloid, together with six known benzophenanthridine alkaloids, namely, decarine, norchelerythrine, dihydrochelerythrine, 6-acetonyldihydrochelerythrine, tridecanonchelerythrine, and 6-acetonyldihydronitidine, have been isolated from the MeOH extract of the roots of Zanthoxylum capense. Their structures were elucidated by means of spectroscopic techniques including 2D NMR experiments. All the isolated compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Some compounds showed significant inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 with MIC values ranging from 12.5 to 50 mug/mL.	zanthoxylum capense benzophenanthridine alkaloid
2	Chemical constituents, clinical efficacy and molecular mechanisms of the ethanol extract of Abelmoschus manihot flowers in treatment of kidney diseases.Abelmoschus manihot, also called as "Huangkui" in Chinese, is an annual flowering herb plant in the family of Malvaceae. As a traditional Chinese medicine, the ethanol extract of the flower in Abelmoschus manihot is made as Huangkui capsule and has been used for medication of the patients with kidney diseases. Its efficacy in clinical symptoms is mainly improving renal function and reducing proteinuria among the patients with chronic kidney disease, diabetic kidney disease or IgA nephropathy. The possible mechanism of Huangkui capsule treatment in kidney diseases may include reducing inflammation and anti-oxidative stress, improving immune response, protecting renal tubular epithelial cells, ameliorating podocyte apoptosis, glomerulosclerosis and mesangial proliferation, as well as inhibiting renal fibrosis. In this review, we first described chemical constituents and pharmacokinetic characteristics in ethanol extract of the flower of Abelmoschus manihot. We then summarized the clinical and epidemiological relevancies of kidney diseases particularly in the mainland of China and discussed the possible molecular mechanisms of Huangkui capsule in the treatment of kidney diseases. Finally, we prospected further research on cellular and molecular mechanisms and application of this Chinese natural medicine in kidney diseases.	abelmoschus manihot kidney diseases
1	Encapsulation of plai oil/2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin inclusion complexes in polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) electrospun nanofibers for topical application.The aim of this study was to prepare electrospun polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)/2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPbetaCD) nanofiber mats and to incorporate plai oil (Zingiber Cassumunar Roxb.). The plai oil with 10, 20 and 30% wt to polymer were incorporated in the PVP/HPbetaCD solution and electrospun to obtain nanofibers. The morphology and structure of the PVP and PVP/HPbetaCD nanofiber mats with and without the plai oil were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The thermal behaviors of the nanofiber mats were characterized using differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). Terpinen-4-ol was used as a marker of the plai oil. The amount of plai oil remaining in the PVP/HPbetaCD nanofiber mats was determined using gas chromatography-mass spectoscopy (GC-MS). The SEM images revealed that all of the fibers were smooth. The average diameter of fibers was 212-450 nm, and decreased with the increasing of plai oil content. The release characteristics of plai oil from the fiber showed the fast release followed by a sustained release over the experimental time of 24 h. The release rate ranged was in the order of 10% &gt; 20% ~ 30% plai oil within 24 h. Electrospun fibers with 20% plai oil loading provided the controlled release and also showed the highest plai oil content. Hence, this electrospun nanofiber has a potential for use as an alternative topical application.	zingiber cassumunar roxb Terpinen-4-ol
2	Hypoglycemic activity of Ziziphus mauritiana aqueous ethanol seed extract in alloxan-induced diabetic mice.Ziziphus mauritiana Lamk. (Rhamnaceae) is a fruit tree that has been used as folkloric medicine for many ailments and diseases. In the present study, the hypoglycemic effect of seed extract of Ziziphus mauritiana in alloxan-induced diabetic mice was assessed. Seed extract was administered orally at doses of 100, 400, and 800 mg/kg body weight (bw) and also in combination with glyburide (800 mg/kg seed extract and 10 mg/kg glyburide) to different groups of mice (normal and alloxan-treated diabetic mice). Their blood glucose level (in acute and sub-acute study), body weight, and mortality rate were monitored. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was also performed. Oral administration of extract alone or in combination with glyburide reduced the blood glucose level in all the diabetic mice after acute and sub-acute (28 days) administration. Administration of the extract reduced the weight loss and mortality rate during the sub-acute study. The results of blood glucose level, loss in body weight, and mortality rate were more pronounced in the group treated with combination (800 mg/kg seed extract and 10 mg/kg glyburide). The extract also augmented the glucose tolerance in both normal and diabetic mice. These results suggest that the extract possesses synergistic hypoglycemic activity.	ziziphus mauritiana diabetic
1	Invasion inhibitors of human fibrosarcoma HT 1080 cells from the rhizomes of Zingiber cassumunar: structures of phenylbutanoids, cassumunols.The methanolic extract and its EtOAc-soluble fraction from the rhizomes of Zingiber cassumunar inhibited invasion of human fibrosarcoma HT 1080 cells. From the EtOAc-soluble fraction, eight new phenylbutanoids, cassumunols A-H, were isolated together with 30 known constituents. The structures of new phenylbutanoids were elucidated on the basis of chemical and physicochemical evidence. Principal constituents were examined the inhibitory effects on the invasion of HT 1080 cells. Among them, phlain I and III, (E)-1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)buta-1,3-diene, (E)-1-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)buta-1,3-diene, and (-)-beta-sesquiphellandrene showed anti-invasion effects. Interestingly, (E)-1-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)buta-1,3-diene [inhibition (%) 46.8 +- 7.2 (p&lt;0.05) at 30 microM] significantly inhibited the invasion, and only a weak cytotoxic effect was observed.	zingiber cassumunar phenylbutanoids

2	[Clinical observation of toothpaste containing zanthoxylum nitidum extract on dental plaque and gingivitis].OBJECTIVE: To observe the clinical efficacy of drug toothpaste containing 2% Zanthoxylum Nitidum extract in reducing accumulation of dental plaque and occurrence of gingivitis in adults. METHODS: Adopting double-blind, stratified and parallel design, the status of dental plaque and gingivitis in 200 healthy adults enrolled in the trial (100 in the treated group took the drug toothpaste to clean teeth, and 100 in the control group use common toothpaste instead) were assessed at before experiment, 3 months and 6 months after experiment. RESULTS: At the end of the 3rd month and the 6th month, as compared with the control group, the L e-Silness Gingival Index (GI) in the treated group was decreased by 9.1% (P &gt; 0.05) and 13.9 % (P&lt; 0.5), in the same period, the Quigley-Hein(Turesky Modification) Plaque Index (PlI) decreased by 18.7% and 22.6% (P&lt;0.05), respectively. CONCLUSION: Toothpaste containing Zanthoxylum Nitidum extract can obviously decrease the incidence of dental plaque and enhance gingival health.	zanthoxylum nitidum gingivitis
2	Radiosensitizing effect of schinifoline from Zanthoxylum schinifolium Sieb et Zucc on human non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells: a preliminary in vitro investigation.Schinifoline (SF), a 4-quinolinone derivative, was found in Zanthoxylum schinifolium for the first time. 4-Quinolinone moieties are thought to have cytotoxic activity and are often used as a tubulin polymerization inhibitors, heterogeneous enzyme inhibitors and antiplatelet agents. However, very little information respect to radiosensitization has focused on SF. This work aimed to investigate the radiosensitizing effect of SF on A549 cells. The cell viability results indicated cytotoxicity of SF on A549 cells, with IC50 values of 33.7 +- 2.4, 21.9 +- 1.9 and 16.8 +- 2.2 mug/mL, respectively, after 6, 12, 24 h treatment with different concentrations, and the 10% or 20% IC50 concentration during 12 h was applied in later experiments. The results of cell proliferative inhibition and clonogenic assay showed that SF enhanced the radiosensitivity of A549 cells when applied before 60Co gamma-irradiation and this effect was mainly time and concentration dependent. The flow cytometric data indicated that SF treatment before the irradiation increased the G2/M phase, thus improving the radiosensitivity of A549, leading to cell apoptosis. This paper is the first study that describes the in vitro radiosensitising, cell cycle and apoptotic-inducing effects of schinifoline. 	zanthoxylum schinifolium schinifoline
1	2-methoxycinnamaldehyde from Cinnamomum cassia reduces rat myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury in vivo due to HO-1 induction.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Cinnamomum cassia Blume has been used as a traditional Chinese herbal medicine for alleviation of fever, inflammation, chronic bronchitis, and to improve blood circulation. AIM OF THE STUDY: We addressed whether 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde (2-MCA), one of active ingredients of Cinnamomum cassia, reduces vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expression in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-activated endothelial cells and protects ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-injury due to heme oxygenase (HO)-1 induction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult male rats were subjected to 30 min of ischemia by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery followed by 24h of reperfusion. Rats were randomized to receive vehicle or 2-MCA (i.v.) 10 min before reperfusion. RESULTS: Administration of 2-MCA significantly improved I/R-induced myocardial dysfunction by increasing the values of the first derivative (+-dp/dt) of left ventricular pressure and decreased infarct size. In addition, 2-MCA reduced the expression of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), an activator of the inflammatory cascade when released into the extracellular space, and VCAM-1 in I/R myocardium along with increase of HO-1 induction. The reduced injury was accompanied by significantly reduction of neutrophils infiltration and increased SOD activity in ischemic tissues and reduced serum level of cardiac troponin I (cTnI). Furthermore, 2-MCA significantly increased HO-1 induction by translocation of Nrf-2 from cytosol to nucleus in endothelial cells. Inhibition of VCAM-1 expression by 2-MCA was reversed both by SnPPIX, a HO-1 inhibitor and siHO-1 RNA trasfection in TNF-alpha-activated cells. In addition, 2-MCA significantly inhibited NF-kappaB luciferase activity in TNF-alpha-activated endothelial cells. As expected, 2-MCA significantly inhibited monocyte (U937) adhesion to endothelial cells. CONCLUSION: We concluded that 2-MCA protects of myocardial I/R-injury due to antioxidant and anti-inflammatory action possibly by HO-1 induction which can be explained why Cinnamomum cassia has been used in inflammatory disorders.	cinnamomum cassia 2-MCA
4	Development and characterization of immobilized cannabinoid receptor (CB1/CB2) open tubular column for on-line screening.Cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, are therapeutic targets in the treatment of anxiety, obesity, movement disorders, glaucoma, and pain. We have developed an on-line screening method for CB1 and CB2 ligands, where cellular membrane fragments of a chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line, KU-812, were immobilized onto the surface of an open tubular (OT) capillary to create a CB1/CB2-OT column. The binding activities of the immobilized CB1/CB2 receptors were established using frontal affinity chromatographic techniques. This is the first report that confirms the presence of functional CB1 and CB2 receptors on KU-812 cells. The data from this study confirm that the CB1/CB2-OT column can be used to determine the binding affinities (K(i) values) for a single compound and to screen individual compounds or a mixture of multiple compounds. The CB1/CB2-OT column was also used to screen a botanical matrix, Zanthoxylum clava-herculis, where preliminary results suggest the presence of a high-affinity phytocannabinoid.	CB2 anxiety
2	Effects of selected plant essential oils on the growth and development of mouse preimplantation embryos in vivo.Plant essential oils (EOs) have been reported to have health benefit properties and their preventive and therapeutic use in animals is expected to increase in the future. We evaluated the influence of five essential oils obtained from plant species which are known to have positive antimicrobial, antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects--sage EO from Salvia officinalis L. (Lamiaceae), oregano EO from Origanum vulgare L. (Lamiaceae), thyme EO from Thymus vulgaris L. (Lamiaceae), clove EO from Syzygium aromaticum L. (Myrtaceae) and cinnamon EO from Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume (Lauraceae) on the growth and development of mouse preimplantation embryos in vivo. Essential oils were added to commercial diet at concentrations of 0.25% for sage EO, thyme EO, clove EO, cinnamon EO and 0.1% for oregano EO, and fed to ICR female mice for 2 weeks ad libitum. Females were then mated with males of the same strain. Embryos obtained on Day 4 of pregnancy at the blastocyst stage were stained by morphological triple staining (Hoechst, PI, Calcein-AM) and evaluated using fluorescent microscopy. The effects of essential oils were estimated by the viability of embryos, number of nuclei and distribution of embryos according to nucleus number. Cinnamon EO significantly decreased the number of nuclei and the distribution of embryos according to nucleus number was significantly altered. Sage EO negatively influenced the distribution of embryos according to nucleus number. Clove and oregano EOs induced a significantly increased rate of cell death. Only thyme EO had no detectable effects on embryo development. In conclusion, none of the essential oils had any positive effect on embryo development, but some of them reduced the number of cells and increased the incidence of cell death.	oregano death
3	[Apoptosis of hepatocellular induced by active ingredients of Zanthoxyli Radix by Raman spectroscopy].The apoptosis of mono-hepatocellular induced by the active ingredients of the Zanthoxyli Radix was investigated using laser Raman spectroscopy. Hepatoma cells (BEL-7404) were treated with 10 mg L-1 nitidine chloride and 3 g L-1 the extracts of Zanthoxyli Radix, respectively, then were divided into two parts, one for fluorescence staining, the other for determination of Raman spectroscopy. The acquired spectra were then processed by background elimination, smoothing, and normalization. Fluorescence staining results showed that the nucleuses from untreated group were uniformly stained, while those from the group treated for 48 hours were densely stained and broken. The spectra results revealed that the intensity of peaks associated with nucleic acid and protein decreased after the cells were incubated with the extracts of Zanthoxyli Radix for 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours. The intensity of peaks at 785,1 002,1 175,1 660 cm-1 was decreased with the time of the cells were incubated by the extracts of Zanthoxyli Radix. The results indicated that the extracts of Zanthoxyli Radix could induce the apoptosis of hepatoma cells and reduce the amount of nucleic acid and protein in the cells. There is a certain relevance between the drug treatment time and the efficacy. The above results suggest that Raman spectra can provide abundant information about the changes in biological macromolecules within the cells after incubated by the extracts of Zanthoxyli Radix and serve as an effective method for the real time measurement of apoptosis.	nitidine chloride hepatoma
3	Cinnamomum cassia essential oil and its major constituent cinnamaldehyde induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human oral squamous cell carcinoma HSC-3 cells.Cinnamomum cassia essential oil (CC-EO) has various functional properties, such as anti-microbial, hypouricemic, anti-tyrosinase and anti-melanogenesis activities. The present study aimed to evaluate the anti-cancer activities of CC-EO and its major constituent, cinnamaldehyde, in human oral squamous cell carcinoma HSC-3 cells. Determination of the cell viability, apoptotic characteristics, DNA damage, cell cycle analysis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial membrane potential, cytosolic Ca2+ level and intracellular redox status were performed. Our results demonstrated that CC-EO and cinnamaldehyde significantly decreased cell viability and caused morphological changes. The cell cycle analysis revealed that CC-EO and cinnamaldehyde induced G2/M cell cycle arrest in HSC-3 cells. The apoptotic characteristics (DNA laddering and chromatin condensation) and DNA damage were observed in the CC-EO-treated and cinnamaldehyde-treated HSC-3 cells. Moreover, CC-EO and cinnamaldehyde promoted an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ levels, induced mitochondrial dysfunction and activated cytochrome c release. The results of ROS production and intracellular redox status demonstrated that CC-EO and cinnamaldehyde significantly increased the ROS production and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance levels, and the cellular glutathione content and glutathione peroxidase activity were significantly reduced in HSC-3 cells. Our results suggest that CC-EO and cinnamaldehyde may possess anti-oral cancer activity in HSC-3 cells.   2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Environ Toxicol 32: 456-468, 2017.	cinnamaldehyde cancer
1	Structure-activity relationship of benzophenanthridine alkaloids from Zanthoxylum rhoifolium having antimicrobial activity.Zanthoxylum rhoifolium (Rutaceae) is a plant alkaloid that grows in South America and has been used in Brazilian traditional medicine for the treatment of different health problems. The present study was designed to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the steam bark crude methanol extract, fractions, and pure alkaloids of Z. rhoifolium. Its stem bark extracts exhibited a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, ranging from 12.5 to 100 microg/mL using bioautography method, and from 125 to 500 microg/mL in the microdilution bioassay. From the dichloromethane basic fraction, three furoquinoline alkaloids (1-3), and nine benzophenanthridine alkaloids (4-12) were isolated and the antimicrobial activity of the benzophenanthridine alkaloids is discussed in terms of structure-activity relationships. The alkaloid with the widest spectrum of activity was chelerythrine (10), followed by avicine (12) and dihydrochelerythrine (4). The minimal inhibitory concentrations of chelerythrine, of 1.50 microg/mL for all bacteria tested, and between 3.12 and 6.25 microg/mL for the yeast tested, show this compound to be a more powerful antimicrobial agent when compared with the other active alkaloids isolated from Z. rhoifolium. To verify the potential importance of the methylenedioxy group (ring A) of these alkaloids, chelerythrine was selected to represent the remainder of the benzophenanthridine alkaloids isolated in this work and was subjected to a demethylation reaction giving derivative 14. Compared to chelerythrine, the derivative (14) was less active against the tested bacteria and fungi. Kinetic measurements of the bacteriolytic activities of chelerythrine against the bacteria Bacillus subtilis (Gram-positive) and Escherichia coli (Gram-negative) were determined by optical density based on real time assay, suggesting that its mechanism of action is not bacteriolytic. The present study did not detect hemolytic effects of chelerythrine on erythrocytes and found a protective effect considering the decrease in TBARS and AOPP (advanced oxidized protein products) levels when compared to the control group. 	z. rhoifolium dihydrochelerythrine
1	Angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory proteins and peptides from the rhizomes of Zingiberaceae plants.Ammonium sulphate cut protein extracts, and their pepsin hydrolysates, from the rhizomes of 15 plants in the Zingiberaceae family were screened for their in vitro angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory (ACEI) activity. The protein extract from Zingiber ottensii had the highest ACEI activity (IC(50) of 7.30 x 10(-7) mg protein/mL) and was enriched for by SP Sepharose chromatography with five NaCl step gradients 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1 M NaCl collecting the corresponding five fractions. The highest ACEI activity was found in the F75 fraction, which appeared to contain a single 20.7-kDa protein, suggesting enrichment to or near to homogeneity. The ACEI activity of the F75 fraction was moderately thermostable (-20-60  C), showed &gt;80% activity across a broad pH range of 4-12 (optimal at pH 4-5) and appeared as a competitive inhibitor of ACE (K(i) of 9.1 x 10(-5) mg protein/mL). For the pepsin hydrolysates, that from Zingiber cassumunar revealed the highest ACEI activity (IC(50) of 0.38 +- 0.012 mg/mL), was enriched to a single active hexapeptide by RP-HPLC with a strong ACEI activity (IC(50) of 0.011 +- 0.012 mg/mL) and acted as a competitive inhibitor of ACE (K(i) of 1.25 x 10(-6) mg protein/mL).	zingiber ottensii Sepharose
4	Inhibition of Akt/mTOR/p70S6K Signaling Activity With Huangkui Capsule Alleviates the Early Glomerular Pathological Changes in Diabetic Nephropathy.Huangkui capsule (HKC), a Chinese modern patent medicine extracted from Abelmoschus manihot (L.) medic, has been widely applied to clinical therapy in the early diabetic nephropathy (DN) patients. However, it remains elusive whether HKC can ameliorate the inchoate glomerular injuries in hyperglycemia. Recently the activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/serine-threonine kinase (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and its downstream regulator, 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K), play important roles in the early glomerular pathological changes of DN including glomerular hypertrophy, glomerular basement membrane (GBM) thickening and mild mesangial expansion. This study thereby aimed to clarify therapeutic effects of HKC during the initial phase of DN and its underlying mechanisms. Fifteen rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: the normal group, the model group and the HKC group. The early DN model rats were induced by unilateral nephrectomy combined with intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin, and administered with either HKC suspension or vehicle after modeling and for a period of 4 weeks. Changes in the incipient glomerular lesions-related parameters in urine and blood were analyzed. Kidneys were isolated for histomorphometry, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and Western blotting (WB) at sacrifice. In vitro, murine mesangial cells (MCs) were used to investigate inhibitory actions of hyperoside (HYP), a bioactive component of HKC, on cellular hypertrophy-associated signaling pathway by WB, compared with rapamycin (RAP). For the early DN model rats, HKC ameliorated micro-urinary albumin, body weight and serum albumin, but had no significant effects on renal function and liver enzymes; HKC improved renal shape, kidney weight and kidney hypertrophy index; HKC attenuated glomerular hypertrophy, GBM thickening and mild mesangial expansion; HKC inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR and p70S6K, and the protein over-expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 in kidneys. In vitro, the phosphorylation of PI3K, Akt, mTOR and p70S6K in MCs induced by high-glucose was abrogated by treatment of HYP or RAP. On the whole, this study further demonstrated HKC safely and efficiently alleviates the early glomerular pathological changes of DN, likely by inhibiting Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling activity in vivo and in vitro, and provided the first evidence that HKC directly contributes to the prevention of the early DN.

1	Linalool Affects the Antimicrobial Efficacy of Essential Oils.The high concentrations of essential oils are generally required to receive microbial purity of the products (cosmetics, medicine). On the other hand, their application due to the high concentration of essential oils may be limited by changes in organoleptic and textural quality of the products, as well as they cause irritation and allergies in users. Addition of linalool to essential oil may significantly enhance its antimicrobial effectiveness and reduce their concentrations in products, taking advantage of their synergistic and additive effects. The aim of the study was to compare antimicrobial activity of essential oil alone and in combination with linalool. The antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Thymus vulgaris, Juniperus communis, Pelargonium graveolens, Citrus bergamia, Citrus grandis, Lavandula angustifolia, Cinnamomum zeylanicum, Melaleuca alternifolia, Syzygium aromaticum, linalool and their combination was investigated against bacteria and fungi using the disc diffusion method. The addition of linalool to S. aromaticum oil in a synergistic manner enhanced its antimicrobial efficacy against P. aeruginosa and A. brasiliensis. Moreover, the additive interaction between this oil and linalool was observed against S. aureus, E. coli and C. albicans. It was also found that linalool in an additive manner increased the antimicrobial effectiveness of T. vulgaris oil against P. aeruginosa. The antimicrobial properties of mixture of essential oils with their active constituents may be used for creating new strategies to maintain microbiological purity of products. 	cinnamomum zeylanicum linalool
1	Fungicidal Activity of Essential Oils from Cinnamomum cassia against the Pathogenic Fungi of Panax notoginseng Diseases.The frequent disease of Panax notoginseng caused by the pathogenic fungi in field cultivation has become the major threaten to the sustainable development of it. The present study was conducted to find natural agent with potential inhibition against pathogen. Therefore, the inhibitory effects of Cinnamomum cassia (L.) J.Presl essential oils (EOs) against P. notoginseng associated pathogenic fungi were conducted both in vitro and in vivo experiments. The results of the Oxford cup test revealed that C. cassia dry bark EO (50 mg/mL) had significant inhibitory activity on the growth of all tested fungi, and the growth of various pathogens was completely inhibited, except for that of Fusarium solani. Therefore, the constituents of C. cassia EOs were analyzed by GC/MS, and the research demonstrated that the main constituents of C. cassia dry bark EO were trans-cinnamaldehyde (75.65 %), (E)-2-methoxycinnamaldehyde (6.08 %), cinnamaldehyde (3.47 %) and cinnamyl acetate (1.02 %). The MIC results showed that C. cassia dry bark EO and the main compounds had good antifungal effect on the tested strains, and the inhibitory effect was similar to that of hymexazol (chemical pesticide). By analyzing the value of the fraction inhibitory concentration index (FICI), additive effects, irrelevant effects and synergistic effects were observed after the mixture of hymexazol against various pathogens. Moreover, in vivo model showed that C. cassia dry bark EO could reduce the occurrence of anthrax in P. notoginseng. To widen the resources of C. cassia available, the compositions of both C. cassia fresh bark and leaf EOs were also tested and many common compositions existed among them. Taken together, it was concluded that C. cassia EO had the potential use in the field to reduce the pathogenic disease.	c. cassia cinnamaldehyde
2	Effect of four medicinal plants on amyloid-beta induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells.Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) is implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder. This study was designed to determine the effect of four medicinal plants used to treat neurodegenerative diseases on Abeta-induced cell death. Cytotoxicity of the ethanol extracts of the plants was determined against SH-SY5Y (human neuroblastoma) cells which were untreated, as well as toxically induced with Abeta, using the MTT and neutral red uptake assays. Cell viability was reduced to 16% when exposed to 20 microM Abeta25-35 for 72 h. The methanol extract of the roots of Ziziphus mucronata Willd., Lannea schweinfurthii (Engl.) Engl. and Terminalia sericea Burch. ex DC., were the least toxic to the SH-SY5Ycells at the highest concentration tested (100 microg/ml). All four plants tested were observed to reduce the effects of Abeta-induced neuronal cell death, indicating that they may contain compounds which may be relevant in the prevention of AD progression. 	lannea schweinfurthii (engl.) engl AD
1	Cinnamomum cassia Presl: A Review of Its Traditional Uses, Phytochemistry, Pharmacology and Toxicology.Cinnamomum cassia Presl is a tropical aromatic evergreen tree of the Lauraceae family, commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine. It is also a traditional spice, widely used around the world. This paper summarizes the achievements of modern research on C. cassia, including the traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacology and toxicology.

However, the modern studies of C. cassia are still not complete and more in-depth investigations need to be conducted in alimentotherapy, health product, toxicity and side effects, and more bioactive components and potential pharmacological effects need to be explored in the future.	c. cassia terpenoids
1	Evaluation of thermal-oxidative stability and antiglioma activity of Zanthoxylum tingoassuiba essential oil entrapped into multi- and unilamellar liposomes.Zanthoxylum tinguassuiba essential oil (ZtEO) contains alpha-bisabolol, a known antiglioma sesquiterpene, among other potentially active substances. Medical applications of this essential oil require advances in the design of distinctive carriers due to its low water solubility and easy degradation by heat, light, and oxygen. The aim of this work was to evaluate enhancement in oxidative stability and the ability to reduce glioblastoma cell viability of ZtEO loaded into liposomes. Multi- and unilamellar vesicles were prepared to carry ZtEO. By using thermal analysis, it was observed that thermal-oxidative stability of the liposomal ZtEO was enhanced, when compared to its free form. Liposomal ZtEO also presented significant apoptotic-inducing activity for glioma cells. These results show that liposomal systems carrying ZtEO may be a potential alternative for gliobastoma treatment.	Zanthoxylum alpha-bisabolol
1	Seasonal variation in the leaf essential oil composition of Zanthoxylum clava-herculis growing in Huntsville, Alabama.The seasonal variation in the chemical composition of the leaf essential oil of Zanthoxylum clava-herculis has been analyzed by GC-MS. Three individual trees were sampled four times during the course of the 2004 growing season. Notable differences were recorded in the essential oil yields from the three trees on the four collection dates; yields were highest in May and lowest in July. The leaf essential oils were made up of 25 components, largely menthane monoterpenoids, dominated by limonene (44-73%) and 1,8-cineole (16-43%), with lesser amounts of alpha-thujene, linalool, gamma-terpinene, and alpha-terpineol. The ratio of oxygenated monoterpenoids to monoterpene hydrocarbons generally increased during the season, largely reflected in the 1,8-cineole/limonene ratio.	zanthoxylum clava-herculis 1,8-cineole
1	Extraction optimization of polysaccharide from Zanthoxylum bungeanum using RSM and its antioxidant activity.Polysaccharide prepared from pericarp of Zanthoxylum bungeanum was proved to possess excellent antioxidant activities in vitro by using reducing ferric iron power, DPPH radical scavenging activity, chelating ferrous iron capacity, and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity assays in the present study. In those four antioxidant assay models, Z. bungeanum polysaccharide (ZBP) displayed prominent antioxidant activities with low EC50 values of 0.011, 0.021, 0.056 and 0.008 mg/mL, respectively. Moreover, the extraction process of ZBP was further optimized by response surface methodology combined with Box-Behnken design. The highest polysaccharide yield 13.96%, which agreed closely with the predicted yield 13.20%, was obtained under the optimal extraction conditions as follows: extraction temperature 89  C, extraction time 3h, ratio of water volume (mL) to raw material weight (g) 29 (v/w), and extraction number two times. The present research not only provide theoretical basis for exploitation of natural polysaccharide antioxidants, but also establish the foundation of large-scale production and further system utilization of ZBP.	z. bungeanum polysaccharide
3	Zizyphus jujuba and its active component jujuboside B inhibit platelet aggregation.The seeds of Zizyphus jujuba (SZJ), a famous oriental traditional medicine, have been reported to exhibit diverse activities in biological systems including the cardiovascular system. However, little information is available on its antiplatelet activity. This study was undertaken to investigate the antiplatelet effects of the ethanolic extract of SZJ (ESZJ) and of its principal components jujuboside A and B. In the in vitro platelet aggregation study, ESZJ exhibited significant and concentration-dependent inhibitory effects on collagen-, thrombin-, and AA-induced platelet aggregation. In addition, ESZJ-treated mice showed significantly the prolongation of bleeding times and the protection against thromboembolic attack. A comparison of the effects of jujuboside A and B on platelet aggregation revealed that only jujuboside B had potent inhibitory effects on collagen-, thrombin-, AA-, and ADP-induced aggregation. Jujuboside B also exhibited superior protection on thromboembolic model. Furthermore, jujuboside B had a significant inhibitory effect on collagen-induced thromboxane A2 production in rat platelets. This study describes the antiplatelet effects of ESZJ and of its active component jujuboside B, and its findings suggest that these agents be considered as components of preventive and therapeutic herbal drugs targeting cardiovascular diseases associated with platelet hyperaggregation.	jujuboside b platelet hyperaggregation
2	Evaluation of Abelmoschus moschatus extracts for antioxidant, free radical scavenging, antimicrobial and antiproliferative activities using in vitro assays.BACKGROUND: Abelmoschus moschatus Medik. leaves and seeds are considered as valuable traditional medicine. The aromatic seeds of this plant are aphrodisiac, ophthalmic, cardio tonic, antispasmodic and used in the treatment of intestinal complaints and check queasiness. To give a scientific basis for traditional usage of this medicinal plant, the seed and leaf extracts were evaluated for their antioxidant, free radical scavenging, antimicrobial and antiproliferative activities. METHODS: In this study, antioxidant, antimicrobial and antiproliferative activities of A. moschatus extracts were evaluated in a series of in vitro assay involving free radicals, reactive oxygen species and their IC50 values were also determined. The antioxidant activities of the seed and leaf extracts of A. moschatus were determined by total antioxidant, DPPH, and ferrous reducing antioxidant property (FRAP) methods. In addition, the antiproliferative activity was also evaluated using colorectal adenocarcinoma and retinoblastoma human cancer cell lines. Moreover, six bacterial reference strains, two gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus), four gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris and Salmonella enterica paratyphi) and one fungal strain (Candida albicans) were used to evaluate its antimicrobial activity. RESULTS: The results from this study showed that the antioxidant activities of A. moschatus as determined by the total phenol, flavonoids, total antioxidant and FRAP methods were higher in leaf than that of the seed extracts. On the other hand, the aqueous overnight seed extract (AMS-I) has shown significant radical scavenging activity as in 1, 1- Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical, superoxide and lipid peroxidation as compared to other seed and leaf extracts. The AMS-I and AML-IV have shown activity against six and seven microorganisms respectively. Simulteneously, AMS-IV and AML-IV have demonstrated potential antiproliferative activity against two human cell lines - Colorectal adenocarcinoma (COLO-205) and retinoblastoma (Y79). CONCLUSION: The seed and leaf extracts of A. moschatus possess significant antioxidant activity and could serve as free radical inhibitors or scavenger, or substitute, probably as primary antioxidants. The plant possesses moderate antibacterial activity against bacterial strains used in this study. Hydroalcoholic seed and leaf extracts also exhibited antiproliferative activity against two human cancer cell lines. A. moschatus may therefore, be a good candidate for functional foods as well as pharmaceutics.	a. moschatus colorectal adenocarcinoma
2	Efficacy and safety of Abelmoschus manihot for primary glomerular disease: a prospective, multicenter randomized controlled clinical trial.BACKGROUND: Abelmoschus manihot, a single medicament of traditional Chinese medicine, has been widely used to treat kidney disease. This is the first randomized controlled clinical trial to assess its efficacy and safety in patients with primary glomerular disease. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, open-label, multicenter, randomized, controlled, clinical trial. SETTING &amp; PARTICIPANTS: From May 2010 to October 2011, a total of 417 patients with biopsy-proven primary glomerular disease from 26 hospitals participated in the study. INTERVENTIONS: A manihot in the form of a huangkui capsule, 2.5 g, 3 times per day; losartan potassium, 50mg/d; or combined treatment, a huangkui capsule at 2.5 g 3 times per day, was combined with losartan potassium, 50mg/d. The duration of intervention was 24 weeks. OUTCOMES &amp; MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was change in 24-hour proteinuria from baseline after treatment. Change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from baseline after treatment was a secondary outcome. The 24-hour proteinuria was measured every 4 weeks and eGFR was measured at 0, 4, 12, and 24 weeks. RESULTS: Mean baseline urine protein excretion was 1,045, 1,084, and 1,073 mg/d in the A manihot, losartan, and combined groups, respectively, and mean eGFR was 108, 106, and 106 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively. After 24 weeks of treatment, mean changes in proteinuria were protein excretion of -508, -376, and -545 mg/d, respectively (P=0.003 for A manihot vs losartan and P&lt;0.001 for the combined treatment vs losartan). Mean eGFR did not change significantly. The incidence of adverse reactions was not different among the 3 groups (P&gt;0.05), and there were no severe adverse events in any group. LIMITATIONS: Results cannot be generalized to those with nephrotic syndrome or reduced eGFR. CONCLUSIONS: A manihot is a promising therapy for patients with primary kidney disease (chronic kidney disease stages 1-2) with moderate proteinuria.	abelmoschus manihot primary kidney disease
1	Looking for Arabidopsis thaliana peroxidases involved in lignin biosynthesis.Monolignol polymerization into lignin is catalyzed by peroxidases or laccases. Recently, a Zinnia elegans peroxidase (ZePrx) that is considered responsible for monolignol polymerization in this plant has been molecularly and functionally characterized. Nevertheless, Arabidopsis thaliana has become an alternative model plant for studies of lignification, filling the gaps that may occur with Z. elegans. The arabidopsis genome offers the possibility of performing bioinformatic analyses and data mining that are not yet feasible with other plant species, in order to obtain preliminary evidence on the role of genes and proteins. In our search for arabidopsis homologs to the ZePrx, we performed an exhaustive in silico characterization of everything from the protein to the transcript of Arabidopsis thaliana peroxidases (AtPrxs) homologous to ZePrx, with the aim of identifying one or more peroxidases that may be involved in monolignol polymerization. Nine peroxidases (AtPrx 4, 5, 52, 68, 67, 36, 14, 49 and 72) with an E-value greater than 1e-80 with ZePrx were selected for this study. The results demonstrate that a high level of 1D, 2D and 3D homology between these AtPrxs and ZePrx are not always accompanied by the presence of the same electrostatic and mRNA properties that indicate a peroxidase is involved in lignin biosynthesis. In summary, we can confirm that the peroxidases involved in lignification are among AtPrx 4, 52, 49 and 72. Their structural and mRNA features indicate that exert their action in the cell wall similar to ZePrx. 	arabidopsis thaliana lignin
2	Antitumor and proapoptotic effect of Abrus agglutinin derived peptide in Dalton's lymphoma tumor model.Abrus agglutinin peptide fractions obtained from 10 kD molecular weight cut off membrane permeate (10 kMP), was shown to have selective antiproliferative activity on several tumor cell lines with induction of apoptosis through mitochondrial pathway. The present study was designed to evaluate acute general toxicity and in vivo therapeutic effectiveness of 10 kMPP in Dalton's lymphoma (DL) mice model. The acute toxicity like body weight, peripheral blood cell count, lympho-hematological and biochemical parameters remained unaffected with 1mg/kg body weight and lower of 10 kMPP. The in vivo antitumor study indicated that there were 27%, 58.5% and 84.5% reduction in DL cell survival in 100, 200 and 500 microg/kg body weight of 10 kMPP, respectively. Analysis of the growth inhibitory mechanism in DL cells revealed nuclear fragmentation and condensation with appearance of the sub G0/G1 peak is indicative of apoptosis. Further, the Western blotting showed apoptosis was mediated by reduction in ratio of Bcl-2 and Bax protein expression, and activation of caspase-3 through release of cytochrome-c in DL cells. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed an effective antitumor response (53 ILS%) with dose of 500 microg/kg body weight. Our result showed that the novel peptides present in Abrus agglutinin possess potent antitumor properties which need to be further explored.	Abrus dalton's lymphoma

2	The influence of air-dispersed essential oils from lemon (Citrus limon) and silver fir (Abies alba) on airborne bacteria and fungi in hospital rooms.Airborne bacteria and fungi are an ongoing problem in hospitals. Because of the antimicrobial activities of essential oils (EOs) dispersion of EOs into the air may help to reduce this contamination. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the dispersion of selected EOs in reducing the microbial contamination in two hospital wards. The study was carried out at two wards of a 1,227-bed acute-care hospital in Austria. The concentration of airborne bacteria and fungi was measured in patient rooms before and after dispersion of a mixture of Citrus limon EO and Abies alba EO. Before dispersion of the EOs in both wards the mean concentration of bacteria was in a typical range (123 colony forming units (CFU) m-3 and 104 CFU m-3) while the mean concentration of fungi differed substantially (155 CFU m-3 and 28 CFU m-3). After dispersion of the EOs, a reduction in both bacterial and fungal contamination was observed. In the first two hours the mean concentration of airborne bacteria and fungi was reduced by approximately 40% and 30%-60% respectively. The selected EO mixture is effective in reducing the microbial contamination of the indoor air.	citrus limon essential oils

Twenty-four Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250 +- 20 g were induced with diabetes by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 60 mg/kg). Animals were randomly assigned to one of four groups (n = 6) and treated for eight weeks with normal saline (control, group A), 5 mg/kg of CcAgNPs (group B), 10 mg/kg of CcAgNPs (group C), or 200 mg/kg of Cc (group D). Body weight and fasting blood glucose (FBG) was measured weekly and fortnightly, respectively. At the end of experiments animals were euthanized, blood and kidney tissue samples were collected for biochemistry (oxidative stress markers and renal function parameters) and kidneys were harvested for histology (PAS and H.	c. cassia kidneys of diabetic
1	Phytochemical and biological activities of four wild medicinal plants.The fruits of four wild plants, namely, Capparis decidua, Ficus carica, Syzygium cumini, and Ziziphus jujuba, are separately used as traditional dietary and remedial agents in remote areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. The results of our study on these four plants revealed that the examined fruits were a valuable source of nutraceuticals and exhibited good level of antimicrobial activity. The fruits of these four investigated plants are promising source of polyphenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, and saponins. These four plants' fruits are good sources of iron, zinc, copper, manganese, selenium, and chromium. It was also observed that these fruits are potential source of antioxidant agent and the possible reason could be that these samples had good amount of phytochemicals. Hence, the proper propagation, conservation, and chemical investigation are recommended so that these fruits should be incorporated for the eradication of food and health related problems. 	capparis decidua saponins
1	Optimization of the extraction conditions and quantification by RP-LC analysis of three alkaloids in Zanthoxylum nitidum roots.CONTEXT: A classic traditional Chinese medicine, Zanthoxylum nitidum (Roxb.) DC. widely used in China, exhibits anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antianalgesic activities. Alkaloids are one of the main bioactive components. It is urgent to develop a simple and reliable method to determine the main alkaloids in Z. nitidum roots. OBJECTIVE: To determine the three alkaloids in Z. nitidum roots, a reversed-phase liquid chromatographic (RP-LC) method combined with an optimum extraction condition was established. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A method involving four-factor-three-level orthogonal array design including the extracting solvent and the RP-LC condition was assayed. Twenty batches were collected from different areas of the Guangxi Province at different harvesting times. The determined alkaloids were nitidine chloride (NC, 1), ethoxychelerythrine (2) and liriodenine (3). The stable mobile phase was a C18 packing, and the mobile phase was acetonitril-aqueous phosphoric acid-triethylamine-buffer solution. RESULTS: The optimum extraction and detection conditions have been determined in the process of quantification of Z. nitidum root alkaloids. The three alkaloids were detected simultaneously in the 20 batches of samples. The results clearly showed that alkaloid concentrations differed significantly among Z. nitidum collected from various collection areas. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: We have established an optimum extraction and detection conditions in the process of quantification the three alkaloids in Z. nitidum roots. From this research, the most influenced factor on Z. nitidum roots was the collecting location, and the next factor was the harvesting time. The collecting location and the harvesting time should be considered as the high-quality medicinal herbs factors.	z. nitidum nitidine chloride
2	In vitro anti-Helicobacter pylori action of 30 Chinese herbal medicines used to treat ulcer diseases.Infection by Helicobacter pylori has been ascertained to be an important etiologic impetus leading usually to chronic active gastritis and gastric ulcer with growing incidences worldwide. Utilizing as the test pathogen a standard and five clinic strains of Helicobacter pylori, the antibacterial action was assessed in vitro with ethanol extracts of 30 Chinese herbal medicines which have been frequently prescribed since ancient times for treating gastritis-like disorders. Among the 30 tested materials, the ethanol extracts of Abrus cantoniensis (Fabaceae), Saussurea lappa (Asteraceae) and Eugenia caryophyllata (Myrtaceae) were strongly inhibitory to all test strains (MICs: approximately 40 microg/ml), and Hippophae rhamnoides (Elaeagnaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii (Liliaceae), Magnolia officinalis and Schisandra chinensis (Magnoliaceae), Corydalis yanhusuo (Papaveraceae), Citrus reticulata (Rutaceae), Bupleurum chinense and Ligusticum chuanxiong (Apiaceae) substantially active with MICs close to 60.0 microg/ml. As to antibacterial actions of the aqueous extracts of the same drugs, those derived from Cassia obtusifolia (Fabaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii and Eugenia caryophyllata were remarkably inhibitory against all the six Helicobacter pylori strains (MICs: approximately 60 microg/ml). The work compared almost quantitatively the magnitude of the anti-Helicobacter pylori actions of the 30 most prescribed gastritis-treating Chinese herbal drugs, and located as well some source plants where potent anti-Helicobacter pylori phytochemicals could be characterized.	hippophae rhamnoides gastric ulcer
1	Phenolic content and antioxidant property of the bark extracts of Ziziphus mucronata Willd. subsp. mucronata Willd.BACKGROUND: Several plants traditionally used in treatment of a variety of infections in South Africa are reported in ethnobotanical surveys. Many of these plants including Ziziphus mucronata subsp. mucronata lack scientific reports to support their medicinal importance. METHODS: The antioxidant activities and phenolic contents of the acetone, ethanol and aqueous extracts of the stems of Z. mucronata subsp. mucronata were evaluated using in vitro standard methods. The total phenol, total flavonoids and proanthocyanidin content were determined spectrophotometrically. Quercetin, Tannic acid and catechin equivalents were used for these parameters. The antioxidant activities of the stem bark extracts of this plant were determined by ABTS, DPPH, and ferrous reducing antioxidant property (FRAP) methods. RESULTS: The quantity of the phenolic compounds, flavonoids and proanthocyanidins detected differ significantly in the various extracts. The phenolics were significantly higher than the flavonoids and proanthocyanidin contents in all the extracts investigated. The ferric reducing ability and the radical scavenging activities of the extracts were very high and dose-dependent. The ethanol extract had the highest antioxidant activity, followed by the acetone extract while the aqueous extract was the least active. Reacting with ABTS, the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were (0.0429 +- 0.04 mg/ml) for aqueous, (0.0317 +- 0.04 mg/ml) for acetone and (0.0306 +- 0.04 mg/ml) for ethanol extracts while they inhibited DPPH radical with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 0.0646 +- 0.02 mg/ml (aqueous), 0.0482 +- 0.02 mg/ml (acetone) and 0.0422 +- 0.03 mg/ml (ethanol). CONCLUSIONS: A correlation between the antioxidant activity and the total phenolic contents of the extracts indicated that phenolic compounds were the dominant contributors to the antioxidant activity of the plant. This study, therefore, demonstrated that Z. mucronata subsp. mucronata has strong antioxidant property and free radical scavenging capability.	z. mucronata subsp Quercetin

1	Anti-complementary activity of triterpenoides from fruits of Zizyphus jujuba.In order to determine on the anti-complement activity of triterpenes, following eleven triterpenoides were isolated from the fruits of the Zizyphus jujuba MILL: ceanothane-type triterpenes: colubrinic acid (1), zizyberenalic acid (11); lupane-type triterpenes: alphitolic acid (2), 3-O-cis-p-coumaroyl alphitolic acid (3), 3-O-trans-p-coumaroyl alphitolic acid (4), betulinic acid (7), betulonic acid (9); and oleanane-type triterpenes: 3-O-cis-p-coumaroyl maslinic acid (5), 3-O-trans-p-coumaroyl maslinic acid (6), oleanolic acid (8), oleanonic acid (10). These compounds were examined for their anti-complement activity against the classical pathway of the complement system. Among them, compounds 5, 6, and 8 exhibited significant anti-complement activity with IC(50) values of 101.4, 143.9, and 163.4 microM, respectively, whereas the ceanothane-type and the lupane-type triterpenes were inactive. This suggests that the oleanane-structure plays an important role in inhibiting the hemolytic activity of human serum against erythrocytes.	zizyphus jujuba triterpenes
1	[Inhibition of neutrophil adhesion by pectic galacturonans].The inhibition of the adhesion of neutrophils to fibronectin by the fragments of the main galacturonan chain of the following pectins was demonstrated: comaruman from the marsh cinquefoil Comarum polustre, bergenan from the Siberian tea Bergenia crassifolia, lemnan from the duckweed Lemna minor, zosteran from the seagrass Zostera marina, and citrus pectin. The parent pectins, except for comaruman, did not affect the cell adhesion. Galacturonans prepared from the starting pectins by acidic hydrolysis were shown to reduce the neutrophil adhesion stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (1.625 microM) and dithiothreitol (0.5 mM) at a concentration of 50-200 microg/ml. The presence of carbohydrate chains with molecular masses higher than 300, from 100 to 300, and from 50 to 100 kDa in the galacturonan fractions was proved by membrane ultrafiltration.	zostera marina galacturonan
1	Combined analysis by GC (RI), GC-MS and 13C NMR of the supercritical fluid extract of Abies alba twigs.Two samples (leaves and twigs) of Abies alba Miller from Corsica were extracted using supercritical CO2 and their chemical compositions were compared with those of the essential oils obtained from the same batch of plant material. In total 45 components were identified using combined analysis by GC (RI), GC-MS and 13C NMR. It was observed that the contents of monoterpenes (mainly represented by limonene, alpha-pinene and camphene) were significantly lower in the supercritical fluid extract (SFE) than in the essential oil (EO). Conversely, the proportions of sesquiterpenes were much higher in CO2 extracts than in essential oils (around 30% vs 4%). Cis-abienol, a diterpene alcohol, was identified only in SFE, and the proportions of this constituent (7.5% and 17.3%) were determined using quantitative 13C NMR since it was under estimated using the standard conditions of GC.	abies alba diterpene alcohol
1	In vitro activities of plant extracts on human Loa loa isolates and cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells.Loa loa, a filarial worm, can cause fatal encephalitis in humans. In an attempt to find alternatives to the standard treatments (ivermectin and diethylcarbamazine citrate), we tested 12 methanolic extracts of nine traditional plant remedies. The extracts (100-0.09 microg/ml) were incubated with 20 Loa loa microfilariae isolated from patients at 37 degrees C with 5% CO(2) in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal serum and antibiotics. Activity was evaluated 120 h later by counting live microfilariae under a microscope. Cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells was estimated by measuring 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2-5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide transformation to formazan at 450 nM in a spectrophotometer. The plants tested were Lophira alata, Greenwayodendron suaveolens, Uapaca togoensis, Zanthoxylum heitzii, Peperomia pellucida, Piptadeniastrum africanum, Petersianthus macrocarpus, Vernonia conferta, and Vernonia hymenolepis. Chemical screening showed that most of the extracts contained reducing sugars, tannin or polyphenols, sterols or triterpenes, saponosides, and alkaloids. None contained carotinoids and few contained flavonoids. The 50% lethal concentration ranged from 0.22 to 70.28 microg/ml, while the 50% inhibitory concentration for eukaryotic cells (IC(50)) ranged from 8.52 to 119.52 microg/ml. Extracts of P. macrocarpus (selectivity index = 72.16), P. africanum (13.69), Z. heitzii (12.11), and L. alata (9.26) were highly selective for L. loa.	p. africanum flavonoids
1	Seasonal variation in the leaf essential oil composition of Zanthoxylum clava-herculis growing in Huntsville, Alabama.The seasonal variation in the chemical composition of the leaf essential oil of Zanthoxylum clava-herculis has been analyzed by GC-MS. Three individual trees were sampled four times during the course of the 2004 growing season. Notable differences were recorded in the essential oil yields from the three trees on the four collection dates; yields were highest in May and lowest in July. The leaf essential oils were made up of 25 components, largely menthane monoterpenoids, dominated by limonene (44-73%) and 1,8-cineole (16-43%), with lesser amounts of alpha-thujene, linalool, gamma-terpinene, and alpha-terpineol. The ratio of oxygenated monoterpenoids to monoterpene hydrocarbons generally increased during the season, largely reflected in the 1,8-cineole/limonene ratio.	zanthoxylum clava-herculis essential oil
3	Simultaneous Detection of Flavonoids, Phenolic Acids and Alkaloids in Abri Herba and Abri Mollis Herba using Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry.INTRODUCTION: Abri Herba has remarkable properties, such as cleanup heat detoxification, dampness and activating blood circulation to dissipate blood stasis; as a result, it has been applied to treat acute or chronic hepatitis and mastitis. Abri mollis Herba is often used as Abri Herba. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was applied to compare the similarities and differences of the chemical compositions in the two types of medicinal materials. OBJECTIVE: To establish a high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous analysis of 15 flavonoids, two phenolic acids and three alkaloids in Abri Herba and Abri mollis Herba. METHODOLOGY: The chromatographic separation was performed on a C18 column with a mobile phase of methanol (A), acetonitrile (B) and 0.5% acetic acid in water (C) using gradient elution. The detection of the target compounds was performed in multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) mode using a hybrid quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with positive/negative ion-switching electrospray ionisation (ESI) source. RESULTS: The developed method is reliable, sensitive and specific. In addition, the method has been successfully applied to differentiate 15 batches of Abri Herba and 27 batches of Abri mollis Herba stems. Furthermore, a comparison of the contents among stems, roots and leaves from the same strain in seven batches of Abri mollis Herba and four batches of Abri Herba has also been performed. CONCLUSION: HPLC-MS/MS method is sensitive and selective and can be suitable for the reliable quality control of Abri mollis Herba and Abri Herba.	phenolic acids hepatitis and mastitis
4	Water extract of Cinnamomum cassia suppresses angiogenesis through inhibition of VEGF receptor 2 phosphorylation.Angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation, has been a major target for cancer therapy. Antiangiogenic herbal medicines are useful in the treatment of cancer. In this study, we found that a water extract of Cinnamomum cassia (CCWE) was a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis. In cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells, CCWE suppressed vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced proliferation, migration, invasion, tube formation, and intracellular signaling events such as phosphorylation of ERK, p38 and VEGFR2, and activation of matrix metalloproteinase. Furthermore, CCWE inhibited VEGF-induced vessel sprouting of rat aorta ex vivo. These findings might be of particular interest for drug development because VEGF signaling is a potential target for treatment of angiogenesis-associated diseases. 	VEGFR2 cancer
2	An unusual manifestation of Abrus precatorius poisoning: a report of two cases.Abrus precatorius seeds are highly toxic and are often ingested as a means of suicide in India. Hemorrhagic gastroenteritis with erosions, hemolysis, acute renal damage, hepatotoxicity with elevated liver enzymes, and seizures are common manifestations of toxicity. We report two cases of Abrus precatorius poisoning with raised intracranial pressure (ICP) and papilledema that have not been described earlier in literature. One patient recovered completely with conservative management to lower raised ICP while the other patient expired before effective treatment could be institutedd. The cases are being reported to propose the need for routine fundus examination and brain imaging in severe abrus poisoning with CNS toxicity, as early institution of treatment for cerebral edema measures may be life saving.	abrus precatorius seizures
1	Pressurized liquid extraction and GC-MS analysis for simultaneous determination of seven components in Cinnamomum cassia and the effect of sample preparation.A pressurized liquid extraction and GC-MS method was developed for simultaneous quantitative determination of the seven components, including cinnamaldehyde, copaene, cinnamic acid, coumarin, 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde, 2-methoxycinnamic acid and safrole in Cinnamomum cassia. The results showed that methanol and ethanol was not available for extraction of cinnamaldehyde and 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde due to aldol reaction. The developed method was validated to be sensitive, accurate and simple, and was successfully employed for the analysis of 15 samples of C. cassia. The contents of the investigated components were significantly variant and cinnamaldehyde is the most abundant compound, but safrole was not detected in all samples.	c. cassia copaene
1	Inhibitory effect of total flavone of Abelmoschus manihot L. Medic on NMDA receptor-mediated current in cultured rat hippocampal neurons.The modulatory effect of Total Flavone of Abelmoschus manihot L. Medic (TFA) on NMDA-activated current (I(NMDA)) was investigated in cultured rat hippocampal neurons using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. TFA rapidly and reversibly inhibited the I(NMDA) in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, TFA non-competitively inhibited the I(NMDA) by enhancement of the NMDA receptor desensitization. In addition, intracellular application of TFA did not alter the TFA inhibition of I(NMDA). These results suggest that the inhibition of the NMDA receptor response by TFA could be one of the mechanisms for TFA-mediated neuroprotective actions.	abelmoschus manihot Flavone
2	[Isolation of endophytic fungi from Zanthoxylum simulans and screening of its active strain].This study aims at making full use of microbial resources, and screening the active endophytic fungi of anti-rheumatoid arthritis from Zanthoxylum simulans. The endophytic fungi were cultured and isolated by tissue culture and scribing method, and the active strain of inhibiting the proliferation of human rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (HFLS-RA) was screened by MTT method. Morphological characteristics and rDNA ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 sequences were applied for the taxonomy of endophytic fungi. Strains were isolated from Z. simulans. Among them, MK-05, MK-17, MK-19, MK-23 having inhibiting activity to HFLS-RA, the IC50 were 0.367, 0.775, 0.689, 0.757 g L-1, respectively. By classic morphologic classification and sequencing the PCR-amplified rDNA ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 regions, four effective strains were identified as Botryosphaeria dothidea, Phomopsis sp., P. liquidambari and Diaporthe perseae. The active endophyic fungi that inhibited the proliferation of HFLS-RA were screened from Z. simulans for the first time, and the results lay the foundation for the development and utilization of the Z. simulans resources.	z. simulans rheumatoid arthritis synovial
1	Content variations of triterpenic acid, nucleoside, nucleobase, and sugar in jujube (Ziziphus jujuba) fruit during ripening.Jujube (Ziziphus jujuba) fruit is widely consumed as food and traditional Chinese medicine in Asian countries due to its potential effects for human health. To facilitate selection of the maturity stage providing optimum health benefits, jujube fruits were analysed at six stages of growth (S1-6) for triterpenic acids, nucleosides, nucleobases, and sugars by UHPLC-MS/MS or HPLC-ELSD methods. The content levels of most triterpenic acids and sugars increased with ripening, and reached the highest at S5 and S6, respectively. The accumulation of the cyclic nucleotides (cAMP and cGMP) was mainly in the later stage of ripening (S5-6). Therefore, if taking triterpenic acids as the major quality indicator, S5 should be the ideal time to harvest jujube fruit, and the full ripen stage (S6) maybe the best choice when taking sugars and cyclic nucleotides as the most important components. 	jujube triterpenic acid
1	Analysis of volatile components, fatty acids, and phytosterols of Abies koreana growing in Poland.Extracts and essential oils from seeds as well as essential oils from cone scales and needles with twigs of the Abies koreana population were studied. An analysis of Korean fir essential oils allowed us to determine 147 volatile compounds. The identified compounds constituted 97-99% of the seed, cone and needle oils. The main volatile in the seed and needle oils was limonene (56.6% and 23.4%, respectively), while the predominant volatile in cone oils was alpha-pinene (51.2%). Korean fir seeds provided a rich source of both essential oil (3.8-8.5%) and extract, which was isolated with a 24.5% yield and contained numerous groups of fatty acids and phytosterols (414 microg/100g extract). The most prominent fatty acids were unsaturated, among which linoleic (41.2%) and oleic (31.2%) fatty acid were the main ones while the dominant sterols were isomers of ergostadienol and beta-sitosterol. A. koreana seeds, cones and needles are a source of many volatile bioactive compounds while the seed extract, with a pleasant scent, contained not only volatiles, but also fractions rich in fatty acids and phytosterols. These facts make A. koreana essential oils and especially the seed extract potential components of cosmetics.	a. koreana alpha-pinene
2	Zanthoxylum bungeanum pericarp extract prevents dextran sulfate sodium-induced experimental colitis in mice via the regulation of TLR4 and TLR4-related signaling pathways.Zanthoxylum bungeanum, which belongs to the Zanthoxylum genus of the Rutaceae family, is now wildly distributed in most parts of China and some Southeast Asian countries. The pericarp of Zanthoxylum bungeanum has been known to exhibit antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and other important therapeutic activities. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects and mechanisms of Zanthoxylum bungeanum pericarp extract (ZBE) on DSS-induced experimental colitis in mice. The results demonstrated that the major flavonoid composition of ZBE includes rutin (32.36%), quercetin (13.61%) and isoquercitrin (24.89%). ZBE alleviated DSS-induced body weight loss, colon length shortening and colonic pathological damage. Furthermore, ZBE inhibited the expression of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-12 via the regulation of TLR4 and TLR4-related pathways in DSS-induced experimental colitis in mice and LPS-triggered inflammation in J774.1 cells. Our findings suggest that ZBE is effective in ameliorating experimental colitis, and further investigation is necessary on the use of ZBE as a new dietary strategy to lower the risk of ulcerative colitis (UC).	zanthoxylum bungeanum colitis
2	Cassia cinnamon does not change the insulin sensitivity or the liver enzymes in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance.BACKGROUND: Published studies have reported conflicting results regarding the effects of cinnamon on glucose, lipids and insulin. To gain further insight into the metabolic effects of Cinnamomum cassia we performed randomized, double-blinded placebo-controlled study using euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp. METHODS: Twenty-one subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) were included in the study (10 or 11 subjects in each group). The study groups were matched for age, gender and body mass index (BMI). Waist-to-hip ratio, BMI, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, insulin, triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein , HbA1c, ASAT, ALAT, bilirubin, ALP, GT and PK were measured before and after the intake of capsules equivalent to 6 g cinnamon twice a day for 12 weeks. The changes in insulin resistance were measured by euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp. The Wilcoxon signed rank sum test, the Mann-Whitney U test and Pearson's chi-squared test were used to analyse the data. Values of p &lt; 0.05 were considered to indicate statistically significant differences. RESULTS: At enrolment, the groups were similar in terms of age, gender and BMI. Of the 21 randomized patients with IGT, 17 completed the study (8 controls vs. 9 treated). The ingestion of 6 g cinnamon twice a day for 12 weeks had no significant effect on insulin sensitivity, HbA1c, fasting glucose or BMI. No significant changes were seen in lipids or liver enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that ingestion of 6 g C. cassia twice a day for 12 weeks did not change the insulin sensitivity or liver enzymes in subjects with IGT.	cinnamon impaired glucose tolerance
2	A survey of some Indian medicinal plants for anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) activity.BACKGROUND &amp; OBJECTIVES: India has an extensive area of forest enriched with plant diversity. Several of these plants have been used as folklore medicines. However, the medicinal plants have rarely been investigated for anti-human immunodeficiency virus activity. Hence, some Indian medicinal plants were screened in vitro against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). METHODS: The inhibitory effect of plant extracts on HIV replication was monitored in terms of inhibition of virus induced cytopathogenicity in MT-4 cells. The MT-4 cells were infected with HIV. The HIV infected or mock infected MT-4 cells were incubated at 37 degrees C in a CO2 incubator in the presence of the plant extracts. After five days, cell viability was measured by tetrazolium based colorimetric assay. RESULTS &amp; INTERPRETATION: Of the 69 plant species screened, 16 were effective against HIV-1 and 4 were against both HIV-1 and HIV-2. The most effective extracts against HIV-1 and HIV-2 are respectively Cinnamomum cassia (bark) and Cardiospermum helicacabum (shoot + fruit). The findings provide a rationale for further studies on isolation of active principles and pharmacological evaluation.	cinnamomum cassia hiv-1 and hiv-2
1	[Clinical observation on diabetic nephropathy treated with alcohol of Abelmoschus manihot].Sixty-eight cases of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) complicated with nephropathy were randomly divided into two groups: treated group, 35 cases treated with alcohol extraction of Abelmoschus manihot, Gliclazide and Captopril tablets; control group, 33 cases treated with Gliclazide and Captopril tablets, over a period of 8 weeks. The total effective rate in treated and control group were 83.87% and 31.03%(P &lt; 0.01), urinary micro-albumin were 31.7 mg/L and 76.3 mg/L (P &lt; 0.05), proteinuria were 0.41 g/24h and 0.77 g/24h (P &lt; 0.01), blood beta 2-microglobulin were 3317.8 ng/ml and 3473.1 ng/ml (P &lt; 0.05), urinary beta 2-microglobulin were 367.2 ng/ml and 641.5 ng/ml (P &lt; 0.01), urinary N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAG) were 26.3 u/L and 66.7 u/L (P &lt; 0.01), plasma lipid peroxide (LPO) were 6.13 nmol/L and 8.78 nmol/L (P &lt; 0.05), and plasma superoxide anion were 8.36 kcpm and 10.42 kcpm respectively (P &lt; 0.05). It was suggested that Abemoschus manihot alcohol extraction could eliminate oxygen free radicals, alleviate renal tubular-interstitial diseases, improve renal function and reduce proteinuria.	abelmoschus manihot diabetic nephropathy
2	Effect of Zanthoxylum schinifolium on TNF-alpha-induced vascular inflammation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells.Pro-inflammatory cytokines induce the injury of endothelial cells in response to increases of adhesion molecules, leading to vascular inflammation and the development of atherosclerosis. In this study, we evaluated an ethanol extract of Zanthoxylum schinifolium (EZS) to determine if it inhibits the expressions of cellular adhesion molecules in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). When pretreatment of HUVEC with EZS, EZS suppressed the expression levels of cell adhesion molecules such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-), and E-selectin induced by TNF-alpha. The adhesion of HL-60 cells to TNF-alpha-induced endothelial cells was decreased significantly in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, TNF-alpha-induced MCP-1 and IL-8 mRNA expression levels were also attenuated by pretreatment with EZS. In addition, EZS suppressed TNF-alpha-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). EZS inhibited NF-kappaB activation and IkappaB-alpha phosphorylation induced by TNF-alpha, subsequent degradation of IkappaB-alpha. Finally, EZS inhibited TNF-alpha-induced p38 MAPK and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation. Taken together, these results demonstrate that EZS suppresses vascular inflammatory process, which may be closely related to the inhibition of ROS, JNK, p38 MAPK and NF-kappaB activation in HUVEC.	zanthoxylum schinifolium vascular inflammation

METHOD: After obtaining the tumor inhibition rate and fingerprint peak data through MTT and HPLC, "chromatography-efficacy" relation was established by an appropriate statistical method. RESULT: The gastric cancer "chromatography-efficacy" relation of Z. nitidum was established by step-back technique. CONCLUSION: The "chromatography-efficacy" relation has statistically significant and practical significance, so it has reference value in some way.	z. nitidum gastric cancer
1	Anthelmintic efficacy of cinnamaldehyde and cinnamic acid from cortex cinnamon essential oil against Dactylogyrus intermedius.Utilization of chemical pesticide to control monogenean diseases is often restricted in many countries due to the development of pesticide resistance and concerns of chemical residues and environmental contamination. Thus, the use of antiparasitic agents from plants has been explored as a possible way for controlling monogenean infections. Extracts from Cinnamomum cassia were investigated under in vivo conditions against Dactylogyrus intermedius in goldfish. The two bioactive compounds, cinnamaldehyde and cinnamic acid, were identified using nuclear magnetic resonance and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The 48 h median effective concentrations (EC(50)) for these compounds against D. intermedius were 0 57 and 6 32 mg L(-1), respectively. The LD(50) of cinnamaldehyde and cinnamic acid were 13 34 and 59 66 mg L(-1) to goldfish in 48 h acute toxicity tests, respectively. These data confirm that cinnamaldehyde is effective against D. intermedius, and the cinnamaldehyde exhibits potential for the development of a candidate antiparasitic agent.	cinnamon cinnamic acid
3	Anti-inflammatory effect of cinnamaldehyde in Helicobacter pylori induced gastric inflammation.Cinnamomum cassia is widely employed for gastrointestinal complaints such as dyspepsia, flatulence, diarrhea, and vomiting. Studies report cinnamaldehyde (CM) as a major active constituent of cinnamon. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory mechanism of CM on Helicobacter (H.) pylori-infected gastric epithelial cells in order to validate cinnamon traditional use in gastrointestinal (GI)-related disorders. AGS/MKN-45 cells and H. pylori (193C) were employed for co-culture experiments. Anti-H. pylori cytotoxic and anti-adhesion activity of CM were determined. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, real time polymerase chain reaction analysis and immunoblotting were used to measure the effect on interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion/expression. The effect on activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) was determined by immunoblot analysis. The non-cytotoxic CM (&lt;=125 microM) was also non-bactericidal at the given time, suggesting the effect in H. pylori/cell co-culture system was not due to alteration in H. pylori viability or the toxicity to the cells. Also, CM did not show any anti-adhesion effect against H. pylori/cell co-culture. However, pre-incubation of the cells with CM significantly inhibited the IL-8 secretion/expression from H. pylori-infected cells (p&lt;0.01). In addition, CM suppressed H. pylori-induced NF-kappaB activation and prevented degradation of inhibitor (I)-kappaB This study provides evidence that the anti-inflammatory effect of C. cassia on H. pylori-infected gastric cells is due to blockage of the NF-kappaB pathway by cinnamaldehyde. This agent can be considered as a potential candidate for in vivo and clinical studies against various H. pylori related gastric pathogenic processes.	cinnamaldehyde gastric inflammation
2	Inhibition of Trypanosoma cruzi by plant extracts used in Chinese medicine.In this work, we assessed the effect of extracts obtained from 17 plants used in traditional Chinese medicine. These extracts were tested in vitro with the epimastigote form of Trypanosoma cruzi, clone Bra C(15) C(2), at 27 degrees C in F-29 medium at a concentration of 100 microg/ml in axenic cultures. Allopurinol was used as reference drug. Seven plant extracts showed inhibitory activities lower than 25%. Pueraria lobata, Mahonia beaei, Dictamus dasycarpus, Kochia scoparia, Sophora flavescens and Ligustrum lucidum showed effects with inhibition values between 25% and 60%, whereas Lithospermum erythrorhizon, Saussurea lappa, Melia toosendan and Cinnamomum cassia showed the greatest inhibitory activity of 100%. The IC(50) of these extracts were: 0.4, 2.4, 1.8 and 3.9 microg/ml, respectively. The MTT assay was made and did not show cytotoxic activity. These results allowed us to suggest that L. erythrorhizon, S. lappa, M. toosendan and C. cassia could be a source of new compounds against T. cruzi.	t. cruzi inhibitory activities
4	Regulation of Caspase-3 and Bcl-2 Expression in Dalton's Lymphoma Ascites Cells by Abrin.The role of abrin, a toxic lectin isolated from seeds of Abrus precatorius Linn in inducing apoptosis in murine Dalton's Lymphoma Ascites (DLA) cells was evaluated. Abrin when incubated at the concentration of 10 ng per million DLA cells could bring about cell death as typical morphological changes with apoptosis. However, necrotic cell death dominated when a higher dose of abrin was used. DNA samples, isolated from DLA cells treated with abrin showed fragmentation. Abrin brought about induction of apoptosis by stimulating the expression of pro-apoptotic Caspase-3, at the same time blocking the expression of Bcl-2, which is an anti apoptotic gene. However, the expression of tumor suppressor gene p53 has not been observed in control and abrin-treated DLA cells. Results suggested that abrin effectively induced apoptotic changes in the tumor cells that led to cellular death.	Caspase-3 tumor

3	The anti-diabetic effects and pharmacokinetic profiles of berberine in mice treated with Jiao-Tai-Wan and its compatibility.Jiao-Tai-Wan (JTW), a classical Chinese prescription, has been clinically employed to treat diabetes mellitus in recent years. To investigate the comparative evaluations on anti-diabetic effects and pharmacokinetics of the active ingredient berberine in mice treated with JTW in various combinations of its constituent herbs. In our study, the anti-diabetic study was carried out in diabetic mice induced by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. The diabetic mice were randomly assigned to three therapy groups and orally administered with different prescription proportions of Rhizoma Coptidis and Cinnamomum cassia respectively. The level of plasma glucose, lipid profile and parameters related to oxidative stress were determined. The concentrations of berberine in non-diabetic mice plasma were determined using HPLC, and main pharmacokinetic parameters were investigated. The results indicated that the compatibility effects of ingredients present in Cinnamomum cassia could affect the anti-diabetic ability and pharmacokinetics of berberine in JTW. 	berberine diabetic
1	Cinnamon and Chronic Diseases.Cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum and Cinnamon cassia), the eternal tree of tropical medicine, belongs to the Lauraceae family and is one of the most important spices used daily by people all over the world. It contains a lot of manganese, iron, dietary fiber, and calcium. Cinnamon contains derivatives, such as cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid, cinnamate, and numerous other components such as polyphenols and antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, anticancer effects. Several reports have dealt with the numerous properties of cinnamon in the forms of bark, essential oils, bark powder, and phenolic compounds, and each of these properties can play a key role in human health. Recently, many trials have explored the beneficial effects of cinnamon in Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, arthritis, and arteriosclerosis, but still we need further investigations to provide additional clinical evidence for this spice against cancer and inflammatory, cardioprotective, and neurological disorders.	cinnamon cinnamaldehyde
3	Synthesis, characterization, and in vitro antitumor properties of gold(III) compounds with the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) active ingredient liriodenine.Liriodenine, an oxoaporphine alkaloid with anticancer activity isolated from Zanthoxylum nitidum (rutaceous anticancer traditional Chinese medicine), was selected as a bioactive ligand to react with HAuCl(4) and NaAuCl(4) to afford [LH][AuCl(4)] (1) and [AuCl(3)L] (2), respectively (where L is liriodenine). The structures of 1 and 2 were characterized by IR spectroscopy, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, (1)H-NMR spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. The single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of 1 revealed that it is an ionic compound consisting of protonated liriodenine cation [LH](+) and [AuCl(4)](-) anion. The spectroscopic analysis showed that 2 is a coordination compound, in which one liriodenine coordinates to gold via its 7-N donor. In aqueous solution, 1 is relatively stable, but 2 undergoes rapid hydrolysis. The in vitro cytotoxicity towards five human tumor cell lines shows that 1 and 2 manifest roughly similar biological behavior and appreciable antiproliferative properties, with IC(50) values falling in the 2-16 muM range. The flow-cytometric analysis of 1 and 2 suggests that both compounds induced an S-phase arrest. Compounds 1 and 2 significantly poison topoisomerase I in vitro at low concentration (25 muM or less). DNA binding studies indicate that both 1 and 2 interact with DNA mainly via intercalation between the neighboring base pairs of the DNA double helix. Electrostatic interactions of 1 and 2 with the polyanionic DNA phosphate backbone may reinforce the intercalation because both 1 and 2 are composed of planar cationic species.	liriodenine tumor
1	Total flavone of Abelmoschus manihot suppresses epithelial-mesenchymal transition via interfering transforming growth factor-beta1 signaling in Crohn's disease intestinal fibrosis.AIM: To explore the role and mechanism of total flavone of Abelmoschus manihot (TFA) on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progress of Crohn's disease (CD) intestinal fibrosis. METHODS: First, CCK-8 assay was performed to assess TFA on the viability of intestinal epithelial (IEC-6) cells and select the optimal concentrations of TFA for our further studies. Then cell morphology, wound healing and transwell assays were performed to examine the effect of TFA on morphology, migration and invasion of IEC-6 cells treated with TGF-beta1. In addition, immunofluorescence, real-time PCR analysis (qRT-PCR) and western blotting assays were carried out to detect the impact of TFA on EMT progress. Moreover, western blotting assay was performed to evaluate the function of TFA on the Smad and MAPK signaling pathways. Further, the role of co-treatment of TFA and si-Smad or MAPK inhibitors has been examined by qRT-PCR, western blotting, morphology, wound healing and transwell assays. RESULTS: In this study, TFA promoted transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1)-induced (IEC-6) morphological change, migration and invasion, and increased the expression of epithelial markers and reduced the levels of mesenchymal markers, along with the inactivation of Smad and MAPK signaling pathways. Moreover, we revealed that si-Smad and MAPK inhibitors effectively attenuated TGF-beta1-induced EMT in IEC-6 cells. Importantly, co-treatment of TFA and si-Smad or MAPK inhibitors had better inhibitory effects on TGF-beta1-induced EMT in IEC-6 cells than either one of them. CONCLUSION: These findings could provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms of TFA on TGF-beta1-induced EMT in IEC-6 cells and TFA is expected to advance as a new therapy to treat CD intestinal fibrosis.	abelmoschus manihot flavone
1	Llama-derived single domain antibodies specific for Abrus agglutinin.Llama derived single domain antibodies (sdAb), the recombinantly expressed variable heavy domains from the unique heavy-chain only antibodies of camelids, were isolated from a library derived from llamas immunized with a commercial abrin toxoid preparation. Abrin is a potent toxin similar to ricin in structure, sequence and mechanism of action. The selected sdAb were evaluated for their ability to bind to commercial abrin as well as abrax (a recombinant abrin A-chain), purified abrin fractions, Abrus agglutinin (a protein related to abrin but with lower toxicity), ricin, and unrelated proteins. Isolated sdAb were also evaluated for their ability to refold after heat denaturation and ability to be used in sandwich assays as both capture and reporter elements. The best binders were specific for the Abrus agglutinin, showing minimal binding to purified abrin fractions or unrelated proteins. These binders had sub nM affinities and regained most of their secondary structure after heating to 95  C. They functioned well in sandwich assays. Through gel analysis and the behavior of anti-abrin monoclonal antibodies, we determined that the commercial toxoid preparation used for the original immunizations contained a high percentage of Abrus agglutinin, explaining the selection of Abrus agglutinin binders. Used in conjunction with anti-abrin monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, these reagents can fill a role to discriminate between the highly toxic abrin and the related, but much less toxic, Abrus agglutinin and distinguish between different crude preparations.	llamas abrax
1	Pressurized liquid extraction and GC-MS analysis for simultaneous determination of seven components in Cinnamomum cassia and the effect of sample preparation.A pressurized liquid extraction and GC-MS method was developed for simultaneous quantitative determination of the seven components, including cinnamaldehyde, copaene, cinnamic acid, coumarin, 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde, 2-methoxycinnamic acid and safrole in Cinnamomum cassia. The results showed that methanol and ethanol was not available for extraction of cinnamaldehyde and 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde due to aldol reaction. The developed method was validated to be sensitive, accurate and simple, and was successfully employed for the analysis of 15 samples of C. cassia. The contents of the investigated components were significantly variant and cinnamaldehyde is the most abundant compound, but safrole was not detected in all samples.	c. cassia 2-methoxycinnamic acid
3	Cinnamaldehyde Inhibits the Function of Osteosarcoma by Suppressing the Wnt/beta-Catenin and PI3K/Akt Signaling Pathways.Background: Osteosarcoma (OS) is a primary bone tumor associated with locally aggressive growth and early metastatic potential that typically occurs in children and adolescents. Chinese traditional medicine Cinnamomum cassia Presl has been shown to have significant tumor-killing effect, in which cinnamaldehyde (CA) is the main active ingredient. Purpose: To explore the anticancer effect of CA on the osteosarcoma cells and the possible molecular mechanism. Methods: Crystal violet assay, MTT assay and colony-forming assay were used to confirm the inhibitory role of CA in the proliferation of 143B and MG63 osteosarcoma cells. Hoechst 33258 staining and flow cytometry were used to observe apoptosis. The migration and invasion role of OS cells were evaluated using transwell assays and wound healing assays. Western blotting was used to analyse the protein expression levels. Nude mice were inoculated with 143B cells to establish an orthotopic OS tumor animal model and to investigate the effects of CA on OS tumors. Results: According to crystal violet assay, MTT assay and colony-forming assay, CA significantly inhibited cell proliferation. Hoechst 33258 staining and flow cytometry analysis showed that CA-induced apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, transwell assays and wound healing assays showed that CA inhibited the migration and invasion of osteosarcoma cells. In vivo mouse models, CA inhibited the growth of osteosarcoma. The potential mechanisms could be that CA inhibited the transcriptional activity of Wnt/beta-catenin and PI3K/Akt of the osteosarcoma. Conclusion: CA may inhibit the proliferation, migration, invasion and promote apoptosis of OS cells by inhibiting Wnt/beta-catenin and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. CA may be a potentially effective anti-tumor drug.	Cinnamaldehyde osteosarcoma

1	Isolation and structural characterization of a polysaccharide from fruits of Zizyphus jujuba cv. Junzao.A water-soluble polysaccharide (ZP2a) was obtained by extraction with hot water followed by successive chromatographic purification using anion exchange and Sepharose CL-6B columns. A symmetrical narrow peak was obtained on high-performance gel permeation chromatography with an average molecular weight of 120,645 Da, which was named ZP2a. ZP2a is composed of rhamnose, arabinose, glucose and galactose in the molar ratio 1.3:1.7:0.3:1. Based on gas chromatographic, infrared spectral, methylation and NMR analyses, ZP2a was structurally characterized as 1,4-D-GalpA residues interspersed with 1,2-L-Rhap and 1,2,4-L-Rhap residues. The branches were composed of 1,5-L-Araf, 1,3,5-L-Araf, 1,3-L-Araf, 1,6-D-Galp, 1,4,6-D-Galp and 1,4-D-Glcp. The branches were attached to the backbone at the O-4 position of Rhap residues.	zizyphus jujuba polysaccharide
2	Inhibition of xanthine oxidase by some Chinese medicinal plants used to treat gout.The enzyme xanthine oxidase catalyses the oxidation of hypoxanthine to xanthine and then to uric acid, which plays a crucial role in gout. A total of 122 traditional Chinese medicinal plants, selected according to the clinical efficacy and prescription frequency for the treatment of gout and other hyperuricemia-related disorders, have been evaluated for the enzyme inhibitory activity. Among the 122 methanol extracts derived from these species, 69 were shown to be inhibitory at 100 microg/ml, with 29 having greater than 50% inhibition. As to the equal amount of water extracts, 40 were disclosed to be active at 100 microg/ml, with 13 possessing more than 50% inhibition. At 50 microg/ml, 58 methanol and 24 water extracts exhibited inhibitory activity, with 15 of the former and two of the latter showing greater than 50% inhibition. The most active was the methanol extract of the twig of Cinnamomum cassia (Lauraceae) (IC(50), 18 microg/ml), which was followed immediately by those of the flower of Chrysanthemum indicum (Asteraceae) (IC(50), 22 microg/ml) and the leaves of Lycopus europaeus (Lamiatae) (IC(50), 26 microg/ml). Among the water extracts, the strongest inhibition of the enzyme was observed with that of the rhizome of Polygonum cuspidatum (Polygonaceae) (IC(50), 38 microg/ml). The IC(50) value of allopurinol used as a positive control was 1.06 microg/ml. The study demonstrated that the effects for these medicinal plants used for the gout treatment were based, at least in part, on the xanthine oxidase inhibitory action.	lycopus europaeus gout

2	Herbal medicines used in the treatment of malaria in Budiope county, Uganda.AIM OF THE STUDY: This study was conducted to document herbal medicines (HMs) used in the treatment of malaria as well as the existing knowledge, attitudes and practices related to malaria recognition, control and treatment in Budiope county, Uganda. METHODS: Data was collected using semi-structured interviews, and open- and close-ended questionnaires. RESULTS: The respondents had a good understanding of malaria, and could recognize it and distinguish it from other fever types. They were also aware that malaria was spread by mosquitoes. Malaria prevalence was high, and affected individuals an average of six times a year. Respondents avoided mosquito bites by using mosquito nets, clearing bush around their homesteads, and burning plant parts to generate smoke. They preferred treating malaria using allopathic medicines because, according to them, they lacked the appropriate traditional knowledge necessary to exploit plants for the treatment of malaria. Secondly, allopathic medicines were believed to be superior to HMs in the treatment of malaria. Twenty-seven species were used for the treatment of malaria. The most frequently mentioned were Vernonia amygdalina, Momordica foetida, Zanthoxylum chalybeum, Lantana camara and Mangifera indica. Drugs from these plants were prepared from single species as water extracts and were administered in variable doses over varied time periods.	zanthoxylum chalybeum malaria
2	Involvement of tannins and flavonoids in the in vitro effects of Newbouldia laevis and Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides extracts on the exsheathment of third-stage infective larvae of gastrointestinal nematodes.The present study aimed at examining the possible role of tannins and flavonoids on the in vitro anthelmintic properties of the extracts of two plants from the southern area of Western Africa, i.e. Newbouldia laevis and Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides. Extracts of the two plants were prepared by use of acetone/water (70/30) and their anthelmintic activity was measured by use of the larval exsheathment inhibition assay (LEIA) applied on the abomasal species, Haemonchus contortus and the intestinal species Trichostrongylus colubriformis. Three concentrations of extracts were evaluated to examine the possible dose effect. In addition, the possible involvement of tannins and flavonoids was examined by comparing the levels of inhibition of larval exsheathment obtained with the same extracts, after of not addition of PVPP which forms complexes with these compounds. The results indicate significant effects with both plants and both nematode species. In the range of concentrations examined, the results were dose-dependent for N. laevis extracts but not for Z. zanthoxyloides because the three doses applied provoked a similar highly significant inhibition whatever the tested dose. The use of PVPP indicated for both plant and nematode species, that tannins and flavonoids are involved partly in the effect but that some other biochemical compounds were also involved in both plants.	z. zanthoxyloides gastrointestinal nematodes
1	Components and insecticidal activity against the maize weevils of Zanthoxylum schinifolium fruits and leaves.In our screening program for new agrochemicals from Chinese medicinal herbs and wild plants, Zanthoxylum schinifolium essential oils were found to possess strong insecticidal activity against the maize weevil Sitophilus zeamais. The essential oils of Z. schinifolium fruits and leaves were extracted via hydrodistillation and investigated by GC and GC-MS. Estragole (69.52%) was the major compound of the essential oil of fresh fruits, followed by linalool (8.63%) and limonene (4.34%) and 94.33% of the total components were monoterpenoids. The main components of the essential oil of fresh leaves were linalool (12.94%), ar-tumerone (8.95%), limonene (6.45%) and elixene (5.43%) and only 50.62% were monoterpenoids. However, the essential oil from purchased fruits contained linalool (33.42%), limonene (13.66%) and sabinene (5.72%), followed by estragole (4.67%), nerol (4.56%) and 4-terpineol (4.27%). Estragole, linalool and sabinene were separated and purified by silica gel column chromatography and preparative thin layer chromatography, and further identified by means of physicochemical and spectrometric analysis. The essential oil from the fresh fruits (LD50 = 15.93 mug/adult) possessed two times more toxicity to the insects compared with that of fresh leaves (LD50 = 35.31 mug/adult). Estragole, linalool and sabinene exhibited contact activity against S. zeamais with LD50 values of 17.63, 13.90 and 23.98 mug/adult, respectively. The essential oils of Z. schinifolium possessed strong fumigant toxicity against S. zeamais adults with LC50 values of 13.19 mg/L (fresh fruits), 24.04 mg/L (fresh leaves) and 17.63 mg/L (purchased fruits). Estragole, linalool and sabinene also exhibited strong fumigant toxicity against the maize weevils with LC50 values of 14.10, 10.46 and 9.12 mg/L, respectively.	maize weevils Estragole
2	Synthesis and in vitro cytotoxicity of cinnamaldehydes to human solid tumor cells.Cinnamaldehydes and related compounds were synthesized from various cinnamic acids based on the 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde isolated from the bark of Cinnamomum cassia Blume. The cytotoxicity to human solid tumor cells such as A549, SK-OV-3, SK-MEL-2, XF498 and HCT15 were measured. Cinnamic acid, cinnamates and cinnamyl alcohols did not show any cytotoxicity against the human tumor cells. Cinnamaldehydes and related compounds were resistant to A549 cell line up to 15 micrograms/ml. In contrast, HCT15 and SK-MEL-2 cells were much sensitive to these cinnamaldehyde analogues which showed ED50 values 0.63-8.1 micrograms/ml. Cytotoxicity of the saturated aldehydes was much weak compared to their unsaturated aldehydes. From these studies, it was found that the key functional group of the cinnamaldehyde-related compounds in the antitumor activity is the propenal group.	cinnamomum cassia tumor
0	Hydroxy-alpha-sanshool activates TRPV1 and TRPA1 in sensory neurons.Sanshools are major active ingredients of Zanthoxylum piperitum and are used as food additives in East Asia. Sanshools cause irritant, tingling and sometimes paresthetic sensations on the tongue. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the pungent or tingling sensation induced by sanshools is not known. Because many transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are responsible for the sensations induced by various spices and food additives, we expressed 17 TRP channels in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells and investigated their activation by hydroxy-alpha-sanshool (HalphaSS) or hydroxy-beta-sanshool (HbetaSS) isolated from Zanthoxylum piperitum. It was found that HalphaSS, but not HbetaSS, depolarized sensory neurons with concomitant firing of action potentials and evoked inward currents. Among 17 TRP channels expressed in HEK cells, HalphaSS caused Ca(2+) influx in cells transfected with TRPV1 or TRPA1, and evoked robust inward currents in cells transfected with TRPV1 or TRPA1. In primary cultured sensory neurons, HalphaSS induced inward currents and Ca(2+) influx in a capsazepine-dependent manner. Moreover, HalphaSS-induced currents and Ca(2+) influx were greatly diminished in TRPV1(-/-) mice. HalphaSS evoked licking behavior when injected into a single hind paw of wild-type mice, but this was much reduced in TRPV1-deficient mice. These results indicate that TRPV1 and TRPA1 are molecular targets of HalphaSS in sensory neurons. We conclude that the activations of TRPV1 and TRPA1 by HalphaSS explain its unique pungent, tingling sensation.	HalphaSS TRPV1
1	Synergistic antioxidant activity of green tea with some herbs.Cardiovascular diseases, cancer, arthritis, etc. are caused by free radicals that are byproducts of metabolic pathways. Selected plants namely Vitis vinifera, Phyllanthus emblica L., Punica granatum, Cinnamomum cassia, Ginkgo biloba L., and Camellia sinensis Linn. are reported to produce antioxidant property. This study is undertaken to support the hypothesis that formulation of a polyherbal combination of these plants shows a synergistic effect with green tea. The extracts of each drug were characterized by phytochemical studies and tests for phenolics and flavonoids. In vitro antioxidant activity for individual drug and its combination was determined by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), superoxide, and nitric oxide free radical scavenging methods. Our results suggest that a combination of all these herbs with green tea can synergistically enhance antioxidant activity and thus lower doses of each herb with green tea may be used. Antioxidant potential of polyherbal combination was also comparable to that of standard ascorbic acid. Studies showed that selected individual plants contained abundant quantity of phenolics and flavonoids and their polyherbal combination with green tea was found to produce best antioxidant activity among all individual extracts. This will help in avoiding undesirable side effects due to higher doses of single herb.	punica granatum flavonoids
1	Selective stimulation by cinnamaldehyde of progesterone secretion in human adrenal cells.AIMS: Cinnamon bark has been used to treat menstrual pain and infertility. While several pharmacological studies have suggested anti-inflammatory properties, the mechanisms by which the herb exerts its various activities have not been well understood. Recent reports suggest menstrual distress is related to higher estradiol levels, higher estradiol/progesterone ratios. Cinnamaldehyde, a major active constituent of Cinnamomum cassia has been shown to stimulate cathecholamine release from adrenal glands. The objective of the present study is to examine whether cinnamaldehyde stimulates secretion of progesterone and other steroid hormones in human adrenal cells. MAIN METHODS: Human adrenal cells, H295R were exposed for 24h in a serum-free medium to various concentrations of cinnamaldehyde. Steroid hormones in the cultured medium were measured by a highly sensitive LC-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. KEY FINDINGS: Exposure to cinnamaldehyde increased progesterone release in a dose-dependent manner. Testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone concentrations decreased in the presence of cinnamaldehyde. The release of cortisol or estradiol was not affected by treatment with cinnamaldehyde. cAMP in the cultured medium was increased from 0.06+/-0.0007pmol/ml to 0.12+/-0.0028pmol/ml by exposure to cinnamaldehyde. The addition of isobutylmehtylxanthine, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, caused a doubling of the amount of cAMP up to 0.397+/-0.036pmol/ml in the presence of cinnamaldehyde. SIGNIFICANCE: These data suggest that cinnamaldehyde selectively induced progesterone production and inhibited production of testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone in human adrenal cells.	cinnamomum cassia cinnamaldehyde
2	Evaluation of abrin induced nephrotoxicity by using novel renal injury markers.Abrin is a potent plant toxin analogous to ricin that is derived from the seeds of Abrus precatorius plant. It belongs to the family of type II ribosome-inactivating proteins and causes cell death by irreversibly inactivating ribosomes through site-specific depurination. In this study we examined the in vivo nephrotoxicity potential of abrin toxin in terms of oxidative stress, inflammation, histopathological changes and biomarkers of kidney injury. Animals were exposed to 0.5 and 1.0 LD50 dose of abrin by intraperitoneal route and observed for 1, 3, and 7 day post-toxin exposure. Depletion of reduced glutathione and increased lipid peroxidation levels were observed in abrin treated mice. In addition, abrin also induced inflammation in the kidneys as observed through expression of MMP-9 and MMP-9/NGAL complex in abrin treated groups by using zymography method. Nephrotoxicity was also evaluated by western blot analysis of kidney injury biomarkers including Clusterin, Cystatin C and NGAL, and their results indicate severity of kidney injury in abrin treated groups. Kidney histology confirmed inflammatory changes due to abrin. The data generated in the present study clearly prove the nephrotoxicity potential of abrin.	abrus precatorius nephrotoxicity

2	Immunomodulatory activity of the aqueous extract of seeds of Abrus precatorius Linn (Jequirity) in mice.BACKGROUND: Various compounds of plant origin have been widely investigated since ancient times for their possible immunomodulatory properties as well as for the treatment of a wide range of diseases. OBJECTIVE: To study the immunomodulatory functions of the aqueous extract of the seeds of Abrus precatorius commonly known as Indian liquorice (Fabaceae), a medicinal plant native to central India. METHODS: Swiss albino mice were intraperitoneally treated with three doses (0.75, 1.25 and 2.5 microg/kg b.w.) of extract for 7 days. Relative organ weight, delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) response, haemagglutination titre (HT) and Phagocytic index (PI) were studied in various groups of animals. RESULTS: The results showed no significant difference in relative organ weight of spleen, liver, thymus and kidney in various groups of animals. Treatment of rats with increasing concentrations of the extract decreased the footpad thickness indicating a dose related inhibitory effect of the extract on delayed type hypersensitivity. In the HT test, the plant extract showed a suppressive effect at all doses, and these changes were significant as the dose increased. Phagocytic index was also increased in a dose dependent manner. CONCLUSION: The reduction of antibody titre, delayed type hypersensitivity response and the increase in phagocytic index indicates that Abrus precatorius has an inhibitory effect on the immune functions in mice.	abrus precatorius HT
1	Cinnamomulactone, a new butyrolactone from the twigs of Cinnamomum cassia and its inhibitory activity of matrix metalloproteinases.Cinnamomum cassia (Lauraceae) has long been used as one of the most frequently used traditional oriental medicines for the treatment of gastritis, diabetes, blood circulation disturbance and inflammatory diseases. Cinnamomulactone (1), a new butyrolactone was isolated from the twigs of C. cassia together with nine known compounds, coumarin (2), trans-cinnamic acid (3), cinnamaldehyde (4), 2-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (5), 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde (6), 2-hydroxy-cinnamyl alcohol (7), benzoic acid (8), (+)-syringaresinol (9) and phenethyl (E)-3-[4-methoxyphenyl]-2-propenoate (10). The planar structure of 1 was elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic data analysis and its configurations were determined by coupling constant (3 J HH) analysis and a comparison with specific rotation data of related compounds on the literatures. The structures of known compounds were confirmed by the comparison of their spectroscopic data to the reported values. Compound 10 was isolated for the first time from this plant. Compounds 1, 2, 4, and 9 showed inhibitory activity against matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) gene expression. Among them, compound 1 has been revealed to suppress the gene expression of MMP-3 and interleukin (IL)-1beta as well as MMP-1 in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha stimulated rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts.	c. cassia Cinnamomulactone
1	Cinnamon extract induces tumor cell death through inhibition of NFkappaB and AP1.BACKGROUND: Cinnamomum cassia bark is the outer skin of an evergreen tall tree belonging to the family Lauraceae containing several active components such as essential oils (cinnamic aldehyde and cinnamyl aldehyde), tannin, mucus and carbohydrate. They have various biological functions including anti-oxidant, anti-microbial, anti-inflammation, anti-diabetic and anti-tumor activity. Previously, we have reported that anti-cancer effect of cinnamon extracts is associated with modulation of angiogenesis and effector function of CD8+ T cells. In this study, we further identified that anti-tumor effect of cinnamon extracts is also link with enhanced pro-apoptotic activity by inhibiting the activities NFkappaB and AP1 in mouse melanoma model. METHODS: Water soluble cinnamon extract was obtained and quality of cinnamon extract was evaluated by HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) analysis. In this study, we tested anti-tumor activity and elucidated action mechanism of cinnamon extract using various types of tumor cell lines including lymphoma, melanoma, cervix cancer and colorectal cancer in vitro and in vivo mouse melanoma model. RESULTS: Cinnamon extract strongly inhibited tumor cell proliferation in vitro and induced active cell death of tumor cells by up-regulating pro-apoptotic molecules while inhibiting NFkappaB and AP1 activity and their target genes such as Bcl-2, BcL-xL and survivin. Oral administration of cinnamon extract in melanoma transplantation model significantly inhibited tumor growth with the same mechanism of action observed in vitro. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that anti-tumor effect of cinnamon extracts is directly linked with enhanced pro-apoptotic activity and inhibition of NFkappaB and AP1 activities and their target genes in vitro and in vivo mouse melanoma model. Hence, further elucidation of active components of cinnamon extract could lead to development of potent anti-tumor agent or complementary and alternative medicine for the treatment of diverse cancers.	cinnamomum cassia cinnamyl aldehyde
1	Radical Scavenging Activity of the Essential Oil of Silver Fir (Abies alba).The essential oil of silver fir (Abies alba) is known to help respiratory system and have easing and soothing effect for muscle. In the present study, we investigated the chemical composition, cytotoxicity and its biological activities of silver fir (Abies alba) essential oil. The composition of the oil was analyzed by GC-MS and bornyl acetate (30.31%), camphene (19.81%), 3-carene (13.85%), tricyclene (12.90%), dl-limonene (7.50%), alpha-pinene (2.87%), caryophyllene (2.18%), beta-phellandrene (2.13%), borneol (1.74%), bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene,2,3-dimethyl (1.64%) and alpha-terpinene (1.24%) were the major components in the oil. The results tested by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay indicated that the oil showed no cytotoxic effect, at concentrations of 1 and 5%, for as long as 24 and 3 h, respectively. The antiradical capacity was evaluated by measuring the scavenging activity of the essential oil on the 2,20-diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azino-bis 3-ethyl benzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) radicals. The oil was able to reduce the both radicals dose-dependently, and the concentration required for 50% reduction (RC(50)) against DPPH radicals (2.7 +/- 0.63%) was lower than ABTS radicals (8.5 +/- 0.27%). The antibacterial activity of the oil was also evaluated using disc diffusion method against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Listeria monocytogenes, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, and Vibrio parahaemolyticcus. The oil exhibited no antibacterial activity against all the bacterial strains tested except S. aureus of mild activity.	abies alba 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide
3	Estimation of Bioactive Compound, Maslinic Acid by HPTLC, and Evaluation of Hepatoprotective Activity on Fruit Pulp of Ziziphus jujuba Mill. Cultivars in India.Fruits of Ziziphus jujuba Mill. (family: Rhamnaceae), known as Indian jujube or "Ber," are of potential nutritional and medicinal value. The objectives of the present study were to estimate bioactive compound maslinic acid by HPTLC method and to evaluate in vitro antioxidant and hepatoprotective activity of eight cultivars of Indian jujube. Maslinic acid and the fruit pulp of various cultivars of Indian jujube, namely, Gola, Sannur, Umaran, Mehrun, and Chhuhara, exhibited significantly high antioxidant and hepatoprotective activity. HPTLC-densitometric method was developed for quantification of maslinic acid from fruits of Indian jujube cultivars. The trend of occurrence of maslinic acid in fruits pulp extracts was as follows: Gola &gt; Sannur &gt; Umaran &gt; Mehrun &gt; Chhuhara &gt; Wild &gt; Kadaka &gt; Apple. A significant correlation was shown by maslinic acid content and prevention of oxidative stress induced by CCl4 in liver slice culture cell treated with extract. Maslinic acid along with its other phytoconstituents like phenols, flavonoids, and ascorbic acid may act as a possible therapeutic agent for preventing hepatotoxicity caused by oxidative stress generated due to the prooxidants like CCl4. This is the first report of fruit pulp extracts of Z. jujube cultivars in India and maslinic acid preventing CCl4 induced damage in liver slice culture cell of mice. 	maslinic acid hepatotoxicity
2	The effect of medicinal plants of Islamabad and Murree region of Pakistan on insulin secretion from INS-1 cells.In vitro testing of the extracts of medicinal plants collected from Islamabad and the Murree region on insulin secretagogue activity was carried out. Dried ethanol extracts of all plants (ZH1-ZH19) were dissolved in ethanol and DMSO, and tested at various concentrations (between 1 and 40 microg/mL) for insulin release from INS-1 cells in the presence of 5.5 mM glucose. Glibenclamide was used as a control. Promising insulin secretagogue activity in various plant extracts at 1, 10, 20 and 40 microg/mL was found, while in some cases a decrease in insulin secretion was also observed. Artemisia roxburghiana, Salvia coccinia and Monstera deliciosa showed insulin secretagogue activity at 1 microg/mL (p &lt; 0.05) while Abies pindrow, Centaurea iberica and Euphorbia helioscopia were active at 10 microg/mL (p &lt; 0.05). Extracts of Bauhinia variegata and Bergenia himalacia showed effects at 20 microg/mL (p &lt; 0.05), and Taraxacum officinale and Viburnum foetens at 40 microg/mL (p &lt; 0.05). Insulin secretagogue activity could not be detected in the extracts of Adhatoda vasica, Cassia fistula, Chrysanthemum leucanthemum, Morus alba, Plectranthus rugosus, Peganum harmala and Olea ferruginea. The results suggest that medicinal plants of Islamabad and the Murree region of Pakistan may be potential natural resources for antidiabetic compounds.	abies pindrow insulin secretion
1	Content variations of triterpenic acid, nucleoside, nucleobase, and sugar in jujube (Ziziphus jujuba) fruit during ripening.Jujube (Ziziphus jujuba) fruit is widely consumed as food and traditional Chinese medicine in Asian countries due to its potential effects for human health. To facilitate selection of the maturity stage providing optimum health benefits, jujube fruits were analysed at six stages of growth (S1-6) for triterpenic acids, nucleosides, nucleobases, and sugars by UHPLC-MS/MS or HPLC-ELSD methods. The content levels of most triterpenic acids and sugars increased with ripening, and reached the highest at S5 and S6, respectively. The accumulation of the cyclic nucleotides (cAMP and cGMP) was mainly in the later stage of ripening (S5-6). Therefore, if taking triterpenic acids as the major quality indicator, S5 should be the ideal time to harvest jujube fruit, and the full ripen stage (S6) maybe the best choice when taking sugars and cyclic nucleotides as the most important components. 	jujube cyclic nucleotides
3	Selective stimulation by cinnamaldehyde of progesterone secretion in human adrenal cells.AIMS: Cinnamon bark has been used to treat menstrual pain and infertility. While several pharmacological studies have suggested anti-inflammatory properties, the mechanisms by which the herb exerts its various activities have not been well understood. Recent reports suggest menstrual distress is related to higher estradiol levels, higher estradiol/progesterone ratios. Cinnamaldehyde, a major active constituent of Cinnamomum cassia has been shown to stimulate cathecholamine release from adrenal glands. The objective of the present study is to examine whether cinnamaldehyde stimulates secretion of progesterone and other steroid hormones in human adrenal cells. MAIN METHODS: Human adrenal cells, H295R were exposed for 24h in a serum-free medium to various concentrations of cinnamaldehyde. Steroid hormones in the cultured medium were measured by a highly sensitive LC-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. KEY FINDINGS: Exposure to cinnamaldehyde increased progesterone release in a dose-dependent manner. Testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone concentrations decreased in the presence of cinnamaldehyde. The release of cortisol or estradiol was not affected by treatment with cinnamaldehyde. cAMP in the cultured medium was increased from 0.06+/-0.0007pmol/ml to 0.12+/-0.0028pmol/ml by exposure to cinnamaldehyde. The addition of isobutylmehtylxanthine, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, caused a doubling of the amount of cAMP up to 0.397+/-0.036pmol/ml in the presence of cinnamaldehyde. SIGNIFICANCE: These data suggest that cinnamaldehyde selectively induced progesterone production and inhibited production of testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone in human adrenal cells.	cinnamaldehyde menstrual pain
2	Medicinal Plants Targeting Cardiovascular Diseases in View of Avicenna.BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a spectrum of diseases involving the heart and blood vessels, and the first cause of mortality worldwide. Medicinal plants have been used for thousands of years to treat CVD. In Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM), there is a special focus on heart diseases. Avicenna, a Persian physician of the eleventh century compiled a book devoted to this field named "The treatise on cardiac drugs" which is a compendium of TPM knowledge on CVD. Avicenna mentioned 50 cardiovascular active plants and described their therapeutic effects in the treatment of CVDs. METHODS: Here, we perform a detailed search in scientific databases to verify the cardiovascular activities of the medicinal plants suggested by Avicenna. Also, we discussed cardiovascular activities of a number of the most important suggested plants as well as their efficacy in clinical studies. Major bioactive compounds identified from these plants are also discussed. RESULTS: Pharmacological studies have revealed that the majority of these plants are effective in cardiovascular health with various mechanisms. Among them, Crocus sativus L., Cinnamomum cassia (L.) J. Presl, Punica granatum L., Ocimum basilicum L., Elettaria cardamomum (L.) Maton, Melissa officinalis L. and Phyllanthus emblica L. have proved to be more effective. CONCLUSION: The above-mentioned plants can be rich sources for developing new and effective pharmaceuticals for the treatment of CVDs.	punica granatum l cardiovascular disease
1	Dietary Ziziphus jujuba Fruit Influence on Aberrant Crypt Formation and Blood Cells in Colitis-Associated Colorectal Cancer in Mice.Ziziphus jujuba (ZJ) fruit is rich in bioactive functional components such as polysaccharides, triterpenoid acid, flavonoids and oleamide. It has been commonly used in the treatment of various diseases including diabetes, digestive disorders, diarrhea, skin infections, liver and urinary complaints. However, dietary effects with regard to chemoprevention of colon cancer have not been studied. The present study was performed to evaluate the protective effects of dietary ZJ against colitis-associated colon carcinogenesis in azoxymethane (AOM)-dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)-treated mice. AOM was injected (10 mg/kg b.wt., i.p.) and three cycles of 2% DSS in drinking water for 7 days with 14 days of normal drinking water in-between were administered to induce colitis-associated colon cancer. ZJ fruit was supplemented into feed at levels of 5 and 10%. Dietary ZJ significantly attenuated aberrant crypt foci (ACF) formation and also decreased the progression of hyperplasia to dysplasia. In addition, it significantly reduced circulating white blood cells, lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils and platelets compared to colon cancer mice. We conclude that ZJ supplementation may delay the progression of colon cancer from hyperplasia to dysplasia and ultimately adenocarcinoma and cancer. In addition, it decreased circulating tumor-related leukocytes, main regulators of cancer inflammation. Dietary consumption of ZJ fruit attenuated the formation of ACF and delayed the progression of colon cancer. 	ziziphus jujuba oleamide
1	A study on artifacts formation in the Thai traditional medicine Prasaplai.The artificial formation of three fatty acid esters, ( E)-4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-en-1-yl linoleate ( 1), ( E)-4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-en-1-yl oleate ( 2) and ( E)-4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-en-1-yl palmitate ( 3) originating during storage by the interaction of components in Prasaplai preparation was investigated. The artifacts were not formed when 0.1 mL of water or more was added to 1.0 g of the mixture (1 : 1) of Zingiber cassumunar and Nigella sativa even when stored for 20 days. This result showed that water was able to stop the esterification reaction. The formation of the artifacts by chemical reaction under water-free conditions was evaluated. ( E)-4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-en-1-ol was mixed with linoleic acid in the presence of anhydrous Na (2)SO (4) and stored in a dessicator for 7 days. The artifact ( 1) was formed in 6.0 % yield. It was concluded that a water-free environment is necessary for the direct chemical formation of the artificial esters.	zingiber cassumunar linoleic acid
3	Protective effect of total flavonoid C-glycosides from Abrus mollis extract on lipopolysaccharide-induced lipotoxicity in mice.Abrus mollis is a widely used traditional Chinese medicine for treating acute and chronic hepatitis, steatosis, and fibrosis. It was found that the total flavonoid C-glycosides from Abrus mollis extract (AME) showed potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and hepatoprotective activities. To further investigate the hepatoprotective effect of AME and its possible mechanisms, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced liver injury models were applied in the current study. The results indicated that AME significantly attenuated LPS-induced lipid accumulation in mouse primary hepatocytes as measured by triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) assays and Oil Red O staining. Meanwhile, AME exerted a protective effect on LPS-induced liver injury as shown by decreased liver index, serum aminotransferase levels, and hepatic lipid accumulation. Real-time PCR and immunoblot data suggested that AME reversed the LPS-mediated lipid metabolism gene expression, such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1). In addition, LPS-induced overexpression of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), X-box-binding protein-1 (XBP-1), and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) were dramatically reversed by AME. Furthermore, AME also decreased the expression of LPS-enhanced interleukin-6 (IL-6) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Here, it is demonstrated for the first time that AME ameliorated LPS-induced hepatic lipid accumulation and that this effect of AME can be attributed to its modulation of hepatic de novo fatty acid synthesis. This study also suggested that the hepatoprotective effect of AME may be related to its down-regulation of unfolded protein response (UPR) activation. 	flavonoid c-glycosides liver injury
3	Acute demyelinating encephalitis after jequirity pea ingestion (Abrus precatorius).INTRODUCTION: Castor and jequirity beans are uncommon causes of poisoning. The more common but less severe castor poisoning is well described, but jequirity bean (Abrus Precatorius) poisoning is rare. The toxicity is attributed to toxalbumins (ricin and abrin) that act by inhibiting protein synthesis. Their use as agents of biological warfare, mechanisms of action, and clinical features of poisoning are summarized. CASE REPORT: A 30-year-old previously healthy female presented with bloody diarrhea and deep coma following ingestion of 3-4 seeds of a plant called 'ratti.' Investigations, including an MRI brain scan, showed evidence of acute demyelinating encephalitis. The patient died three days later due to progressive central nervous system depression. DISCUSSION: This is a previously unreported manifestation of jequirity bean poisoning. Demyelination is immune-mediated, and Abrus is a well-known immuno-modulator and stimulator. A possible immunological pathogenic mechanism is hypothesized.	toxalbumins deep coma

The absolute configuration of the amino acids was determined using Marfey's method on the acid hydrolysates. Compound 1 induced cell death by apoptosis in Jurkat leukemia T cells (IC50 218 nM).	zanthoxylum riedelianum jurkat leukemia t
2	Traditional Japanese medicines inhibit compound action potentials in the frog sciatic nerve.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Traditional Japanese (Kampo) medicines have a variety of clinical effects including pain alleviation, but evidence for a mechanism for their pain relief has not yet been elucidated fully. Considering that Kampo medicine contains many plant-derived chemicals having an ability to inhibit nerve action potential conduction, it is possible that this medicine inhibits nerve conduction. The purpose of the present study was to know how various Kampo medicines affect nerve conduction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined the effects of Kampo and crude medicines on compound action potentials (CAPs) recorded from the frog sciatic nerve by using the air-gap method. RESULTS: Daikenchuto, rikkosan, kikyoto, rikkunshito, shakuyakukanzoto and kakkonto concentration-dependently reduced the peak amplitude of the CAP. Among the Kampo medicines, daikenchuto was the most effective in inhibiting CAPs. Daikenchuto is composed of three kinds of crude medicine, Japanese pepper, processed ginger and ginseng radix. When the crude medicines were tested, Japanese pepper and processed ginger reduced CAP peak amplitudes, while ginseng radix hardly affected CAPs. Moreover, there was an interaction between the Japanese pepper and processed ginger activities in such that one medicine at low but not high concentrations increased the extent of the inhibition by the other one that was co-applied. CONCLUSIONS: Kampo medicines have an ability to inhibit nerve conduction. This action of daikenchuto is due to Japanese pepper and processed ginger but not ginseng radix, probably through an interaction between Japanese pepper and processed ginger in a manner dependent on their concentrations. Nerve conduction inhibition could contribute to at least a part of Kampo medicine's clinical effects such as pain alleviation.	japanese pepper pain
1	Protective Effect of Selected Medicinal Plants against Hydrogen Peroxide Induced Oxidative Damage on Biological Substrates.Oxidative stress is developed due to susceptibility of biological substrates to oxidation by generation of free radicals. In degenerative diseases, oxidative stress level can be reduced by antioxidants which neutralize free radicals. Primary objective of this work was to screen four medicinal plants, namely, Andrographis paniculata, Costus speciosus, Canthium parviflorum, and Abrus precatorius, for their antioxidant property using two biological substrates-RBC and microsomes. The antioxidative ability of three solvent extracts, methanol (100% and 80%) and aqueous leaf extracts, was studied at different concentrations by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances method using Fenton's reagent to induce oxidation in the substrates. The polyphenol and flavonoid content were analyzed to relate with the observed antioxidant effect of the extracts. The phytochemical screening indicated the presence of flavonoids, polyphenols, tannins, and beta-carotene in the samples. In microsomes, 80% methanol extract of Canthium and Costus and, in RBC, 80% methanol extract of Costus showed highest inhibition of oxidation and correlated well with the polyphenol and flavonoid content. From the results it can be concluded that antioxidants from medicinal plants are capable of inhibiting oxidation in biological systems, suggesting scope for their use as nutraceuticals. 	costus speciosus polyphenol
1	Characterization of isobutylhydroxyamides with NGF-potentiating activity from Zanthoxylum bungeanum.Eight isobutylhydroxyamides, including three new (1-3), qinbunamides A-C, and five known sanshools (4-8), ZP-amide A (4), ZP-amide B (5), ZP-amide E (6), ZP-amide C (7), and ZP-amide D (8), were isolated from the pericarps of cultivated Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim, cultivated in Qinling mountain area, Shaanxi, China. The structures of all compounds were determined on the basis of spectroscopic techniques, including 1D and 2D NMR analysis and comparison with previously reported data. Compounds 1 and 2 are the first example of isobutylhydroxyamides containing an ethoxy group, and compound 3 is a rare C11 fatty acid-containing sanshool existing in genus Zanthoxylum. The tested compounds enhanced nerve growth factor (NGF)-mediated neurite outgrowth (neurotrophic activity) in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells, but were inactive in the inhibitory effects on the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical and growth of HCT116 cells at concentrations of 50muM.

0	Angoline: a selective IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway inhibitor isolated from Zanthoxylum nitidum.STAT3 signaling pathway is an important target for human cancer therapy. Thus, the identification of small-molecules that target STAT3 signaling will be of great interests in the development of anticancer agents. The aim of this study was to identify novel inhibitors of STAT3 pathway from the roots of Zanthoxylum nitidum (Roxb.) DC. The bioassay-guided fractionation of MeOH extract of Z. nitidum using a STAT3-responsive gene reporter assay led to the isolation of angoline (1) as a potent and selective inhibitor of the STAT3 signaling pathway (IC50=11.56 muM). Angoline inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation and its target gene expression and consequently induced growth inhibition of human cancer cells with constitutively activated STAT3 (IC50=3.14-4.72 muM). This work provided a novel lead for the development of anti-cancer agents targeting the STAT3 signaling pathway.	Angoline STAT3
1	Aroma constituents and alkylamides of red and green huajiao (Zanthoxylum bungeanum and Zanthoxylum schinifolium).Huajiao denotes the fruits of various species of Zanthoxylum in the plant family Rutaceare used for cooking. The two most commercially popular species are bungeanum (red huajiao) and schinifolium (green huajiao). Fresh huajiao has a very high content of essential oil, up to 11%, which is described as having fresh, spicy, floral, cooling, and green aroma notes. A comprehensive analysis of the essential oils by GC-MS using advanced peak deconvolution and data processing software, revealed many overlapping components. A total of 120 aroma compounds for each species has been found. In the essential oils, linalyl acetate (15%), linalool (13%), and limonene (12%) are the major components of red huajiao, whereas linalool (29%), limonene (14%), and sabinene (13%) are the major components of green huajiao. For estimation of the aroma contribution of individual components, a new concept, "aroma character impact value" (ACI), is introduced as the percentage of the ratio of the concentration of an aroma component to its odor threshold value. Despite the differences in major components, both species have six common compounds of top aroma character impact: linalool, alpha-terpineol, myrcene, 1,8-cineole, limonene, and geraniol. The tingling sensation of huajiao is caused mainly by the alkylamide hydroxy-alpha-sanshool. The tingling compound decomposes easily under hydrolytic conditions or under UV light.

2	Antiasthmatic related properties of Abrus precatorius leaves on various models.OBJECTIVE: Asthma is a multifaceted inflammatory disorder which results into narrowing of airway with broncho-constriction and spasm. As the complex pathophysilogy of asthma, various animal models are generally used to investigate the immunological and physiological pathogenesis of disease. Abrus precatorius Linn (Fabacease) is a climbing shrub. The leaves and roots are sweet in taste and traditionally used for the treatment of asthma, bronchititis, and inflammation. A. precatorius possesses different pharmacological activities. Hence the objective of this study was to evaluate antiasthmatic activity of ethanol extract of A. precatorius leaves using various models. METHODS: In present study ethanol extract of A. precatorius leaves was evaluated for antiasthmatic activity using carrageenan induced paw edema in rats [100-150 mg/kg], histamine induced bronchospasm in guinea pig [200-400 mg/kg] and histamine induced contraction of goat tracheal chain [2.5-25 mug/ml]. RESULTS: Result of study revealed that ethanol extract of A. precatorius significantly exhibited anti-inflammatory effects in rats, oral treatment of extract on guinea pig significantly increases histamine induced preconvulsive dysponea times and the ethanol extract of plant increases got tracheal chain precontracted with histamine. CONCLUSION: Hence present study concludes that ethanol extract of A. precatorius possesses antiasthmatic activity.	a. precatorius asthma, bronchititis
2	Apoptosis inducing activity of benzophenanthridine-type alkaloids and 2-arylbenzofuran neolignans in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells.Thirteen compounds belonging to different classes of alkaloids (1-9) and lignans (10-13), isolated from the methanol extract of roots of the African medicinal plant Zanthoxylum capense, were assayed for their ability as apoptosis inducers in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells. The cytotoxicity of these compounds was evaluated in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells by the MTS assay. Out of the tested compounds, three benzophenanthridine alkaloids (1, 4, and 7), a dibenzyl butyrolactone lignan (10), and two 2-arylbenzofuran neolignans (12 and 13) displayed significant cytotoxicity to HCT116 cells, confirmed by the Guava ViaCount viability assay. The selected compounds (1, 4, 7, 10, 12, and 13) were further tested for apoptosis induction activity in HCT116 cells, by evaluation of nuclear morphology following Hoechst staining, and by caspase-3 like activity assays. Morphologic evaluation of HCT116 nuclei following Hoechst staining and fluorescence microscopy revealed that compounds 1, 4, 7, 10, 12, and 13 induced apoptosis in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells, producing similar, or higher, apoptosis levels when compared with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), the cornerstone cytotoxic used in colon cancer treatment for several decades. In fact, HCT116 cells developed morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis, including chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation and formation of apoptotic bodies. Importantly, compounds 4 and 13 at 20 muM were the most promising in this study, inducing respectively ~11- and 7-fold increases in apoptotic cells as compared to vehicle control, whereas 5-FU increased apoptosis by ~2-fold. Apoptosis induction for compounds 4 and 13 was further confirmed by caspase-3-like activity assays, which showed respectively ~2- and 1.5-fold increases in caspase-3-like activity compared to vehicle control. These results suggested that specific benzophenanthridine alkaloids and 2-arylbenzofuran neolignans isolated from Zanthoxylum capense show strong anticancer activity in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells.	zanthoxylum capense colon carcinoma
1	Phytochemical and biological activities of four wild medicinal plants.The fruits of four wild plants, namely, Capparis decidua, Ficus carica, Syzygium cumini, and Ziziphus jujuba, are separately used as traditional dietary and remedial agents in remote areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. The results of our study on these four plants revealed that the examined fruits were a valuable source of nutraceuticals and exhibited good level of antimicrobial activity. The fruits of these four investigated plants are promising source of polyphenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, and saponins. These four plants' fruits are good sources of iron, zinc, copper, manganese, selenium, and chromium. It was also observed that these fruits are potential source of antioxidant agent and the possible reason could be that these samples had good amount of phytochemicals. Hence, the proper propagation, conservation, and chemical investigation are recommended so that these fruits should be incorporated for the eradication of food and health related problems. 	syzygium cumini flavonoids
1	Effects of selected plant essential oils on the growth and development of mouse preimplantation embryos in vivo.Plant essential oils (EOs) have been reported to have health benefit properties and their preventive and therapeutic use in animals is expected to increase in the future. We evaluated the influence of five essential oils obtained from plant species which are known to have positive antimicrobial, antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects--sage EO from Salvia officinalis L. (Lamiaceae), oregano EO from Origanum vulgare L. (Lamiaceae), thyme EO from Thymus vulgaris L. (Lamiaceae), clove EO from Syzygium aromaticum L. (Myrtaceae) and cinnamon EO from Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume (Lauraceae) on the growth and development of mouse preimplantation embryos in vivo. Essential oils were added to commercial diet at concentrations of 0.25% for sage EO, thyme EO, clove EO, cinnamon EO and 0.1% for oregano EO, and fed to ICR female mice for 2 weeks ad libitum. Females were then mated with males of the same strain. Embryos obtained on Day 4 of pregnancy at the blastocyst stage were stained by morphological triple staining (Hoechst, PI, Calcein-AM) and evaluated using fluorescent microscopy. The effects of essential oils were estimated by the viability of embryos, number of nuclei and distribution of embryos according to nucleus number. Cinnamon EO significantly decreased the number of nuclei and the distribution of embryos according to nucleus number was significantly altered. Sage EO negatively influenced the distribution of embryos according to nucleus number. Clove and oregano EOs induced a significantly increased rate of cell death. Only thyme EO had no detectable effects on embryo development. In conclusion, none of the essential oils had any positive effect on embryo development, but some of them reduced the number of cells and increased the incidence of cell death.	thyme essential oils
1	Evaluation of the natural product antifoulant, zosteric acid, for preventing the attachment of quagga mussels--a preliminary study.The effectiveness of zosteric acid, a natural antifoulant from the marine seagrass Zostera marina, in preventing the attachment of quagga mussels, a biofouling bivalve, was investigated. Animals were exposed to water containing zosteric acid ranging from 0 to 1000 ppm, and their attachment to the container glass walls was tracked with time. 500 ppm zosteric acid was not effective at detaching animals that had already attached, but was able to prevent the attachment of most unattached animals for two days. The anti-fouling effect increased with higher concentration. Low concentrations (250 ppm and below) were not effective at preventing attachment; however, 1000 ppm zosteric acid prevented attachment of mussels for the first three days of zosteric acid exposure, and only 20% of the mussels were attached by day 4. In contrast, animals in control (no zosteric acid) solutions began to attach within one day. In conclusion, zosteric acid is an effective natural product deterrent of attachment of a biofouling bivalve.	zostera marina zosteric acid
1	Feeding deterrents from Zanthoxylum schinifolium against two stored-product insects.Screening for insecticidal principles from several Chinese medicinal herbs showed that the fruit pericarp of Zanthoxylum schinifolium possessed significant feeding deterrence against two stored-product insects (Tribolium castaneum and Sitophilus zeamais). From the methanol extract, two feeding deterrents were isolated by bioassay-guided fractionation. The compounds were identified as schinifoline and skimmianine from their spectroscopic data. Schinifoline has feeding deterrent activity against T. castaneum and S. zeamais adults with EC(50) values of 47.8 and 85.6 ppm respectively. Skimmianine possess feeding deterrent activity against T. castaneum and S. zeamais adults with EC(50) values of 75.7 and 129.7 ppm respectively.	t. castaneum Skimmianine
2	Antitumour effect of abrin on transplanted tumours in mice.Abrin, a galactose specific lectin was purified using sepharose 4B affinity column from seeds of Abrus precatorius. It exhibited antitumour activity in mice when used at a sublethal dose of 7.5 micrograms/kg every alternate day for 10 days. Both intralesional and intraperiloneal (i.p.) administration of abrin was effective in reducing solid tumour mass development induced by Dalton's Lymphoma Ascites (DLA) and Ehrlich's Ascites Carcinoma (EAC) cells. DLA cell line was more sensitive to abrin than EAC. Abrin when injected i.p. increased the life span of ascites tumour bearing mice. Abrin when used simultaneously with tumour cells brought about maximum antitumour effect. On developed tumour masses, abrin administration brought about significant reduction in tumour volume, especially in DLA induced tumours. Prophylactic administration of abrin was found ineffective.	abrus precatorius ascites tumour
1	Metabolism of hibifolin by human intestinal bacteria.Hibifolin, the highest-content bioactive flavonoid of the flowers of Abelmoschus manihot, was incubated with human intestinal bacteria, and four metabolites (1-4) were obtained from the incubated solution by chromatographic methods. The structures of the four metabolites were elucidated as gossypetin 8-O-beta-D-4''-deoxy- Delta(4'')-glucuropyranoside (1), gossypetin (2), quercetin (3), and 8-methoxy-quercetin (4), respectively, on the basis of UV, NMR, and MS data. Metabolite 1 was obtained as a new compound with a specific beta-D-4''-deoxy-Delta(4'')-glucuropyranosyl moiety, which was formed through a unique and novel metabolic pathway that has not been reported previously.	abelmoschus manihot beta-D-4''-deoxy-Delta(4'')-glucuropyranosyl
1	Total saponins extracted from Abrus cantoniensis Hance suppress hepatitis B virus replication in vitro and in rAAV8-1.3HBV transfected mice.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Hepatitis B, an infectious disease caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV), is still a serious problem affecting global public health. Abrus cantoniensis Hance (AC), a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, has been used as a folk medicine for treating hepatitis in China from ancient times. However, its active ingredients are still unclear. AIM OF STUDY: Our previous study indicated that saponins extracted from AC (ACS) were the active anti-HBV ingredients in AC. This study aimed to further investigate the anti-HBV effect of ACS in vitro and in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HepG2.2.15 cells which consecutively produce HBV DNA and HBV antigens were used for in vitro test, and C57BL/6 mice infected by a recombinant adeno-associated virus 8 vector carrying 1.3 copies of HBV genome (rAAV8-HBV1.3) were used for in vivo test. The histopathological changes and the immune indices were evaluated in mice model. Genechip was conducted to identify genes and pathways regulated by ACS in HepG2.2.15 cells. RESULTS: In this study, we confirmed that ACS treatment prominently inhibited production of HBV DNA, Hepatitis Be Antigen (HBeAg), and Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in HepG2.2.15 cells. ACS treatment also decreased serum HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBV DNA level in rAAV8-1.3HBV transfected mice, which is in accordance with the in vitro results. Moreover, HBV infection-induced liver inflammation was significantly relieved by ACS, which could be observed in H&amp;E staining and immunohistochemistry of HBcAg. ACS treatment elevated IFN-gamma level in mice serum and increased CD4+ T cell percentage in splenocytes. KEGG pathway analysis showed that phenylalanine metabolism pathway and tyrosine metabolism pathway were greatly regulated by ACS treatment. CONCLUSION: ACS exerted potent inhibitory effects on HBV replication both in vivo and in vitro, which may provide basis for its potential clinical usage.	AC saponins
2	Sichuan pepper extracts block the PAK1/cyclin D1 pathway and the growth of NF1-deficient cancer xenograft in mice.There is increasing evidence that more than 70% of cancers including pancreatic, breast and prostate cancers as well as neurofibromatosis (NF) are highly addicted to abnormal activation of the Ser/Thr kinase PAK1 for their growth. So far FK228 is the most potent among the HDAC (histone deacetylase) inhibitors that block the activation of both PAK1 and another kinase AKT, downstream of PI-3 kinase. However, FK228 is still in clinical trials (phase 2) for a variety of cancers (but not for NF as yet), and not available for most cancer/NF patients. Thus, we have been exploring an alternative which is already in the market, and therefore immediately useful for the treatment of those desperate cancer/NF patients. Here we provide the first evidence that extracts of Chinese/ Japanese peppercorns (Zanthoxyli Fructus) from the plant Zanthoxylum piperitum called "Hua Jiao"/"Sansho", block selectively the key kinase PAK1, leading to the downregulation of cyclin D1. Unlike FK228, these extracts do not inhibit AKT activation at the concentrations that block either cancer growth or PAK1 activation. The Chinese pepper extract selectively inhibits the growth of NF1-deficient malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) cells, without affecting the growth of normal fibroblasts, and suppresses the growth of NF1-deficient human breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) xenograft in mice. Our data suggest that these peppercorn extracts would be potentially useful for the treatment of PAK1-dependent NF such as MPNST, in addition to a variety of PAK1-dependent cancers including breast cancers.	hua jiao breast cancers
1	Fumigant toxicity of cassia and cinnamon oils and cinnamaldehyde and structurally related compounds to Dermanyssus gallinae (Acari: Dermanyssidae).The toxicity of two cassia oils, four cinnamon oils and (E)-cinnamaldehyde and (E)-cinnamic acid and 34 structurally related compounds to adult Dermanyssus gallinae (De Geer) collected from a poultry house was examined using a vapour-phase mortality bioassay. Results were compared with those of dichlorvos, a conventional acaricide. The cassia and cinnamon oils (cinnamon technical, cinnamon #500, cassia especial, cassia true, cinnamon bark and cinnamon green leaf) exhibited good fumigant toxicity (LD(50), 11.79-26.40 mug cm(-3)). alpha-Methyl-(E)-cinnamaldehyde (LD(50), 0.45 mug cm(-3)) and (E)-cinnamaldehyde (0.54 mug cm(-3)) were the most toxic compounds and the toxicity of these compounds was comparable to that of dichlorvos (0.30 mug cm(-3)). Potent fumigant toxicity was also observed in allyl cinnamate, ethyl-alpha-cyanocinnamate, (E)-2-methoxylcinnamic acid and (Z)-2-methoxylcinnamic acid (LD(50), 0.81-0.92 mug cm(-3)). Structure-activity relationships indicate that structural characteristics, such as types of functional groups and carbon skeleton rather than vapour pressure parameter, appear to play a role in determining toxicity. The essential oils and compounds described merit further study as potential acaricides for the control of D. gallinae populations as fumigants with contact action due to global efforts to reduce the level of highly toxic synthetic acaricides in the agricultural environment.	cinnamon (E)-cinnamaldehyde
2	Traditional herbal remedies used for the treatment of urinary schistosomiasis in Zimbabwe.A total of 286 traditional healers, 85% of them registered with the Zimbabwe National Traditional Healers' Association (ZINATHA), in five administrative provinces of Zimbabwe, were interviewed to assess their knowledge about the signs and symptoms of urinary schistosomiasis. Information on the names of plants used to treat Schistosoma haematobium infections was solicited. Haematuria was mentioned by 99% of the traditional healers to be the most obvious sign of S. haematobium infection. General body weakness, increased urinary frequency and pain on micturition also were reported to be some of the signs of infection. Eight plant materials were identified as the most commonly used for the treatment of S. haematobium. The plants were identified and parts collected to investigate their antischistosomal properties. The plant materials were prepared according to the guidelines of the traditional healers and their efficacy determined by administering the crude extracts orally to hamsters infected with S. haematobium cercariae. The results obtained suggested that plant extracts from Abrus precatorius (Leguminosae), Pterocarpus angolensis (Leguminosae) and Ozoroa insignis (Anacardiaceae) were lethal to adult schistosomes.	abrus precatorius schistosoma haematobium infections
1	Efficient quantification of the phenolic profiles of Zanthoxylum bungeanum leaves and correlation between chromatographic fingerprint and antioxidant activity.Sixteen subsequent fractions were prepared from the ethyl acetate fraction of Zanthoxylum bungeanum leaves after bio-guided chromatographic separation. The HPLC profiles and antioxidant activity of the various fractions indicated that the content of eight phenolic compounds (chlorogenic acid, epicatechin, rutin, hyperoside, trifolin, quercitrin, afzelin and quercetin) and antioxidant activity vary significantly, and high concentrations of a combination of eight phenolic compounds would result in an increase of the antioxidant activity. These results suggested that the eight compounds could be used as chemical markers for quality assessment of Z. bungeanum leaves. Correlation between chromatographic fingerprint and antioxidant activity of the fractions showed that quercitrin and hyperoside play crucial roles in the antioxidant activity, and they can be seen as the milestone for quality control. The findings also suggested that five obtained fractions (E-3-3, E-2-4, E-7, E-5 and E-4) could become useful supplements for functional food ingredients and health-related products. 	z. bungeanum afzelin
2	Cinnamon extract induces tumor cell death through inhibition of NFkappaB and AP1.BACKGROUND: Cinnamomum cassia bark is the outer skin of an evergreen tall tree belonging to the family Lauraceae containing several active components such as essential oils (cinnamic aldehyde and cinnamyl aldehyde), tannin, mucus and carbohydrate. They have various biological functions including anti-oxidant, anti-microbial, anti-inflammation, anti-diabetic and anti-tumor activity. Previously, we have reported that anti-cancer effect of cinnamon extracts is associated with modulation of angiogenesis and effector function of CD8+ T cells. In this study, we further identified that anti-tumor effect of cinnamon extracts is also link with enhanced pro-apoptotic activity by inhibiting the activities NFkappaB and AP1 in mouse melanoma model. METHODS: Water soluble cinnamon extract was obtained and quality of cinnamon extract was evaluated by HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) analysis. In this study, we tested anti-tumor activity and elucidated action mechanism of cinnamon extract using various types of tumor cell lines including lymphoma, melanoma, cervix cancer and colorectal cancer in vitro and in vivo mouse melanoma model. RESULTS: Cinnamon extract strongly inhibited tumor cell proliferation in vitro and induced active cell death of tumor cells by up-regulating pro-apoptotic molecules while inhibiting NFkappaB and AP1 activity and their target genes such as Bcl-2, BcL-xL and survivin. Oral administration of cinnamon extract in melanoma transplantation model significantly inhibited tumor growth with the same mechanism of action observed in vitro. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that anti-tumor effect of cinnamon extracts is directly linked with enhanced pro-apoptotic activity and inhibition of NFkappaB and AP1 activities and their target genes in vitro and in vivo mouse melanoma model. Hence, further elucidation of active components of cinnamon extract could lead to development of potent anti-tumor agent or complementary and alternative medicine for the treatment of diverse cancers.	cinnamomum cassia melanoma
1	Downscaling of Industrial Turbo-Distillation to Laboratory Turbo-Clevenger for Extraction of Essential Oils. Application of Concepts of Green Analytical Chemistry.In the effort of innovation towards green analytical chemistry concepts and considering the six principles of green extraction, the industrial turbodistillation process was downscaled into a laboratory apparatus turbo-Clevenger (TC) for the extraction of essential oils. Turbodistillation is used as an industrial purpose for the extraction of essential oils from hard matrixes such as wood, barks, seeds. In this work, a TC and the conventional technique of hydrodistillation (HD, Clevenger apparatus) are used for the extraction of essential oils from three spices with hard structures (Illicium verum, Schinus terebinthifolius, and Cinnamomum cassia) and are compared. This study shows that the essential oils extracted by TC in 30 min were quantitatively (yield and kinetics profile) and qualitatively (aromatic profile) similar to those obtained using conventional hydrodistillation in 3 h. This process, which gave a reduced extraction time, was perfectly adapted to the extraction of hard matrixes.	cinnamomum cassia essential oils
3	In silico investigation of potential pyruvate kinase M2 regulators from traditional Chinese medicine against cancers.A recent research in cancer research demonstrates that tumor-specific pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) plays an important role in chromosome segregation and mitosis progression of tumor cells. To improve the drug development of TCM compounds, we aim to identify potent TCM compounds as lead compounds of PKM2 regulators. PONDR-Fit protocol was utilized to predict the disordered disposition in the binding domain of PKM2 protein before virtual screening as the disordered structure in the protein may cause the side effect and downregulation of the possibility of ligand to bind with target protein. MD simulation was performed to validate the stability of interactions between PKM2 proteins and each ligand after virtual screening. The top TCM compounds, saussureamine C and precatorine, extracted from Lycium chinense Mill. and Abrus precatorius L., respectively, have higher binding affinities with target protein in docking simulation than control. They have stable H-bonds with residues A:Lys311 and some other residues in both chains of PKM2 protein. Hence, we propose the TCM compounds, saussureamine C and precatorine, as potential candidates as lead compounds for further study in drug development process with the PKM2 protein against cancer. 	saussureamine c cancer
2	The flower extract of Abelmoschus manihot (Linn.) increases cyclin D1 expression and activates cell proliferation.Abelmoschus manihot (Linn.) is a medicinal herbal plant that is commonly used to treat chronic kidney disease and hepatitis. However, its effect on cell proliferation has not been clearly revealed. In this report, we sought to determine the effect of the flower extract of Amelmoschus manihot (FA) on cell proliferation. Based on our findings, FA increased the proliferation of human diploid fibroblast (HDF) and HEK293 cells. Through cell cycle analysis, FA was found to increase the number of HDF cells in the S phase and G2/M phase. FA also increased the expression of cyclin D1 and enhanced the migration of HDF cells. By administering FA to HDF cells with >=30 passages, a decrease in the number of senescence-associated beta galactosidase-positive cells was observed, thereby indicating that FA can ameliorate cellular senescence. Collectively, our findings indicate that FA increases cyclin D1 expression and regulates cell proliferation.	abelmoschus manihot kidney disease
1	Hepatoprotective activity of leaves of Zanthoxylum armatum DC in CCl4 induced hepatotoxicity in rats.Zanthoxylum armatum DC (Rutaceae) is extensively used in indigenous system of medicine as a tonic, carminative, stomachic and anthelmintic. In the present study, the hepatoprotective activity of the leaves ethanolic extract of Z. armatum (EEZA) was evaluated in CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity in rats. The extract at a dose of 500 mg/kg registered a significant decrease in the levels of serum glutamyl oxalacetic acid transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamyl pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase (ALKP), and serum bilurubin (SBLN) and liver inflammation, which was supported by histopathological studies on liver, thus exhibited a significant hepatoprotective activity. The phytochemical screening of defatted ethanolic extract showed the presence of sterols, alkaloids, flavonoids, and reducing sugars.	z. armatum alkaloids
2	Stimulation of murine macrophages by native and heat-denatured lectin from Abrus precatorius.We have evaluated the immunostimulant activity of native agglutinin (NA) and heat-denatured agglutinin (HDA) obtained from Abrus precatorius seed kernels on murine macrophages. Activated macrophages play an important role in nonspecific immunostimulation in turn by activating the other immune cells in the cascade. Significant alterations are observed in the macrophage functions both by native and heat-denatured Abrus agglutinin. Increased production of nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide and a high phagocytic and bactericidal activity is potentiated by both NA and HDA. It is also observed that activated macrophages also released interleukin-1. These results suggest that both NA and HDA act as immunostimulants in vitro.	abrus precatorius immunostimulation
1	Quantitative and pattern recognition analyses of magnoflorine, spinosin, 6'''-feruloyl spinosin and jujuboside A by HPLC in Zizyphi Semen.Two rapid and simple HPLC methods with UV detector to determine three main compounds (magnoflorine, spinosin and 6'''-feruloyl spinosin) and evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD) to determine jujuboside A were developed for the chemical analyses of Zizyphi Semen. Magnoflorine, spinosin, and 6'''-feruloyl spinosin were separated with an YMC J'sphere ODS-H80 column (250 mm x 4.6 mm, 4 mum) by the gradient elution followed by the isocratic elution using methanol with 0.1 % formic acid and water with 0.1 % formic acid as the mobile phase. The flow rate was 1.0 mL/min. Jujuboside A was separated by HPLC-ELSD with YoungJinBioChrom Aegispak C18-L column (250 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 mum) column in a gradient elution using methanol with 0.1 % formic acid (A) and water with 0.1 % formic acid as the mobile phase. These two methods were fully validated with respect to linearity, precision, accuracy, stability, and robustness. These HPLC methods were applied successfully to quantify four compounds in a Zizyphi Semen extract. The HPLC analytical methods were validated for pattern recognition analysis by repeated analysis of 91 seed samples corresponding to 48 Zizyphus jujuba var. spinosa (J01-J48) and 43 Zizyphus mauritiana (M01-M43). The results indicate that these methods are suitable for a quality evaluation of Zizyphi Semen.	zizyphus jujuba var spinosin
4	Cinnamaldehyde Inhibits the Function of Osteosarcoma by Suppressing the Wnt/beta-Catenin and PI3K/Akt Signaling Pathways.Background: Osteosarcoma (OS) is a primary bone tumor associated with locally aggressive growth and early metastatic potential that typically occurs in children and adolescents. Chinese traditional medicine Cinnamomum cassia Presl has been shown to have significant tumor-killing effect, in which cinnamaldehyde (CA) is the main active ingredient. Purpose: To explore the anticancer effect of CA on the osteosarcoma cells and the possible molecular mechanism. Methods: Crystal violet assay, MTT assay and colony-forming assay were used to confirm the inhibitory role of CA in the proliferation of 143B and MG63 osteosarcoma cells. Hoechst 33258 staining and flow cytometry were used to observe apoptosis. The migration and invasion role of OS cells were evaluated using transwell assays and wound healing assays. Western blotting was used to analyse the protein expression levels. Nude mice were inoculated with 143B cells to establish an orthotopic OS tumor animal model and to investigate the effects of CA on OS tumors. Results: According to crystal violet assay, MTT assay and colony-forming assay, CA significantly inhibited cell proliferation. Hoechst 33258 staining and flow cytometry analysis showed that CA-induced apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, transwell assays and wound healing assays showed that CA inhibited the migration and invasion of osteosarcoma cells. In vivo mouse models, CA inhibited the growth of osteosarcoma. The potential mechanisms could be that CA inhibited the transcriptional activity of Wnt/beta-catenin and PI3K/Akt of the osteosarcoma. Conclusion: CA may inhibit the proliferation, migration, invasion and promote apoptosis of OS cells by inhibiting Wnt/beta-catenin and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. CA may be a potentially effective anti-tumor drug.	beta-catenin osteosarcoma
2	Therapeutic potential of root and stem bark of wild medicinal plant Ziziphus mauritiana (Lamk.) against silica induced toxicity in Wistar albino rats.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ziziphus mauritiana (Lamk.) of the family Rhamnaceae is a traditional herbal medicinal plant commonly called as 'ber' (Indian jujube). It is traditionally used as food source and helps in treatment of various diseases like malaria, asthma, diarrhoea, typhoid, diabetes, skin diseases and acts as a pain killer. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to evaluate the ability of extracts of barks of root and stem of Ziziphus mauritiana (ZM) to cure silica induced toxicity in Wistar albino rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experiments carried out on the acute toxicity studies of silica and therapeutic potential of ZM extracts were based on OECD guidelines and from these results lethal dose (LD50) values were determined. Silica was administered by IP injection at 20 mg/kg b.w. for 10 days and roots and stem barks extracts of ZM were fed orally by gavage at 400 mg/kg b.w. for 21 days. Assessments of biochemical, haematological parameters as well as liver histological examination were performed in the study. RESULTS: After 21 days of oral feeding of extracts of root and stem of ZM, it was found to alter the liver histology. Significant decrease in enzymes such as ALT, AST, ALP, LDH and urea, creatinine and uric acid levels in serum were recorded. Treatment with extracts could help enzymatic activity of liver antioxidant enzymes to settle towards normal level and significant decrease in the lipid peroxidation along with increase in the value of GSH in liver, was also observed. In addition, extracts of ZM also helped to reduce the serum NO, IL-6 and TNF-alpha level. CONCLUSION: Results of this study has suggested that the extracts of root and stem bark of ZM can be used for therapeutic purpose to prevent silica induced toxicity. ZM extracts could be utilised as natural antioxidant and immunotherapeutic medicines to protect silica induced cell damage.	jujube pain
4	Potent modulation of P-glycoprotein activity by naturally occurring phenylbutenoids from Zingiber cassumunar.Five phenylbutenoid derivatives from the rhizomes of Zingiber cassumunar Roxb. (Zingiberaceae) were evaluated for their P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitory effects in a P-gp over-expressing multidrug resistant (MDR) human breast cancer cell line, MCF-7/ADR. As a result, a phenylbutenoid dimer, (+/-)-trans-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-[(E)-3,4-dimethoxystyryl]cyclohex-1-ene (1), exhibited highly potent P-gp inhibitory activity, decreasing the IC(50) value of daunomycin (DNM) to 4.31 +/- 0.40 microm in the cells (DNM IC(50) = 37.1 +/- 0.59 microm). The positive control, verapamil decreased the IC(50) value of DNM to 6.94 +/- 0.40 microm. Three phenylbutenoid monomers, 2-4 from this plant, also resulted in a significant decrease in the IC(50) values of DNM compared with the control. In particular, compound 1 markedly enhanced [(3)H]-DNM accumulation and significantly reduced [(3)H]-DNM efflux compared with the control, and this effect was more potent than that of verapamil, a well-known P-gp inhibitor. These results suggest that compound 1 of Z. cassumunar can be developed as a potent chemo-sensitizing agent that reverses P-gp-mediated MDR in human cancer chemotherapy.	P-gp cancer
2	Protective Effect of Bioactivity Guided Fractions of Ziziphus jujuba Mill. Root Bark against Hepatic Injury and Chronic Inflammation via Inhibiting Inflammatory Markers and Oxidative Stress.The tribal communities of North Eastern India rely on herbal medicine to cure various disease conditions. Ziziphus jujuba Mill. (Rhamnaceae) is one of such medicinal plants used for curing liver ailments, insomnia, anemia, diarrhea, diabetic complications, cancer, and loss of appetite. The present study was aimed to describe the protective ability of Z. jujuba root bark (ZJRB) against hepatic injury and chronic inflammation. Bioactivity guided fractionation of Z. jujuba methanol extract (ZJME) was performed using different solvents of increasing polarity viz. hexane (ZJHF), chloroform (ZJCF), ethyl acetate (ZJEAF), water (ZJWF), and residue (ZJMR). In vitro antioxidant results revealed that both ZJME and ZJWF possess strong antioxidant activity among all the fractions and mother extract tested. Further, ZJME and ZJWF showed significant protection against CCl4 intoxicated HepG2 cell lines by means of increased cell viability and decreased LDH levels compared to control group. ZJME at 200, 400 mg/kg and ZJWF at 50, 100 mg/kg inhibited the lipid peroxidation and significantly restored the liver function markers (AST, ALT, ALP, LDH, SOD, and CAT) and cytokine levels (TNF-alpha, Il-1beta, and Il-10) in CCl4 induced acute liver damage in rats. All the results were comparable with standard drug silymarin which was further confirmed by histopathology analysis of liver. Similarly, inflammation and increase inflammatory cytokines levels of carrageenan induced paw edema in rats have been refurbished to normal levels on par with the standard drug indomethacin. ZJWF demonstrated potent response than ZJME in all the biological tests conducted. The results of the study signify the ability of ZJRB as good therapeutic agent for liver toxicity and chronic inflammation. 	z. jujuba liver damage
1	[Oral health care by utilizing food function].We examined the effects of spices and herbs on Candida albicans to develop therapeutic tools against oral diseases such as oral candidiasis. C. albicans, a dimorphic fungus, is a component of the healthy human microbial flora. However, the excessive overgrowth of C. albicans causes oral candidiasis, and the symptoms, accompanied by severe inflammation, reduce the quality of life of elderly people. We found that spices such as clove (Syzygium aromaticum) and cassia (Cinnamomum aromaticum) exhibit inhibitory activity against Candida mycelial growth and show therapeutic efficacy in a murine oral candidiasis model. Our studies also demonstrated that the inhibitory activity of cinnamaldehyde was strengthened in parallel with a prolonged treatment time. Furthermore, when cinnamaldehyde in combination with methylcellulose was administered to the model mice, the therapeutic effect was potentiated. Here, we summarize up-to-date findings on how to use spices and herbs on a daily basis to improve or prevent oral problems such as oral candidiasis with the presentation of our recent data.	c. albicans cinnamaldehyde
1	Cardioprotective effects of silver fir (Abies alba) extract in ischemic-reperfused isolated rat hearts.BACKGROUND: Silver fir trunk extract (SFTE) is a complex mixture of antioxidative polyphenols (lignans and phenolic acids) from the trunks of silver fir trees (Abies alba, lignum). In our previous study, we have shown that SFTE exerts strong antioxidative and protective effects against atherogenic, diet-induced arterial wall damage. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to test the potential protective effects of SFTE and its compounds, two phenolic acids (p-coumaric and protocatechuic acids) in ischemia-reperfusion injury of isolated rat hearts. DESIGN: Isolated hearts of Wistar rats aged 4-8 weeks were exposed to perfusion, ischemia, and reperfusion periods. The experiments were performed using the following five groups: control, SFTE (10 microg/L), SFTE (100 microg/L), protocatechuic acid, and p-coumaric. Aortas were isolated to measure vascular responses in the presence of Nomega-Nitro-L-arginine. RESULTS: SFTE dose-dependently reduced ischemic-reperfusion heart damage, which was indicated as the decrease in the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release rate and arrhythmias duration by 80% and an increase in coronary flow rate during the reperfusion period. Two tested compounds (p-coumaric and protocatechuic acids) acted less cardioprotective, since they decreased the duration of arrhythmias only by 40 and 45%, respectively, and did not decrease LDH release rates during the reperfusion period. Only p-coumaric acid increased coronary flow rates, whereas protocatechuic acid did not. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the SFTE exerted the strongest cardioprotective effect, whereas its constituents (the p-coumaric and protocatechuic acids) were less effective in inducing cardioprotection.	abies alba protocatechuic acids
2	In vitro anti-Helicobacter pylori action of 30 Chinese herbal medicines used to treat ulcer diseases.Infection by Helicobacter pylori has been ascertained to be an important etiologic impetus leading usually to chronic active gastritis and gastric ulcer with growing incidences worldwide. Utilizing as the test pathogen a standard and five clinic strains of Helicobacter pylori, the antibacterial action was assessed in vitro with ethanol extracts of 30 Chinese herbal medicines which have been frequently prescribed since ancient times for treating gastritis-like disorders. Among the 30 tested materials, the ethanol extracts of Abrus cantoniensis (Fabaceae), Saussurea lappa (Asteraceae) and Eugenia caryophyllata (Myrtaceae) were strongly inhibitory to all test strains (MICs: approximately 40 microg/ml), and Hippophae rhamnoides (Elaeagnaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii (Liliaceae), Magnolia officinalis and Schisandra chinensis (Magnoliaceae), Corydalis yanhusuo (Papaveraceae), Citrus reticulata (Rutaceae), Bupleurum chinense and Ligusticum chuanxiong (Apiaceae) substantially active with MICs close to 60.0 microg/ml. As to antibacterial actions of the aqueous extracts of the same drugs, those derived from Cassia obtusifolia (Fabaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii and Eugenia caryophyllata were remarkably inhibitory against all the six Helicobacter pylori strains (MICs: approximately 60 microg/ml). The work compared almost quantitatively the magnitude of the anti-Helicobacter pylori actions of the 30 most prescribed gastritis-treating Chinese herbal drugs, and located as well some source plants where potent anti-Helicobacter pylori phytochemicals could be characterized.	cassia obtusifolia gastritis
1	Detection of Abrin Holotoxin Using Novel Monoclonal Antibodies.Abrin, a member of the ribosome-inactivating protein family, is produced by the Abrus precatorius plant. Having the potential to pose a severe threat to both human and animal health, abrin is classified as a Select Agent by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. However, an immunoassay that is specific for intact abrin holotoxin has not yet been reported. In this study, seven new monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), designated as Abrin-1 through Abrin-7 have been developed. Isotyping analyses indicate these mAbs have IgG1, IgG2a, or IgG2b heavy-chains and kappa light-chains. Western blot analyses identified two abrin A-chain specific mAbs, Abrin-1 and Abrin-2, and four B-chain specific mAbs (Abrin-3, -5, -6, and -7). A sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), capable of detecting a mixture of abrin isoforms and agglutinins was developed using B-chain specific Abrin-3 for capture and A-chain specific Abrin-2 as detector. The ELISA is highly sensitive and detects 1 ng/mL of the abrin holotoxin in phosphate-buffered saline, nonfat milk, and whole milk, significantly below concentrations that would pose a health concern for consumers. This ELISA also detects native abrin in plant extracts with a very low background signal. The new abrin mAbs and ELISA should be useful for detecting this potent toxin in the milk supply chain and other complex matrices.	abrus precatorius holotoxin
1	In Vitro Anti-Leishmanial Activity of Essential Oils Extracted from Vietnamese Plants.Leishmania mexicana is one of the pathogens causing cutaneous leishmaniasis which is associated with patient morbidity. In our researches for new safe and effective treatments, thirty-seven essential oils (EOs) extracted from Vietnamese plants were screened in vitro for the first time on Leishmania mexicana mexicana(Lmm) promastigotes at the maximum concentration of 50 nL/mL. Active EOs were also analyzed for cytotoxicity on mammalian cell lines (WI38, J774) and their selectivity indices (SI) were calculated. Their composition was determined by GC-MS and GC-FID. Our results indicated that EOs extracted from Cinnamomum cassia, Zingiber zerumbet, Elsholtzia ciliata and Amomum aromaticum, possessed a moderate anti-leishmanial activity, with IC50 values of 2.92 +- 0.08, 3.34 +- 0.34, 8.49 +- 0.32 and 9.25 +- 0.64 nL/mL respectively. However, they also showed cytotoxicity with SI &lt; 10. The most promising EO was extracted from Ocimum gratissimum, displaying an IC50 of 4.85 +- 1.65 nL/mL and SI &gt; 10. It contained 86.5% eugenol, which was demonstrated to be effective on Lmm with IC50 of 2.57 +- 0.57 nL/mL and not toxic on mammalian cells, explaining the observed activity.	cinnamomum cassia EOs
2	Zanthoxylum usambarense (Engl.) Kokwaro (Rutaceae) extracts inhibit the growth of the breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, but not the brain tumour cell line U251 in vitro.Zanthoxylum usambarense (Engl.) Kokwaro has traditionally been used for the treatment of malaria, upper respiratory tract infections, cough, rheumatism, tooth decay and sore gums in Kenya and other African countries. Dried ground parts of Z. usambarense were extracted by maceration using methanol (MeOH) at room temperature, extract was dried and reconstituted in 70% aq. MeOH and partitioned against n-hexane and chloroform (CHCl3 ) to obtain MeOH, n-hexane and CHCl3 extracts. All extracts were assessed for cytotoxicity against two breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, and the brain tumour cell line U251 by the MTT assay. The free-radical scavenging activity of the extracts was also determined by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryhydrazyl (DPPH) assay. In the DPPH assay, the MeOH extract was found to be the most active free-radical scavenger with a RC50 value of 41.1 x 10(-3)  mg/mL. It also displayed significant cytotoxicity against the MCF-7 cell line (IC50 42.9 microg/mL) and appeared to have induced cell death through apoptosis. None of the test extracts showed any activity against the U251 cell line at test concentrations. The present findings demonstrated that Z. usambarense could be a potential source for new cytotoxic compounds for possible anticancer drug development.	z. usambarense breast cancer
1	Immunosuppressive Effects of A-Type Procyanidin Oligomers from Cinnamomum tamala.Cinnamon barks extracts have been reported to regulate immune function; however, the component(s) in cinnamon barks responsible for this effect is/are not yet clear. The aim of this study is to find out the possible component(s) that can be used as therapeutic agents for immune-related diseases from cinnamon bark. In this study, the immunosuppressive effects of fraction (named CT-F) and five procyanidin oligomers compounds, cinnamtannin B1, cinnamtannin D1 (CTD-1), parameritannin A1, procyanidin B2, and procyanidin C1, from Cinnamomum tamala or Cinnamomum cassia bark were examined on splenocytes proliferation model induced by ConA or LPS. Then, the effects of activated compound CTD-1 on cytokine production and 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) induced delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response were detected to evaluate the immunosuppressive activity of CTD-1. It was found that CT-F and CTD-1 significantly inhibited the splenocyte proliferation induced by ConA or LPS. CTD-1 dose-dependently reduced the level of IFN-gamma and IL-2 and intensively suppressed DNFB-induced DTH responses. These findings suggest that the immunosuppressive activities of cinnamon bark are in part due to procyanidin oligomers. CTD-1 may be a potential therapeutic agent for immune-related diseases. 	cinnamomum cassia cinnamic aldehyde
1	In vitro activities of plant extracts on human Loa loa isolates and cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells.Loa loa, a filarial worm, can cause fatal encephalitis in humans. In an attempt to find alternatives to the standard treatments (ivermectin and diethylcarbamazine citrate), we tested 12 methanolic extracts of nine traditional plant remedies. The extracts (100-0.09 microg/ml) were incubated with 20 Loa loa microfilariae isolated from patients at 37 degrees C with 5% CO(2) in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal serum and antibiotics. Activity was evaluated 120 h later by counting live microfilariae under a microscope. Cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells was estimated by measuring 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2-5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide transformation to formazan at 450 nM in a spectrophotometer. The plants tested were Lophira alata, Greenwayodendron suaveolens, Uapaca togoensis, Zanthoxylum heitzii, Peperomia pellucida, Piptadeniastrum africanum, Petersianthus macrocarpus, Vernonia conferta, and Vernonia hymenolepis. Chemical screening showed that most of the extracts contained reducing sugars, tannin or polyphenols, sterols or triterpenes, saponosides, and alkaloids. None contained carotinoids and few contained flavonoids. The 50% lethal concentration ranged from 0.22 to 70.28 microg/ml, while the 50% inhibitory concentration for eukaryotic cells (IC(50)) ranged from 8.52 to 119.52 microg/ml. Extracts of P. macrocarpus (selectivity index = 72.16), P. africanum (13.69), Z. heitzii (12.11), and L. alata (9.26) were highly selective for L. loa.	p. macrocarpus tannin

3	Anthelmintic properties of alpha-sanshool from Zanthoxylum liebmannianum.The decoction of the stem bark of Zanthoxylum liebmannianum (Engelm.) P. Wilson (Rutaceae) decreased the count of intestinal nematode eggs in naturally infected sheep. In addition, the chloroformic extract was toxic to Ascaris suum. Fractionation of the organic extract guided by the Ascaris suum lethality test led to the isolation of alpha-sanshool (LC50 = 83.4 x 10(-5)M) as the only active compound. On the other hand, alpha-sanshool induced tonic-clonic seizures when it was injected intraperitoneally to mice. This finding could be a warning regarding the potential toxicity of this plant.	alpha-sanshool tonic-clonic seizures
3	Asperindoles A-D and a p-Terphenyl Derivative from the Ascidian-Derived Fungus Aspergillus sp. KMM 4676.Four new indole-diterpene alkaloids asperindoles A-D (1-4) and the known p-terphenyl derivative 3&amp;Prime;-hydroxyterphenyllin (5) were isolated from the marine-derived strain of the fungus Aspergillus sp., associated with an unidentified colonial ascidian. The structures of 1-5 were established by 2D NMR and HRESIMS data. The absolute configurations of all stereocenters of 1-4 were determined by the combination of ROESY data, coupling constants analysis, and biogenetic considerations. Asperindoles C and D contain a 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid (2-HIBA) residue, rarely found in natural compounds. Asperindole A exhibits cytotoxic activity against hormone therapy-resistant PC-3 and 22Rv1, as well as hormone therapy-sensitive human prostate cancer cells, and induces apoptosis in these cells at low-micromolar concentrations.	asperindoles a prostate cancer
1	High-performance liquid chromatography--two wavelength detection of triterpenoid acids from the fruits of Ziziphus jujuba containing various cultivars in different regions and classification using chemometric analysis.A simple and sensitive HPLC-DAD method has been developed for the first time to simultaneously determine 10 triterpenoid acids (ceanothic acid, alphitolic acid, zizyberanal acid, zizyberanalic acid, epiceanothic acid, ceanothenic acid, betulinic acid, oleanolic acid, ursonic acid and zizyberenalic acid) in the dried fruit of Ziziphus jujuba (called Dazao) which has been widely used as one of the traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs). This HPLC assay was performed on a reversed-phase C(18) column (250 mm x 4.6mm, 5 microm) with the column temperature at 35 degrees C. The mobile phase was composed of A (acetonitrile) and B (0.05% aqueous phosphoric acid, v/v). The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min and the detection wave length was set at 205 nm for reference compounds 1-9 and 238 nm for reference compound 10. All calibration curves showed good linear regression (r(2)&gt;0.9999) within the test range. The established method showed good precision and accuracy with overall intra-day and inter-day variations of 0.43-1.72% and 0.53-2.45%, respectively, and overall recoveries of 94.98-104.09% for the 10 compounds analyzed. The validated method was successfully applied for the simultaneous determination of the 10 triterpenoid acids in 42 batches of Dazao which contained 36 cultivars from 22 cultivation regions, and were investigated and authenticated as Z. jujuba. Hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) and principal components analysis (PCA) were performed to differentiate and classify the samples based on the contents of the 10 triterpenoid acids. The presented HPLC-DAD method conjugated with chemometrics approach was demonstrated to be very helpful in using Dazao resources, and was possibly useful in chemotaxonomic characterization.	z. jujuba alphitolic acid
2	Abrus agglutinin suppresses human hepatocellular carcinoma in vitro and in vivo by inducing caspase-mediated cell death.AIM: Abrus agglutinin (AGG) from the seeds of Indian medicinal plant Abrus precatorius belongs to the class II ribosome inactivating protein family. In this study we investigated the anticancer effects of AGG against human hepatocellular carcinoma in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: Cell proliferation, DNA fragmentation, Annexin V binding, immunocytofluorescence, Western blotting, caspase activity assays and luciferase assays were performed to evaluate AGG in human liver cancer cells HepG2. Immunohistochemical staining and TUNEL expression were studied in tumor samples of HepG2-xenografted nude mice. RESULTS: AGG induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. AGG-treated HepG2 cells demonstrated an increase in caspase 3/7, 8 and 9 activities and a sharp decrease in the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, indicating activation of a caspase cascade. Co-treatment of HepG2 cells with AGG and a caspase inhibitor or treatment of AGG in Bax knockout HepG2 cells decreased the caspase 3/7 activity in comparison to HepG2 cells exposed only to AGG. Moreover, AGG decreased the expression of Hsp90 and suppressed Akt phosphorylation and NF-kappaB expression in HepG2 cells. Finally, AGG treatment significantly reduced tumor growth in nude mice bearing HepG2 xenografts, increased TUNEL expression and decreased CD-31 and Ki-67 expression compared to levels observed in the untreated control mice bearing HepG2 cells. CONCLUSION: AGG inhibits the growth and progression of HepG2 cells by inducing caspase-mediated cell death. The agglutinin could be an alternative natural remedy for the treatment of human hepatocellular carcinomas.	abrus precatorius hepatocellular carcinomas
1	Analysis of volatile components, fatty acids, and phytosterols of Abies koreana growing in Poland.Extracts and essential oils from seeds as well as essential oils from cone scales and needles with twigs of the Abies koreana population were studied. An analysis of Korean fir essential oils allowed us to determine 147 volatile compounds. The identified compounds constituted 97-99% of the seed, cone and needle oils. The main volatile in the seed and needle oils was limonene (56.6% and 23.4%, respectively), while the predominant volatile in cone oils was alpha-pinene (51.2%). Korean fir seeds provided a rich source of both essential oil (3.8-8.5%) and extract, which was isolated with a 24.5% yield and contained numerous groups of fatty acids and phytosterols (414 microg/100g extract). The most prominent fatty acids were unsaturated, among which linoleic (41.2%) and oleic (31.2%) fatty acid were the main ones while the dominant sterols were isomers of ergostadienol and beta-sitosterol. A. koreana seeds, cones and needles are a source of many volatile bioactive compounds while the seed extract, with a pleasant scent, contained not only volatiles, but also fractions rich in fatty acids and phytosterols. These facts make A. koreana essential oils and especially the seed extract potential components of cosmetics.	a. koreana fatty acids
1	Fumigant toxicity of cassia and cinnamon oils and cinnamaldehyde and structurally related compounds to Dermanyssus gallinae (Acari: Dermanyssidae).The toxicity of two cassia oils, four cinnamon oils and (E)-cinnamaldehyde and (E)-cinnamic acid and 34 structurally related compounds to adult Dermanyssus gallinae (De Geer) collected from a poultry house was examined using a vapour-phase mortality bioassay. Results were compared with those of dichlorvos, a conventional acaricide. The cassia and cinnamon oils (cinnamon technical, cinnamon #500, cassia especial, cassia true, cinnamon bark and cinnamon green leaf) exhibited good fumigant toxicity (LD(50), 11.79-26.40 mug cm(-3)). alpha-Methyl-(E)-cinnamaldehyde (LD(50), 0.45 mug cm(-3)) and (E)-cinnamaldehyde (0.54 mug cm(-3)) were the most toxic compounds and the toxicity of these compounds was comparable to that of dichlorvos (0.30 mug cm(-3)). Potent fumigant toxicity was also observed in allyl cinnamate, ethyl-alpha-cyanocinnamate, (E)-2-methoxylcinnamic acid and (Z)-2-methoxylcinnamic acid (LD(50), 0.81-0.92 mug cm(-3)). Structure-activity relationships indicate that structural characteristics, such as types of functional groups and carbon skeleton rather than vapour pressure parameter, appear to play a role in determining toxicity. The essential oils and compounds described merit further study as potential acaricides for the control of D. gallinae populations as fumigants with contact action due to global efforts to reduce the level of highly toxic synthetic acaricides in the agricultural environment.	cinnamon allyl cinnamate
1	A potential low-coumarin cinnamon substitute: Cinnamomum osmophloeum leaves.The essential oils from leaves of Taiwan's indigenous cinnamon (Cinnamomum osmophloeum ct. cinnamaldehyde) have similar constituents as compared to that from commercial bark cinnamons. This indigenous cinnamon has been proven to have excellent bioactivities. To understand whether this indigenous cinnamon contains a high level of the hepatotoxic compound, coumarin, as often seen in Cassia cinnamons, current research focused on determining the coumarin content in this indigenous cinnamon and screening the low-coumarin clones. The results demonstrated that the coumarin contents in all tested indigenous cinnamon clones were much lower than that found in Cassia cinnamons. In addition, this indigenous cinnamon contains about 80% (w/w) of cinnamaldehyde and 0.4-2.7% (w/w) of eugenol in its leaf essential oils. This combination could provide this indigenous cinnamon a better shelf life compared to that of regular commercial cinnamons. These results suggested that leaves of this indigenous cinnamon could be a potential resource for a safer cinnamon substitute. 	cinnamon eugenol
2	Water extract of Cinnamomum cassia suppresses angiogenesis through inhibition of VEGF receptor 2 phosphorylation.Angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation, has been a major target for cancer therapy. Antiangiogenic herbal medicines are useful in the treatment of cancer. In this study, we found that a water extract of Cinnamomum cassia (CCWE) was a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis. In cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells, CCWE suppressed vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced proliferation, migration, invasion, tube formation, and intracellular signaling events such as phosphorylation of ERK, p38 and VEGFR2, and activation of matrix metalloproteinase. Furthermore, CCWE inhibited VEGF-induced vessel sprouting of rat aorta ex vivo. These findings might be of particular interest for drug development because VEGF signaling is a potential target for treatment of angiogenesis-associated diseases. 	cinnamomum cassia cancer
2	Glycoprotein of Zanthoxylum piperitum DC has a hepatoprotective effect via anti-oxidative character in vivo and in vitro.This study was carried out to investigate the anti-oxidative and hepatoprotective effects of glycoprotein isolated from Zanthoxylum piperitum DC fruit (ZPDC glycoprotein). ZPDC glycoprotein showed a single band with molecular weight of 24kDa on the 18% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel and consists of a carbohydrate component (18%) and a protein component (82%). We found that ZPDC glycoprotein has a strong scavenging activity against DPPH, superoxide anion, and hydroxyl radicals without any pro-oxidant activity in the cell-free system. In hepatocyte cell lines (Chang liver and BNL CL.2 cells), the results showed that ZPDC glycoprotein has an inhibitory effect on hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase- or glucose/glucose oxidase-induced cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, administration of ZPDC glycoprotein (20mg/kg) lowers the levels of lactate dehydrogenase, alanine transaminase, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, whereas increases that of nitric oxide, accompanying the normalizing effects on the activity of hepatic anti-oxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase) in mouse model of carbon tetrachloride-stimulated acute liver injury. On the whole the results suggest that ZPDC glycoprotein can be a potent hepatoprotective agent as a natural anti-oxidant.	zanthoxylum piperitum liver injury
1	Phenolic content and antioxidant property of the bark extracts of Ziziphus mucronata Willd. subsp. mucronata Willd.BACKGROUND: Several plants traditionally used in treatment of a variety of infections in South Africa are reported in ethnobotanical surveys. Many of these plants including Ziziphus mucronata subsp. mucronata lack scientific reports to support their medicinal importance. METHODS: The antioxidant activities and phenolic contents of the acetone, ethanol and aqueous extracts of the stems of Z. mucronata subsp. mucronata were evaluated using in vitro standard methods. The total phenol, total flavonoids and proanthocyanidin content were determined spectrophotometrically. Quercetin, Tannic acid and catechin equivalents were used for these parameters. The antioxidant activities of the stem bark extracts of this plant were determined by ABTS, DPPH, and ferrous reducing antioxidant property (FRAP) methods. RESULTS: The quantity of the phenolic compounds, flavonoids and proanthocyanidins detected differ significantly in the various extracts. The phenolics were significantly higher than the flavonoids and proanthocyanidin contents in all the extracts investigated. The ferric reducing ability and the radical scavenging activities of the extracts were very high and dose-dependent. The ethanol extract had the highest antioxidant activity, followed by the acetone extract while the aqueous extract was the least active. Reacting with ABTS, the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were (0.0429 +- 0.04 mg/ml) for aqueous, (0.0317 +- 0.04 mg/ml) for acetone and (0.0306 +- 0.04 mg/ml) for ethanol extracts while they inhibited DPPH radical with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 0.0646 +- 0.02 mg/ml (aqueous), 0.0482 +- 0.02 mg/ml (acetone) and 0.0422 +- 0.03 mg/ml (ethanol). CONCLUSIONS: A correlation between the antioxidant activity and the total phenolic contents of the extracts indicated that phenolic compounds were the dominant contributors to the antioxidant activity of the plant. This study, therefore, demonstrated that Z. mucronata subsp. mucronata has strong antioxidant property and free radical scavenging capability.	z. mucronata subsp phenol
4	Cinnamaldehyde Inhibits the Function of Osteosarcoma by Suppressing the Wnt/beta-Catenin and PI3K/Akt Signaling Pathways.Background: Osteosarcoma (OS) is a primary bone tumor associated with locally aggressive growth and early metastatic potential that typically occurs in children and adolescents. Chinese traditional medicine Cinnamomum cassia Presl has been shown to have significant tumor-killing effect, in which cinnamaldehyde (CA) is the main active ingredient. Purpose: To explore the anticancer effect of CA on the osteosarcoma cells and the possible molecular mechanism. Methods: Crystal violet assay, MTT assay and colony-forming assay were used to confirm the inhibitory role of CA in the proliferation of 143B and MG63 osteosarcoma cells. Hoechst 33258 staining and flow cytometry were used to observe apoptosis. The migration and invasion role of OS cells were evaluated using transwell assays and wound healing assays. Western blotting was used to analyse the protein expression levels. Nude mice were inoculated with 143B cells to establish an orthotopic OS tumor animal model and to investigate the effects of CA on OS tumors. Results: According to crystal violet assay, MTT assay and colony-forming assay, CA significantly inhibited cell proliferation. Hoechst 33258 staining and flow cytometry analysis showed that CA-induced apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, transwell assays and wound healing assays showed that CA inhibited the migration and invasion of osteosarcoma cells. In vivo mouse models, CA inhibited the growth of osteosarcoma. The potential mechanisms could be that CA inhibited the transcriptional activity of Wnt/beta-catenin and PI3K/Akt of the osteosarcoma. Conclusion: CA may inhibit the proliferation, migration, invasion and promote apoptosis of OS cells by inhibiting Wnt/beta-catenin and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. CA may be a potentially effective anti-tumor drug.	Akt osteosarcoma
2	The effect of medicinal plants of Islamabad and Murree region of Pakistan on insulin secretion from INS-1 cells.In vitro testing of the extracts of medicinal plants collected from Islamabad and the Murree region on insulin secretagogue activity was carried out. Dried ethanol extracts of all plants (ZH1-ZH19) were dissolved in ethanol and DMSO, and tested at various concentrations (between 1 and 40 microg/mL) for insulin release from INS-1 cells in the presence of 5.5 mM glucose. Glibenclamide was used as a control. Promising insulin secretagogue activity in various plant extracts at 1, 10, 20 and 40 microg/mL was found, while in some cases a decrease in insulin secretion was also observed. Artemisia roxburghiana, Salvia coccinia and Monstera deliciosa showed insulin secretagogue activity at 1 microg/mL (p &lt; 0.05) while Abies pindrow, Centaurea iberica and Euphorbia helioscopia were active at 10 microg/mL (p &lt; 0.05). Extracts of Bauhinia variegata and Bergenia himalacia showed effects at 20 microg/mL (p &lt; 0.05), and Taraxacum officinale and Viburnum foetens at 40 microg/mL (p &lt; 0.05). Insulin secretagogue activity could not be detected in the extracts of Adhatoda vasica, Cassia fistula, Chrysanthemum leucanthemum, Morus alba, Plectranthus rugosus, Peganum harmala and Olea ferruginea. The results suggest that medicinal plants of Islamabad and the Murree region of Pakistan may be potential natural resources for antidiabetic compounds.	artemisia roxburghiana insulin secretion
1	Interaction of a novel Tn (GalNAc alpha 1--&gt;Ser/Thr) glycoprotein with Gal, GalNAc and GlcNAc specific lectins.A naturally occurring Tn glycoprotein (Native ASG-Tn) with GalNAc alpha 1--&gt;Ser/Thr as the only carbohydrate side chains, has been prepared from armadillo submandibular glands. In a quantitative precipitin assay, this glycoprotein completely precipitated Maclura pomifera (MPA), Vicia villosa B4 (VVL-B4) and Artocarpus integrifolia (Jacalin, AIL). It also reacted well with Helix pomatia (HPL) and Wistaria floribunda (WFL) and precipitated over 75% of the lectin nitrogen added, but poorly with Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA1), ricin, peanut (Arachis hypogaea, PNA), Abrus precatorius agglutinin (APA) and Triticum vulgaris (WGA). This finding suggests that this novel Tn-glycoprotein may serve as a useful reagent for differentiating Tn and T specific monoclonal antibodies and lectins.	abrus precatorius Gal
3	Total saponins extracted from Abrus cantoniensis Hance suppress hepatitis B virus replication in vitro and in rAAV8-1.3HBV transfected mice.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Hepatitis B, an infectious disease caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV), is still a serious problem affecting global public health. Abrus cantoniensis Hance (AC), a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, has been used as a folk medicine for treating hepatitis in China from ancient times. However, its active ingredients are still unclear. AIM OF STUDY: Our previous study indicated that saponins extracted from AC (ACS) were the active anti-HBV ingredients in AC. This study aimed to further investigate the anti-HBV effect of ACS in vitro and in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HepG2.2.15 cells which consecutively produce HBV DNA and HBV antigens were used for in vitro test, and C57BL/6 mice infected by a recombinant adeno-associated virus 8 vector carrying 1.3 copies of HBV genome (rAAV8-HBV1.3) were used for in vivo test. The histopathological changes and the immune indices were evaluated in mice model. Genechip was conducted to identify genes and pathways regulated by ACS in HepG2.2.15 cells. RESULTS: In this study, we confirmed that ACS treatment prominently inhibited production of HBV DNA, Hepatitis Be Antigen (HBeAg), and Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in HepG2.2.15 cells. ACS treatment also decreased serum HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBV DNA level in rAAV8-1.3HBV transfected mice, which is in accordance with the in vitro results. Moreover, HBV infection-induced liver inflammation was significantly relieved by ACS, which could be observed in H&amp;E staining and immunohistochemistry of HBcAg. ACS treatment elevated IFN-gamma level in mice serum and increased CD4+ T cell percentage in splenocytes. KEGG pathway analysis showed that phenylalanine metabolism pathway and tyrosine metabolism pathway were greatly regulated by ACS treatment. CONCLUSION: ACS exerted potent inhibitory effects on HBV replication both in vivo and in vitro, which may provide basis for its potential clinical usage.	saponins hepatitis b
1	Linalool Affects the Antimicrobial Efficacy of Essential Oils.The high concentrations of essential oils are generally required to receive microbial purity of the products (cosmetics, medicine). On the other hand, their application due to the high concentration of essential oils may be limited by changes in organoleptic and textural quality of the products, as well as they cause irritation and allergies in users. Addition of linalool to essential oil may significantly enhance its antimicrobial effectiveness and reduce their concentrations in products, taking advantage of their synergistic and additive effects. The aim of the study was to compare antimicrobial activity of essential oil alone and in combination with linalool. The antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Thymus vulgaris, Juniperus communis, Pelargonium graveolens, Citrus bergamia, Citrus grandis, Lavandula angustifolia, Cinnamomum zeylanicum, Melaleuca alternifolia, Syzygium aromaticum, linalool and their combination was investigated against bacteria and fungi using the disc diffusion method. The addition of linalool to S. aromaticum oil in a synergistic manner enhanced its antimicrobial efficacy against P. aeruginosa and A. brasiliensis. Moreover, the additive interaction between this oil and linalool was observed against S. aureus, E. coli and C. albicans. It was also found that linalool in an additive manner increased the antimicrobial effectiveness of T. vulgaris oil against P. aeruginosa. The antimicrobial properties of mixture of essential oils with their active constituents may be used for creating new strategies to maintain microbiological purity of products. 	juniperus communis linalool
2	Some southern African plant species used to treat helminth infections in ethnoveterinary medicine have excellent antifungal activities.BACKGROUND: Diseases caused by microorganisms and parasites remain a major challenge globally and particularly in sub-Saharan Africa to man and livestock. Resistance to available antimicrobials and the high cost or unavailability of antimicrobials complicates matters. Many rural people use plants to treat these infections. Because some anthelmintics e.g. benzimidazoles also have good antifungal activity we examined the antifungal activity of extracts of 13 plant species used in southern Africa to treat gastrointestinal helminth infections in livestock and in man. METHODS: Antifungal activity of acetone leaf extracts was determined by serial microdilution with tetrazolium violet as growth indicator against Aspergillus fumigatus, Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans. These pathogens play an important role in opportunistic infections of immune compromised patients. Cytotoxicity was determined by MTT cellular assay. Therapeutic indices were calculated and selectivity for different pathogens determined. We proposed a method to calculate the relation between microbicidal and microbistatic activities. Total activities for different plant species were calculated. RESULTS: On the whole, all 13 extracts had good antifungal activities with MIC values as low as 0.02 mg/mL for extracts of Clausena anisata against Aspergillus fumigatus and 0.04 mg/mL for extracts of Zanthoxylum capense, Clerodendrum glabrum, and Milletia grandis, against A. fumigatus. Clausena anisata extracts had the lowest cytotoxicity (LC50) of 0.17 mg/mL, a reasonable therapeutic index (2.65) against A. fumigatus. It also had selective activity against A. fumigatus, an overall fungicidal activity of 98% and a total activity of 3395 mL/g against A. fumigatus. This means that 1 g of acetone leaf extract can be diluted to 3.4 litres and it would still inhibit the growth. Clerodendrum glabrum, Zanthoxylum capense and Milletia grandis extracts also yielded promising results. CONCLUSIONS: Some plant extracts used for treatment of parasitic infections also have good antifungal activity. Because it is much easier to isolate antifungal compounds by bioassay guided fractionation, this approach may facilitate the isolation of anthelmintic compounds from active plant extracts. The viability of this approach can be tested by isolating the antifungal compounds and then determining its anthelmintic activity. Some of these plant extracts may also be useful in combating fungal infections.	zanthoxylum capense fungal infections
3	In Vitro Anti-Leishmanial Activity of Essential Oils Extracted from Vietnamese Plants.Leishmania mexicana is one of the pathogens causing cutaneous leishmaniasis which is associated with patient morbidity. In our researches for new safe and effective treatments, thirty-seven essential oils (EOs) extracted from Vietnamese plants were screened in vitro for the first time on Leishmania mexicana mexicana(Lmm) promastigotes at the maximum concentration of 50 nL/mL. Active EOs were also analyzed for cytotoxicity on mammalian cell lines (WI38, J774) and their selectivity indices (SI) were calculated. Their composition was determined by GC-MS and GC-FID. Our results indicated that EOs extracted from Cinnamomum cassia, Zingiber zerumbet, Elsholtzia ciliata and Amomum aromaticum, possessed a moderate anti-leishmanial activity, with IC50 values of 2.92 +- 0.08, 3.34 +- 0.34, 8.49 +- 0.32 and 9.25 +- 0.64 nL/mL respectively. However, they also showed cytotoxicity with SI &lt; 10. The most promising EO was extracted from Ocimum gratissimum, displaying an IC50 of 4.85 +- 1.65 nL/mL and SI &gt; 10. It contained 86.5% eugenol, which was demonstrated to be effective on Lmm with IC50 of 2.57 +- 0.57 nL/mL and not toxic on mammalian cells, explaining the observed activity.

3	Treatment of chronic kidney disease using a traditional Chinese medicine, Flos Abelmoschus manihot (Linnaeus) Medicus (Malvaceae).The flowers of Abelmoschus manihot (Linnaeus) Medicus (Malvaceae; Flos A. manihot) have been used in China for many centuries as a traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of chronic kidney disease. The Huangkui capsule is a single-plant drug extracted from the dry corolla of Flos A. manihot that has been approved by China's State Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of chronic glomerulonephritis. The purpose of this paper is to review briefly some of the past experiences in rapid filtration and to present more fully a few facts brought out in recent studies. The primary chemical constituents of Flos A. manihot are flavonoids. In vivo, the flavonoids can be transformed into glucuronide-sulphate conjugates, which are the major metabolites of Flos A. manihot and could contribute to the renoprotective effects in vivo. Flos A. manihot can ameliorate proteinuria, podocyte apoptosis, glomerulosclerosis and mesangial proliferation. The renoprotective effects of Flos A. manihot are related to inhibition of caspase-3 and caspase-8 overexpression, reduction of the infiltration of ED1(+) and ED3(+) macrophages, downregulation of oxidative stress, inhibition of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and serine/threonine kinase pathways and suppression of transforming growth factor-beta1 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha expression. Recently, a multicentre randomized controlled trial demonstrated that Flos A. manihot was more effective than the angiotensin-receptor blocker losartan in reducing proteinuria in patients with primary glomerular disease. Because Flos A. manihot is generally preferred by Chinese patients and clinicians, high-quality trials to test the efficacy and safety of Flos A. manihot are urgently needed.	flavonoids chronic kidney disease
1	Protective Effect of Selected Medicinal Plants against Hydrogen Peroxide Induced Oxidative Damage on Biological Substrates.Oxidative stress is developed due to susceptibility of biological substrates to oxidation by generation of free radicals. In degenerative diseases, oxidative stress level can be reduced by antioxidants which neutralize free radicals. Primary objective of this work was to screen four medicinal plants, namely, Andrographis paniculata, Costus speciosus, Canthium parviflorum, and Abrus precatorius, for their antioxidant property using two biological substrates-RBC and microsomes. The antioxidative ability of three solvent extracts, methanol (100% and 80%) and aqueous leaf extracts, was studied at different concentrations by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances method using Fenton's reagent to induce oxidation in the substrates. The polyphenol and flavonoid content were analyzed to relate with the observed antioxidant effect of the extracts. The phytochemical screening indicated the presence of flavonoids, polyphenols, tannins, and beta-carotene in the samples. In microsomes, 80% methanol extract of Canthium and Costus and, in RBC, 80% methanol extract of Costus showed highest inhibition of oxidation and correlated well with the polyphenol and flavonoid content. From the results it can be concluded that antioxidants from medicinal plants are capable of inhibiting oxidation in biological systems, suggesting scope for their use as nutraceuticals. 	abrus precatorius tannins
1	Downscaling of Industrial Turbo-Distillation to Laboratory Turbo-Clevenger for Extraction of Essential Oils. Application of Concepts of Green Analytical Chemistry.In the effort of innovation towards green analytical chemistry concepts and considering the six principles of green extraction, the industrial turbodistillation process was downscaled into a laboratory apparatus turbo-Clevenger (TC) for the extraction of essential oils. Turbodistillation is used as an industrial purpose for the extraction of essential oils from hard matrixes such as wood, barks, seeds. In this work, a TC and the conventional technique of hydrodistillation (HD, Clevenger apparatus) are used for the extraction of essential oils from three spices with hard structures (Illicium verum, Schinus terebinthifolius, and Cinnamomum cassia) and are compared. This study shows that the essential oils extracted by TC in 30 min were quantitatively (yield and kinetics profile) and qualitatively (aromatic profile) similar to those obtained using conventional hydrodistillation in 3 h. This process, which gave a reduced extraction time, was perfectly adapted to the extraction of hard matrixes.	schinus terebinthifolius essential oils
2	In vitro anti-Helicobacter pylori action of 30 Chinese herbal medicines used to treat ulcer diseases.Infection by Helicobacter pylori has been ascertained to be an important etiologic impetus leading usually to chronic active gastritis and gastric ulcer with growing incidences worldwide. Utilizing as the test pathogen a standard and five clinic strains of Helicobacter pylori, the antibacterial action was assessed in vitro with ethanol extracts of 30 Chinese herbal medicines which have been frequently prescribed since ancient times for treating gastritis-like disorders. Among the 30 tested materials, the ethanol extracts of Abrus cantoniensis (Fabaceae), Saussurea lappa (Asteraceae) and Eugenia caryophyllata (Myrtaceae) were strongly inhibitory to all test strains (MICs: approximately 40 microg/ml), and Hippophae rhamnoides (Elaeagnaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii (Liliaceae), Magnolia officinalis and Schisandra chinensis (Magnoliaceae), Corydalis yanhusuo (Papaveraceae), Citrus reticulata (Rutaceae), Bupleurum chinense and Ligusticum chuanxiong (Apiaceae) substantially active with MICs close to 60.0 microg/ml. As to antibacterial actions of the aqueous extracts of the same drugs, those derived from Cassia obtusifolia (Fabaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii and Eugenia caryophyllata were remarkably inhibitory against all the six Helicobacter pylori strains (MICs: approximately 60 microg/ml). The work compared almost quantitatively the magnitude of the anti-Helicobacter pylori actions of the 30 most prescribed gastritis-treating Chinese herbal drugs, and located as well some source plants where potent anti-Helicobacter pylori phytochemicals could be characterized.	corydalis yanhusuo gastric ulcer
1	Foliar and cortex oleoresin variability of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) in Albania.Terpene composition of needle and cortical oleoresin from lateral shoots were analyzed by GC/MS for four Silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) populations scattered in natural species range in Albania. More than sixty compounds were detected in the needle oleoresin, which was characterized by a high content of alpha-pinene, camphene, beta-pinene, limonene and bornyl acetate. Three monoterpenes, alpha-pinene, beta-pinene and limonene, and two sesquiterpenes, beta-caryophyllene and germacrene D, comprised the majority of cortical oleoresin. The terpene composition differences among the populations that led to the recognition of two chemotypes. The needle oleoresin from the provinces of Puka, Bulqiza and Llogara were characterised by high amounts of beta-pinene, camphene and alpha-pinene and low amounts of limonene, while that from Drenova had high amounts of beta-pinene and limonene. A similar pattern was found in the cortical oleoresin with the exception of camphene that was a minor contributor. Geographical and seasonal variation between the populations was, also, investigated. Multivariate analysis of both needle and cortical oleoresin separated Drenova (southeastern population) from the other sites. When both major monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes were considered four chemical profiles could be attributed. Based on their chemical profiles, the populations can be divided into two groups: Populations with high content of beta-pinene and alpha-pinene but a low content of limonene (Puka, Bulqiza and Llogara), typical of most of A. alba populations in all its distribution range. Population with a high content of limonene and a moderate content of beta-pinene and alpha-pinene (Drenova).	a. alba limonene
1	Phytochemical analyses of Ziziphus jujuba Mill. var. spinosa seed by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.Ziziphus jujuba Mill. var. spinosa (Z. jujuba) seeds have attracted much attention within the field of medicine due to their significant effects against disturbances of the central nervous system. Secondary metabolites composition is key to the influence of the pharmaceutical and commercial qualities of this plant. In this work, the phytochemical profile of Z. jujuba seeds was analysed by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The UPLC-MS/MS information identified the main secondary metabolites in Z. jujuba seeds, including flavonoid C-glycosides, triterpene acids and unsaturated fatty acids. The leading chemical identified by UPLC-MS/MS was betulinic acid, and oleic acid was the leading volatile from the GC-MS results. All the samples tested showed similar phytochemical profiles, but levels of the chemical compounds varied. Principal component analysis revealed the principal secondary metabolites that could define the differences in quality. It was confirmed that the combination of UPLC-MS/MS and GC-MS was an effective technique to demonstrate the pharmaceutical quality of Z. jujuba seeds. 	z. jujuba unsaturated fatty acids
2	Modification of native fucoidan from Fucus evanescens by recombinant fucoidanase from marine bacteria Formosa algae.Enzymatic depolymerization of fucoidans attracts many researchers due to the opportunity of obtaining standardized fucoidan fragments. Fucoidanase catalyzes the cleavage of fucoidan from Fucus evanescens (FeF) to form low molecular weight products (LMP) and a polymeric fraction (HMP) with 50.8 kDa molecular weight and more than 50% yield. NMR spectroscopy shows that the HMP fraction has regular structure and consists of a repeating fragment [ 3)-alpha-l-Fucp2,4OSO3--(1   4)-alpha-l-Fucp2,4OSO3--(1   4)-alpha-l-Fucp2OSO3--(1 ]n. The anticancer effects of FeF fucoidan and its derivative (HMP) were studied in vitro on colon cancer cells HCT-116, HT-29, and DLD-1. The anticancer activity of the HMP fraction was found to be slightly lower than that of the FeF fucoidan. Research and practical applications of the enzyme include modification of native fucoidans for purposes of regular and easier characterized derivatives acquisition.	fucus evanescens colon cancer
3	Corilagin suppresses RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and inhibits oestrogen deficiency-induced bone loss via the NF-kappaB and PI3K/AKT signalling pathways.Over-activated osteoclastogenesis, which is initiated by inflammation, has been implicated in osteoporosis. Corilagin, a natural compound extracted from various medicinal herbaceous plants, such as Cinnamomum cassia, has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. We found that Corilagin suppressed osteoclast differentiation in a dose-dependent manner, significantly decreased osteoclast-related gene expression and impaired bone resorption by osteoclasts. Moreover, phosphorylation of members of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and PI3K/AKT signalling pathways was reduced by Corilagin. In a murine model of osteoporosis, Corilagin inhibited osteoclast functions in vivo and restored oestrogen deficiency-induced bone loss. In conclusion, our findings suggested that Corilagin inhibited osteoclastogenesis by down-regulating the NF-kappaB and PI3K/AKT signalling pathways, thus showing its potential possibility for the treatment of osteoporosis.

1	[GC-MS analysis and cytotoxic activity of the supercritical extracts from roots and stems of Zanthoxylum nitidum].The volatile components of roots and stems of Zanthoxylum nitidum were investigated by supercritical fluid carbon dioxide extraction (SFE-CO2) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry(GC-MS). Thirty-one and fifty-one compounds were identified in the supercritical extracts from roots and stems of Z. nitidum, respectively, and total twenty-seven compounds were the common constituents. Among them, the major constituents in root and stem supercritical extracts were spathulenol (18.49 and 26.18%), n-hexadecanoic acid (14.24% and 12.79%), ar-tumerone (6.95% and 8.88%), oleic acid (8.39% and 5.71%) and hexanoic acid (4.39% and 7.78%). The in-vitro MTT assay showed that the volatile components of roots and stems of Z. nitidum did not exhibited any cytotoxic activity against human cancer Huh-7 and normal IEC-6 cells. These results indicated the same nature of the volatile constituents in the root and stem of Z. nitidum. This investigation may provide further evidence for expansion of medicinal parts of Z. nitidum.	z. nitidum ar-tumerone
1	Exploration of nutraceutical potential of herbal oil formulated from parasitic plant.BACKGROUND: Cuscuta reflexa (C. reflexa) is a parasitic climber of medicinal importance. The present study was aimed to evaluate the nutraceutical potential of C. reflexa stems collected from different hosts and to evaluate the role of the herbal formulation in dandruff, hair fall control as well as hair growth promoter. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hair formulations of C. reflexa collected from different host plants were prepared in the form of herbal oils (10% w/v). C. reflexa stems were extracted using mustard oil as base oil by using direct boiling technique. Prepared oil was studied as hair tonic. The experimental protocols used were anti-dandruff hair growth activity, as well as hair fall reduction. Herbal hair oils versus mustard oil were evaluated by applying oils on human volunteers with hair fall and dandruff problem whereas promotion of hair growth activity was conducted on rats. The formulated oils were also characterised for proximate analysis, physiochemical composition, as well as antimicrobial activity. RESULT: The test oils of C. reflexa collected from Azadiracta indica and Zizyphus jujuba were effective in the promotion of hair growth, dandruff control, as well as reduction in hair fall activity. CONCLUSION: All the formulated oils showed potent antimicrobial activity against all selected strains of bacteria and fungi.	c. reflexa mustard oil
1	Chemical composition and antibacterial activities of the essential oil from Abies koreana.The essential oils from an alpine needle leaf of Abies koreana, which is a species native to Korea, was obtained by hydrodistillation with 0.9% (v/w) yield and analysed by GC and GC-MS. Sixty-eight constituents, accounting for more than 95.9% of the total oil composition, were identified. The main compounds with concentrations higher than 3% were borneol (27.9%), alpha-pinene (23.2%), beta-pinene (5.8%), terpinene-4-ol (3.8%), bornyl acetate (3.4%) and alpha-terpineol (3.1%). The antibacterial activity of the oil was evaluated against nine microorganisms using disc diffusion and broth microdilution methods. The essential oil exhibited some broad spectrum antibacterial activity against the tested organisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.	abies koreana beta-pinene
1	Evaluation of the quality of Chinese and Vietnamese cassia using LC-MS and multivariate analysis.In the present study, the chemical composition of water extracts of Chinese and Vietnamese cassia (Cinnamomum cassia) were compared using multivariate analysis of LC-MS data. By principal component analysis of the LC-MS data, 6 compounds, cinnzeylanine (1), cinnzeylanol (2), anhydrocinnzeylanol (3), cinncasinol A (4), epicatechin (5) and procyanidin B2 (6), were identified as the marker compounds to characterize Chinese and Vietnamese cassia. It was clarified that Chinese cassia contains relatively larger amounts of epicatechin and procyanidin B2. On the other hand, Vietnamese cassia is characterized by a relatively larger amount of diterpenes. As catechin derivatives and diterpenes have different types of activity, it is important to choose the cassia that best suits the product for which it is to be used, whether in food or in herbal medicine.	cinnamomum cassia cinnzeylanine
4	Asperindoles A-D and a p-Terphenyl Derivative from the Ascidian-Derived Fungus Aspergillus sp. KMM 4676.Four new indole-diterpene alkaloids asperindoles A-D (1-4) and the known p-terphenyl derivative 3&amp;Prime;-hydroxyterphenyllin (5) were isolated from the marine-derived strain of the fungus Aspergillus sp., associated with an unidentified colonial ascidian. The structures of 1-5 were established by 2D NMR and HRESIMS data. The absolute configurations of all stereocenters of 1-4 were determined by the combination of ROESY data, coupling constants analysis, and biogenetic considerations. Asperindoles C and D contain a 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid (2-HIBA) residue, rarely found in natural compounds. Asperindole A exhibits cytotoxic activity against hormone therapy-resistant PC-3 and 22Rv1, as well as hormone therapy-sensitive human prostate cancer cells, and induces apoptosis in these cells at low-micromolar concentrations.	pc-3 and 22rv1 prostate cancer
3	Antioxidative Activity of Flavonoids from Abrus cantoniensis against Ethanol-Induced Gastric Ulcer in Mice.The present study investigated the flavonoids from Abrus cantoniensis against ethanol-induced gastric ulcers in mice. The flavonoids from A. cantoniensis were extracted with ethanol and purified by macroporous resin and polyamide. The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl assay was used to measure the antioxidative activities in vitro. The ethanol-induced ulcer mouse model was used to evaluate the gastroprotective activities of the flavonoids from A. cantoniensis. In addition, a method was established to ensure accuracy for animal ulcer evaluation. The flavonoids from A. cantoniensis showed a strong free radical scavenging capacity with an IC50 of 43.83 microg/mL in the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl assay. At doses between 28.16-112.67 mg/kg, the flavonoids conspicuously reduced the ulcer index in ethanol-induced mice (p&lt;0.001). Significant differences were found in the levels of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione, and myeloperoxidase in the stomach tissues between the flavonoids from the A. cantoniensis groups and the ethanol control group. The gastroprotective effect of the flavonoids from A. cantoniensis could be due to its antioxidative activity of the defensive mechanism. The data revealed that the flavonoids from A. cantoniensis could be a potential therapeutic agent for gastric ulcer prevention and treatment.	flavonoids ulcer
1	MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and PSD fragmentation as means for the analysis of condensed tannins in plant leaves and needles.MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and 13C NMR spectroscopy were applied to unveil typical characteristics of condensed tannins of leaves and needles from willow (Salix alba), spruce (Picea abies) and beech (Fagus sylvatica) of three tree species that are ubiquitous in German forests and landscapes. For further evaluation, lime (Tilia cordata) was included. The 13C NMR spectroscopy confirmed the purity of the condensed tannin fractions and the efficiency of the procedure used for their extraction. While signals representative for procyanidin units are observable in all liquid-state 13C NMR spectra, resonance lines of prodelphinidin were only detected in those obtained from the condensed tannins of spruce needles and beech leaves. Typical signals in the chemical shift region between 70 and 90 ppm demonstrated the presence of stereoisomers (catechin/epicatechin; gallocatechin/ epigallocatechin). The MALDI-TOF mass spectra of the condensed tannins show signals of polymers of up to undecamers. Supporting the observations from the NMR spectroscopy, the mass spectra of the willow and lime leaf condensed tannins were identified as polymers with mainly procyanidin units, while the polymers of the spruce needle and beech leaves exhibit varying procyanidin/prodelphinidin ratios. Post source decay (PSD) fragmentation lead to a sequential loss of monomers and allowed a detailed characterization and sequencing of individual chains. In the case of the condensed tannins of lime this technique clearly excludes a pelargonidin terminal unit followed by a prodelphinidin unit, which would result in the same molecular masses as a polymer solely built up of procyanidin units.	lime procyanidin
1	A cytotoxic secocycloartenoid from Abies koreana.Two triterpenoids, 24-methylene-3,4-seco-cycloart-4(28)-en-3-oic acid (1) and 3-oxo-9beta-lanosta-7,22Z,24-trien-26,23-olide (6) were isolated from Abies koreana, together with beta-sitosterol (2), maltol (3), beta-sitosterol-O-beta-D-glucoside (4), and hexacosylferulate (5). The structures of the compounds were established based on the spectroscopic data. The cytotoxic activities of triterpenoids have been evaluated using the sulforhodamine B (SRB) method. Compound 1 showed moderate cytotoxicities against human lung carcinoma (A549), ovarian carcinoma (SK-OV-3), malignant melanoma (SK-MEL-2), and colon carcinoma (HCT-15) cell lines.	abies koreana triterpenoids
4	Water extract of Cinnamomum cassia suppresses angiogenesis through inhibition of VEGF receptor 2 phosphorylation.Angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation, has been a major target for cancer therapy. Antiangiogenic herbal medicines are useful in the treatment of cancer. In this study, we found that a water extract of Cinnamomum cassia (CCWE) was a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis. In cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells, CCWE suppressed vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced proliferation, migration, invasion, tube formation, and intracellular signaling events such as phosphorylation of ERK, p38 and VEGFR2, and activation of matrix metalloproteinase. Furthermore, CCWE inhibited VEGF-induced vessel sprouting of rat aorta ex vivo. These findings might be of particular interest for drug development because VEGF signaling is a potential target for treatment of angiogenesis-associated diseases. 	p38 cancer
1	Structural characterization of polysaccharides from Zizyphus jujuba and evaluation of antioxidant activity.Fruit of Zizyphus jujuba Mill, a traditional Chinese herb widely consumed in Asian countries, has been reported to possess several vital biological activities. This study intends to develop an appropriate analytical method for isolation of polysaccharides from Z. jujuba fruits and evaluate their antioxidant activity. Initially, powdered Z. jujuba fruits were subjected to hot water extraction, followed by ethanol precipitation, deproteination, dialysis and fractionation in a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column. One neutral polysaccharide fraction (ZJPN) and 3 acidic polysaccharide fractions (ZJPa1, ZJPa2 and ZJPa3) were isolated with the average MW ranging from 40,566 to 129,518 Da. GC analysis revealed that 6 monosaccharides, namely, rhamnose, arabinose, xylose, mannose, glucose and galactose were present in polysaccharide fractions. The galacturonic acid content in polysaccharide fractions followed the order: ZJPa3&gt;ZJPa2&gt;ZJPa1&gt;ZJPN. All the 4 polysaccharide fractions were found to be more effective in scavenging superoxide anions than hydroxyl radicals, while acidic polysaccharides showed a more pronounced effect in chelating ferrous ion.	z. jujuba glucose
1	Fumigant toxicity of cassia and cinnamon oils and cinnamaldehyde and structurally related compounds to Dermanyssus gallinae (Acari: Dermanyssidae).The toxicity of two cassia oils, four cinnamon oils and (E)-cinnamaldehyde and (E)-cinnamic acid and 34 structurally related compounds to adult Dermanyssus gallinae (De Geer) collected from a poultry house was examined using a vapour-phase mortality bioassay. Results were compared with those of dichlorvos, a conventional acaricide. The cassia and cinnamon oils (cinnamon technical, cinnamon #500, cassia especial, cassia true, cinnamon bark and cinnamon green leaf) exhibited good fumigant toxicity (LD(50), 11.79-26.40 mug cm(-3)). alpha-Methyl-(E)-cinnamaldehyde (LD(50), 0.45 mug cm(-3)) and (E)-cinnamaldehyde (0.54 mug cm(-3)) were the most toxic compounds and the toxicity of these compounds was comparable to that of dichlorvos (0.30 mug cm(-3)). Potent fumigant toxicity was also observed in allyl cinnamate, ethyl-alpha-cyanocinnamate, (E)-2-methoxylcinnamic acid and (Z)-2-methoxylcinnamic acid (LD(50), 0.81-0.92 mug cm(-3)). Structure-activity relationships indicate that structural characteristics, such as types of functional groups and carbon skeleton rather than vapour pressure parameter, appear to play a role in determining toxicity. The essential oils and compounds described merit further study as potential acaricides for the control of D. gallinae populations as fumigants with contact action due to global efforts to reduce the level of highly toxic synthetic acaricides in the agricultural environment.	cinnamon alpha-Methyl-(E)-cinnamaldehyde
3	Cytotoxic lignan esters from Cinnamomum osmophloeum.The bark and roots of Cinnamomum osmophloeum are widely used in Taiwan as spice substitutes for C. CASSIA. We have isolated three novel lignan esters, one dibenzylbutane-type ligan ester [9,9'-di-O-feruloyl-(+)-5,5'-dimethoxy secoisolariciresinol (3)] and two cyclolignan esters [(7' S,8' R,8 R) -lyoniresinol-9-O-(E)-feruloyl ester ( 5) and (7' S,8' R,8 R)-lyoniresinol-9,9'-di-O-(E)-feruloyl ester (6)], and several known lignans from the heartwood and roots of C. osmophloeum. We identified these compounds using 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Cytotoxicity assays of these novel lignan esters revealed that compound 6 has strong activities against human liver cancer (HepG2 and Hep3B) and oral cancer (Ca9-22) cells, with IC(50) values of 7.87, 4.31, and 2.51 microg/mL, respectively.	lignan esters Cytotoxicity
3	Enrichment and Purification of the Bioactive Flavonoids from Flower of Abelmoschus manihot (L.) Medic Using Macroporous Resins.Flower of Abelmoschus manihot (FAM) is clinically effective to treat chronic kidney disease (CKD) with a relatively high dosage. To improve the efficacy and the compliance of patients, macroporous resins were adopted to enrich and purify flavonoids from FAM, which are thought to be the major renal protective constituents in FAM. After screening six different kinds of macroporous resins, HPD-100 was selected for its great adsorption and desorption capacity. Then, orthogonal design tests were used to optimize parameters in the processes of impurity removal and flavonoids of FAM desorption on column chromatogram. Moreover, process scale-up was performed, and purification effects maintained after amplification. After purification, the content of seven main flavonoids in the product increased from 8.29% to 51.43%. Protective and anti-inflammatory effects of crude extract and the flavonoid component of FAM after purification were investigated on the adriamycin-damaged HK-2 cells and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated Raw 264.7 cells models. Both bioactivities were improved greatly after purification for these two cell models. Therefore, the purification process had enriched the main bioactive constituents with potential alleviating kidney injury activities. The flavonoid component of FAM is worthy of being developed as an improved remedy for CKD with better patients' compliance.	flavonoid chronic kidney disease
2	Plant toxin abrin induced oxidative stress mediated neurodegenerative changes in mice.Abrin is a potent plant toxin. It is a heterodimeric protein toxin which is obtained from the seeds of Abrus precatorius plant. At cellular level abrin causes protein synthesis inhibition by removing the specific adenine residue (A4324) from the 28s rRNA of the 60S - ribosomal subunit. In the present study we investigated the role of oxidative stress in neurotoxic potential and demyelinating effects of abrin on brain. The mechanism by which abrin induces oxidative damage and toxicity in brain are relatively unknown. Animals were exposed to 0.4 and 1.0 LD50 abrin dose by intraperitoneal route and observed for 1 and 3 day post-toxin exposure. Oxidative stress occurred in brain due to abrin was confirmed in terms of increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathione depletion and increased lipid peroxidation. Significant increase in blood and brain ROS was observed at day 3, 1 LD50. Abrin induced changes in the neurotransmitters (5-hydroxy tryptamine, norepinephrine, dopamine and monoamine oxidase) levels were evaluated by spectroflourometry. Increase in the levels of 5-HT and NE was observed after abrin exposure. MAO activity was found to be decreased in abrin exposed animals compared to control. Significant inhibition in the activity of acetylcholine esterase enzyme in brain and serum was reported for both the doses and time points. Western blot analysis of iNOS expression indicated that abrin treatment resulted in dose and time dependent increase. Furthermore, protein expression of myelin basic protein (MBP) was down regulated in a dose and time dependent manner. Brain histopathology was carried out and cortical brain region showed demyelination after abrin exposure. Results confirmed that abrin poisoning leads to neurodegeneration and neurotoxicity mediated through oxidative stress, AChE inhibition, lipid peroxidation and decrease in MBP levels. 	abrus precatorius toxicity
3	Cinnamaldehyde inhibits lymphocyte proliferation and modulates T-cell differentiation.Two kinds of cinnamaldehyde derivative, 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (HCA) and 2'-benzoxy-cinnamaldehyde (BCA), were studied for their immunomodulatory effects. These compounds were screened as anticancer drug candidates from stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia for their inhibitory effect on farnesyl protein transferase activity. Ras activation, which is accompanied with its farnesylation, has been known to be important in immune cell activation as well as in carcinogenesis. Treatment of these cinnamaldehydes to mouse splenocyte cultures induced suppression of lymphoproliferation following both Con A and LPS stimulation in a dose-dependent manner. A dose of I microM of HCA and BCA inhibited the Con A-stimulated proliferation by 69% and 60%, and the LPS-induced proliferation by 29% and 21%, respectively. However, the proliferation induced by PMA plus ionomycin was affected by neither HCA nor BCA treatment. Decreased levels of antibody production by HCA or BCA treatment were observed in both SRBC-immunized mice and LPS-stimulated splenocyte cultures. The exposure of thymocytes to HCA or BCA for 48 h accelerated T-cell differentiation from CD4 and CD8 double positive cells to CD4 or CD8 single positive cells. The inhibitory effect of cinnamaldehyde on lymphoproliferation was specific to the early phase of cell activation, showing the strongest inhibition of Con A- or LPS-stimulated proliferation when added concomitantly with the mitogens. In addition, the treatment of HCA and BCA to splenocyte cultures attenuated the Con A-triggered progression of cell cycle at G1 phase with no inhibition of S to G2/M phase transition. Although cinnamaldehyde treatment had no effect on the IL-2 production by splenocyte cultures stimulated with Con A, it inhibited markedly and dose-dependently the expression of IL-2Ralpha and interferon-gamma. Taken together, the results in this study suggest both HCA and BCA inhibit the lymphoproliferation and induce a T-cell differentiation through the blockade of early steps in signaling pathway leading to cell growth.	2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde suppression of lymphoproliferation
4	Antiproliferative Activity of Cinnamomum cassia Constituents and Effects of Pifithrin-Alpha on Their Apoptotic Signaling Pathways in Hep G2 Cells.Cinnamaldehyde (Cin), cinnamic acid (Ca) and cinnamyl alcohol (Cal), major constituents of Cinnamomum cassia, have been shown to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer and other activities. In this study, our aim was to evaluate the antiproliferative activity of these compounds in human hepatoma Hep G2 cells and examine the effects of pifithrin-alpha (PFTalpha; a specific p53 inhibitor) on their apoptotic signaling transduction mechanism. The antiproliferative activity was measured by XTT assay. Expression of apoptosis-related proteins was detected by western blotting. Results showed that at a concentration of 30 muM, the order of antiproliferative activity in Hep G2 cells was Cin &gt; Ca &gt; Cal. Cin (IC(50) 9.76 +- 0.67 muM) demonstrated an antiproliferative potency as good as 5-fluorouracil (an anti-cancer drug; IC(50) 9.57 +- 0.61 muM). Further studies on apoptotic mechanisms of Cin showed that it downregulated the expression of Bcl-(XL), upregulated CD95 (APO-1), p53 and Bax proteins, as well as cleaving the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in a time-dependent pattern. PFTalpha pre-incubation significantly diminished the effect of Cin-induced apoptosis. It markedly upregulated the anti-apoptotic (Bcl-(XL)) expression and downregulated the pro-apoptotic (Bax) expression, as well as effectively blocking the CD95 (APO-1) and p53 expression, and PARP cleavage in Cin-treated cells. This study indicates that Cin was the most potent antiproliferative constituent of C. cassia, and its apoptotic mechanism in Hep G2 cells could be mediated through the p53 induction and CD95 (APO-1) signaling pathways.

1	Indoleacetic acid derivatives from the seeds of Ziziphus jujuba var. spinosa.A pair of diastereoisomers, the N-glycosylated derivatives of dioxindole-3-hydroxy-3-acetic acid 1-2, and their conjugates with flavonoids 3-8, was isolated from the seeds of Ziziphus jujuba var. spinosa. Their structures were elucidated by NMR spectroscopic analyses, and the absolute configurations were determined by circular dichroism method. Compounds 3-10 were evaluated for the antioxidant capacity, using the radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay. 	ziziphus jujuba var indoleacetic acid
2	Toxicological interactions of Abrus precatorius and Cassia senna in the diet of Lohmann broiler chicks.The combination of 0.5% Abrus precatorius seed and 2% Cassia senna fruit in the diet of Lohmann broiler chicks caused severe lesions, reduced weight gain, inefficient feed utilization and anemia. Organ lesions correlated with changes in clinical chemistry and hematology. Tissue recovery was not complete 2 w following withdrawal of the test diet. Feeding 0.5% Abrus or 2% Senna diets alone produced decreased growth and tissue lesions that did not return to normal 2 w following return to normal rations.	abrus precatorius anemia
3	Cinnamaldehyde affects the biological behavior of human colorectal cancer cells and induces apoptosis via inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.Cinnamaldehyde (CA) is a bioactive compound isolated from the stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia, that has been identified as an antiproliferative substance with pro-apoptotic effects on various cancer cell lines in vitro. In the present study, the effects of CA on human colon cancer cells were investigated at both the molecular and cellular levels. Three types of colorectal cancer cells at various stages of differentiation and invasive ability (SW480, HCT116 and LoVo) were treated with CA at final concentrations of 20, 40 and 80 microg/ml for 24 h. Compared with the control group, the proliferation inhibition rate of the human colorectal cancer cells following treatment with CA increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The invasion and adhesion abilities of the cells were significantly inhibited as indicated by Transwell and cell-matrix adhesion assays. Meanwhile, CA also upregulated the expression of E-cadherin and downregulated the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9. CA also elevated the apoptotic rate. The levels of pro-apoptotic genes were upregulated while the levels of apoptosis inhibitory genes were decreased which further confirmed the pro-apoptotic effect of CA. In order to explore the mechanism of CA-induced apoptosis, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) were used to regulate the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway. The transcription activity of PI3K/AKT was markedly inhibited by CA, as well as IGF-1 which functions as an anti-apoptotic factor. In conclusion, CA has the potential to be developed as a new antitumor drug. The mechanisms of action involve the regulation of expression of genes involved in apoptosis, invasion and adhesion via inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.	Cinnamaldehyde colorectal cancer
1	Comparative analysis of chemical compositions and antimicrobial activities of essential oils from Abies holophylla and Abies koreana activities of essential oils from Abies holophylla and Abies koreana.The chemical compositions and antibacterial and antifungal activities of essential oils extracted from Abies holophylla and A. koreana were investigated. GC-MS analysis revealed that 38 compounds comprised 95.88% of the A. holophylla essential oil, with the main components being bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-ol (28.05%), delta3-carene (13.85%), alpha-pinene (11.68%), camphene (10.41%), dl-limonene (7.61%), beta-myrcene (7.11%), trans-caryophyllene (5.36%), and alpha- bisabolol (3.67%). In the essential oil from A. koreana, 36 compounds comprised 98.67% of the oil, and the main compounds were bornyl ester (41.79%), camphene (15.31%), alpha-pinene (11.19%), dl-limonene (8.58%), fenchyl acetate (5.55%), and alpha-terpinene (2.29%). Both essential oils showed great potential of antibacterial activity against several bacteria tested, in the range of 2.2-8.8 mug per disc by the agar disc diffusion method, and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 5.5-21.8 mg/ml by the microdilution method. Both oils showed very effective antifungal activities toward all pathogenic strains tested, including Candida glabrata, with MIC values in the range of 0.5-2.2 mg/ml. As a whole, A.koreanaoil showed better antibacterial and antifungal properties than A.holophylla oil.	a. holophylla camphene
0	Protective effect of cinnamaldehyde against glutamate-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in PC12 cells.Cinnamaldehyde is a main ingredient of cinnamon oils from the stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia, which has been widely used in food and traditional herbal medicine in Asia. In the present study, the neuroprotective effects and the potential mechanisms of cinnamaldehyde against glutamate-induced oxidative stress in PC12 cells were investigated. Exposure to 4mM glutamate altered the GSH, MDA levels and SOD activity, caused the generation of reactive oxygen species, resulted in the induction of oxidative stress in PC12 cell, ultimately induced cell death. However, pretreatment with cinnamaldehyde at 5, 10 and 20muM significantly attenuated cell viability loss, reduced the generation of reactive oxygen species, stabilised mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), decreased the release of cytochrome c and limited the activities of caspase-9 and -3. In addition, cinnamaldehyde also markedly increased Bcl-2 while inhibiting Bax expression,and decreased the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio. These results indicate that cinnamaldehyde exists a potential protective effect against glutamate-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in PC12 cells.	cinnamaldehyde Bax
2	Antiproliferative activities of Fagara xanthoxyloides and Pseudocedrela kotschyi against prostate cancer cell lines.BACKGROUND/AIM: Roots of Fagara zanthoxyloides and Pseudocedrela kotchyii are used as chewing sticks and as medicinal remedies for diarrhea, cough and fever in West Africa. Extracts of the two plants also possess anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and anti-malarial activities. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of such extracts on the growth, proliferation and induction of apoptosis in four prostate cancer cell lines. Materials and Methods. Androgen-independent PC3 and DU-145 and androgen-dependent LNCaP and CWR-22 prostate cancer cell lines were cultured for five days with different concentrations of the extracts and examined for growth inhibition and evidence of apoptosis. RESULTS: Irrespective of their androgen dependence, all four cancer cell lines exhibited a dose-dependent decrease in cell proliferation and viability by the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and in induction of apoptosis. The results also show that LNCap cells were the most sensitive to the two extracts, with highest inhibition at day 3 and exhibiting the highest rate of apoptosis. Conclusion. These observations suggest that F. zanthoxyloides and P. kotchyii could serve as potential chemopreventive agents in the treatment of prostate cancer.	Pseudocedrela prostate cancer
2	Interaction profile of Zizyphus jujuba with phenytoin, phenobarbitone, and carbamazepine in maximal electroshock-induced seizures in rats.The antiepileptic effect of hydroalcoholic extract of Zizyphus jujuba (HEZJ) in experimental seizures was demonstrated earlier. The present study aimed to evaluate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions of HEZJ with phenytoin (PHT), phenobarbitone (PB), and carbamazepine (CBZ) in maximal electroshock (MES)-induced seizures in male Wistar rats. Maximal electroshock (70 mA, 9 ms pulse width, 0.2 s) was used to induce seizures. Blood samples were collected at two time points for estimation of serum PHT, PB, and CBZ levels using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Co-administration of HEZJ with the sub-therapeutic doses of PHT, PB, and CBZ exhibited 66.7, 66.7, and 50.0% protection against tonic hind limb extension as compared to 33.3, 33.3, and 50% protection respectively, in the groups treated with PHT, PB, and CBZ alone in their sub-therapeutic doses. Co-administration of HEZJ with the sub-therapeutic doses of these antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) showed significant improvement in cognitive functions as compared to MES group as well as these AEDs alone. A significant increase in glutathione levels and decrease in malondialdehyde levels were observed with pretreatment of HEZJ with the sub-therapeutic doses of these AEDs. Co-administration of HEZJ with PHT, PB, and CBZ did not cause any significant changes in the serum concentrations of these AEDs. The results of the present study indicate that the co-administration of HEZJ with sub-therapeutic doses of PHT and PB potentiated the antiepileptic effect of PHT and PB in MES-induced seizures with no change found in the antiepileptic effect of CBZ.	zizyphus jujuba seizures
1	Incorporation and remobilization of 13C within the fine-root systems of individual Abies alba trees in a temperate coniferous stand.Forest ecosystems have a large carbon (C) storage capacity, which depends on their productivity and the residence time of C. Therefore, the time interval between C assimilation and its return to the atmosphere is an important parameter for determining C storage. Especially fine roots (&lt;=2 mm in diameter) undergo constant replacement and provide a large biomass input to the soil. In this study, we aimed to determine the residence time of C in living fine roots and the decomposition rates of dead fine roots. Therefore, we pulse-labelled nine 20-year-old individual silver fir trees (Abies alba Miller; ~70 cm tall) with 13CO2 in situ to trace the assimilated C over time into the fine-root systems. Whole trees were harvested at different time points after labelling in autumn, biomass was determined and cellulose and starch of fine roots were extracted. Moreover, soil cores were taken and ingrowth cores installed, in which fine roots were genetically identified, to assess incorporation and remobilization of 13C in the fine roots of silver fir trees; litterbags were used to determine fine-root decomposition rates. The 13C label was incorporated in the fine-root system as cellulose within 3 days, with highest values after 30 days, before reaching background levels after 1 year. The highest delta13C values were found in starch throughout the experiment. 13C recovery and carbon mean residence times did not differ significantly among fine-root diameter classes, indicating size-independent C turnover times in fine roots of A. alba trees of ~219 days. Furthermore, carbon was remobilized from starch into newly grown fine roots in the next spring after our autumn labelling. One year after installation, litterbags with fine roots revealed a decrease of biomass of ~40% with relative 13C content in fine-root bulk biomass and cellulose of ~50%, indicating a faster loss of 13C-labelled compounds compared with bulk biomass. Our results also suggest that genetic analysis of fine-root fragments found in soil and ingrowth cores is advisable when working in mixed forest stands with trees of similar fine-root morphology. Only then can one avoid dilution of the labelling signal by mistake, due to analysis of non-labelled non-target species roots.	a. alba cellulose
3	Delayed occurrence of H-ras12V-induced hepatocellular carcinoma with long-term treatment with cinnamaldehydes.Cinnamaldehyde from the bark of Cinnamomum cassia has been reported to have antitumor activity mediated by the inhibition of farnesyl transferase. We assessed in vivo the chemo-preventive effect of cinnamaldehydes on H-ras12V-induced hepatocellular carcinoma formation. A mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma was established by using the transgene of mutated H-ras12V under the regulation of albumin enhancer/promoter. When treated with cinnamaldehyde for 10 weeks, hepatic tumor development was delayed with 2'-benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde (BCA) compared with control hepatocellular carcinoma formation. The effect of 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (HCA) was comparable. The number of lesions and the size of each lesion were significantly reduced by BCA. Cell proliferation in the lesion was detected by incorporation of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU). BCA increased the number of splenocytes, concanavalin A-stimulated splenocyte proliferation and the infiltration of lymphocytes into liver. Data suggest that the delayed hepatic tumor development observed with BCA could be mediated by a long-term immunostimulating effect on T cells.	BCA hepatic tumor
2	[Study on the Chinese herbal formula for treatment of vaginitis and the antimicrobial activity in murine models].OBJECTIVE: To study on the various proportions of Radix Sophorae Flavescentis, Cortex Phellodendri, Fructus Cnidii and pericarp of Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim in the formulas, whose antimicrobial effects on E. coli, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and C. albicans under different pH values were compared in vitro. METHODS: According to Chinese ancient proved recipe, the K-B method and plate diluting method were adopted to measure antimicrobial activity, and orthogonal design to ascertain the herbal formula in vitro. Finally, murine models were established to test the antimicrobial activity in vivo through vaginal membrane irritancy experiment, negative rate of pathogeny and pathological grade of vaginal membrane. RESULTS: The results suggested that formulas with different proportions of the herbs had diverse antimicrobial activities, and the effect was shown to be most obvious when one milliliter drug contains 100 microl Fructus Cnidii-pericarp of Zanthoxylum bungeanum (2:1) co-extracted volatile oil and 50 microl Radix Sophorae Flavescentis and Cortex Phenodendri ethanol extraction respectively under pH6. The antimicrobial effect of the formula, which hardly had any membrane irritancy, was better than Jie Eryin in vitro and vivo. CONCLUSION: The fromula has few components and better effect, and adaptation to the pH value of vaginitis. It is a promising alternative for gynecological diseases.	zanthoxylum bungeanum vaginitis
1	Purification and characterization of flavonoids from the leaves of Zanthoxylum bungeanum and correlation between their structure and antioxidant activity.Nine flavonoids were isolated and characterized from the leaves of Zanthoxylum bungeanum. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic techniques as quercetin (1), afzelin (2), quercitrin (3), trifolin (4), quercetin-3-O-beta-D-glucoside (5), isorhamnetin 3-O-alpha-L-rhamnoside (6), hyperoside (7), vitexin (8) and rutin (9). All compounds were isolated from the leaves of Z. bungeanum for the first time. Five compounds (2, 4, 5, 6 and 8) were found for the first time in the genus Zanthoxylum. To learn the mechanisms underlying its health benefits, in vitro (DPPH, ABTS, FRAP and lipid peroxidation inhibition assays) and in vivo (protective effect on Escherichia coli under peroxide stress) antioxidant activities of the nine flavonoids were measured. Quercetin and quercetin glycosides (compounds 1, 3, 5, 7, 9) showed the highest antioxidant activity. Structure-activity relationships indicated that the -OH in 4' position on the B ring and the -OH in 7 position on the A ring possessed high antioxidant activity; B ring and/or A ring with adjacent -OH groups could greatly increase their antioxidant ability. Also, due to the different structures of various flavonoids, they will certainly exhibit different antioxidant capacity when the reactions occur in solution or in oil-in-water emulsion. These findings suggest that Z. bungeanum leaves may have health benefits when consumed. It could become a useful supplement for pharmaceutical products and functional food ingredients in both nutraceutical and food industries as a potential source of natural antioxidants. 	z. bungeanum afzelin
2	The glycaemic outcomes of Cinnamon, a review of the experimental evidence and clinical trials.INTRODUCTION: Cinnamon is currently marketed as a remedy for obesity, glucose intolerance, diabetes mellitus and dyslipidaemia. Integrative medicine is a new concept that combines conventional treatment with evidence-based complementary therapies. AIM: The aim of this review is to critically evaluate the experimental evidence available for cinnamon in improving glycaemic targets in animal models and humans. RESULTS: Insulin receptor auto-phosphorlylation and de-phosphorylation, glucose transporter 4 (GLUT-4 ) receptor synthesis and translocation, modulation of hepatic glucose metabolism through changes in Pyruvate kinase (PK) and Phosphenol Pyruvate Carboxikinase (PEPCK), altering the expression of PPAR (gamma) and inhibition of intestinal glucosidases are some of the mechanisms responsible for improving glycaemic control with cinnamon therapy. We reviewed 8 clinical trials that used Cinnamomum cassia in aqueous or powder form in doses ranging from 500 mg to 6 g per day for a duration lasting from 40 days to 4 months as well as 2 clinical trials that used cinnamon on treatment naive patients with pre-diabetes. An improvement in glycaemic control was seen in patients who received Cinnamon as the sole therapy for diabetes, those with pre-diabetes (IFG or IGT) and in those with high pre-treatment HbA1c. In animal models, cinnamon reduced fasting and postprandial plasma glucose and HbA1c. CONCLUSION: Cinnamon has the potential to be a useful add-on therapy in the discipline of integrative medicine in managing type 2 diabetes. At present the evidence is inconclusive and long-term trials aiming to establish the efficacy and safety of cinnamon is needed. However, high coumarin content of Cinnamomum cassia is a concern, but Cinnamomum zeylanicum with its low coumarin content would be a safer alternate.	cinnamomum zeylanicum diabetes
0	The cardioprotective effect of total flavonoids on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion in rats.The flowers of Abelmoschus manihot (L.) Medic is a traditional Chinese medicine used for the treatment of ischemic diseases. The present study is to investigate whether total flavones (TA) of extracted from Abelmoschus manihot L. Medic has the potential cardioprotective effect on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) damage in rats. The index of myocardial injury, inflammatory biomarkers and NLRP3-related parameters were measured, respectively. The results demonstrated that compared to I/R group, TA reduced myocardial infarction area, declined serum creatinine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, attenuated serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1beta and tumour necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) production. Moreover, TA markedly enhanced the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and reduced the amounts of malondialdehyde (MDA) in I/R rats. In addition, TA reduced myocardial I/R induced injury in rats by inhibiting NLRPR3 inflammasome. Thus, it is assumed that TA could significantly improve myocardial I/R injury in rats partially through suppressing NLRP3 activtion.	flavonoids NLRP3
3	Nitidine chloride prevents OVX-induced bone loss via suppressing NFATc1-mediated osteoclast differentiation.Nitidine chloride (NC), a bioactive alkaloid isolated from Zanthoxylum nitidum, has been used as a herbal ingredient in toothpaste that prevents cavities for decades. It also displays potential antitumor and anti-inflammation properties. However, its anticatabolic effect on bone is not known. We investigated the effect of NC on osteoclastogenesis, bone resorption and RANKL-induced NF-kappaB and NFATc1 signalling. In mouse-derived bone marrow monocytes (BMMs), NC suppressed RANKL-induced multinucleated tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive osteoclast formation and bone resorption in a dose dependent manner. NC attenuated the expression of osteoclast marker genes including cathepsin K, D2, calcitonin receptor, NFATc1, and TRAP. Further, NC inhibited RANKL-activated NF-kappaB and NFATc1 signalling pathways. In vivo study revealed that NC abrogated oestrogen deficiency-induced bone loss in ovariectomized mice. Histological analysis showed that the number of osteoclasts was significantly lower in NC-treated groups. Collectively, our data demonstrate that NC suppressed osteoclastogenesis and prevented OVX-induced bone loss by inhibiting RANKL-induced NF-kappaB and NFATc1 signalling pathways. NC may be a natural and novel treatment for osteoclast-related bone lytic diseases.	NC bone loss
2	In vitro anti-diabetic activity of Sclerocarya birrea and Ziziphus mucronata.Type 2 diabetes mellitus is on the increase worldwide. Current treatments possess undesirable side-effects and therefore investigations into alternative remedies, which may be cost-effective and devoid of such side-effects, are on-going. Aqueous and methanol extracts of the bark of Sclerocarya birrea (A. Rich.) Hochst. subsp. caffra (Sond.) Kokwaro (Anacardiaceae) and Ziziphus mucronata Willd. subsp. mucronata (Rhamnaceae) were subjected to testing in order to assess their in vitro anti-diabetic activity. Total polyphenolic content and antioxidant activity, as well as the effect on alpha-amylase, alpha-glucosidase and cytotoxicity, were measured. Furthermore, glucose uptake was evaluated in C2C12 myotubes, 3T3-L1 adipocytes and HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells, and insulin secretion in RIN-m5F rat pancreatic beta-cells. The extracts of both plants inhibited the activities of alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase in a concentration dependent manner, with results being comparable with the positive control, acarbose. All the extracts contained antioxidant activity, with the methanol extracts of S. birrea displaying the strongest free radical scavenging capacity (IC50 = 2.16 microg/mL). Most of the extracts were not cytotoxic to the cell lines with IC50 values &gt; 100 microg/mL. Extracts of both plants significantly increased glucose uptake in C2C12, 3T3-L1 and HepG2 cells. However, insulin secretion from RIN-m5F cells was not altered. This study provides evidence that the plants possess in vitro anti-diabetic properties.	ziziphus mucronata willd. subsp diabetic
3	Abies koreana essential oil inhibits drug-resistant skin pathogen growth and LPS-induced inflammatory effects of murine macrophage.Since acne vulgaris is the combined result of a bacterial infection and the inflammatory response to that infection, we examined whether Abies koreana essential oil (AKE) possessed anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activities against skin pathogens. In this study, AKE showed excellent antibacterial activities against drug-susceptible and -resistant Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis, which are acne-causing bacteria. In addition, AKE reduced the LPS-induced secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, NO and PGE(2) in RAW 264.7 cells, indicating that it has anti-inflammatory effects. Therefore, we suggest that AKE may be an attractive candidate for promoting skin health.	koreana essential oil bacterial infection
2	Abelmoschus manihot - a traditional Chinese medicine versus losartan potassium for treating IgA nephropathy: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is one of the most common primary glomerular diseases worldwide, but effective therapy remains limited and many patients progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Only angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I)/angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB) show a high level of evidence (1B level) of being of value in the treatment for IgAN according to the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines. However, traditional Chinese medicine has raised attention in kidney disease research. Abelmoschus manihot, a single medicament of traditional Chinese medicine has shown therapeutic effects in primary glomerular disease according to the randomized controlled clinical trial that we have completed. Here, we conduct a new study to assess the efficacy and safety of Abelmoschus manihot in IgAN. Also, this study is currently the largest double-blind, randomized controlled registered clinical research for the treatment of IgAN. METHODS: We will conduct a multicenter, prospective, double-blind, double-dummy randomized controlled study. The study is designed as a noninferiority clinical trial. Approximately 1600 biopsy-proven IgAN patients will be enrolled at 100 centers in China and followed up for as long as 48 weeks. IgAN patients will be randomized assigned to the Abelmoschus manihot group (in the form of a huangkui capsule, 2.5 g, three times per day) and the losartan potassium group (losartan potassium, 100 mg/d). The primary outcome is the change in 24-h proteinuria from baseline after 48 weeks of treatment. Change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from baseline after 48 weeks of treatment, the incidence of endpoint events (proteinuria &gt;=3.5 g/24 h, the doubling of serum creatinine, or receiving blood purification treatment) are the secondary outcomes. Twenty-four-hour proteinuria and eGFR are measured at 0, 4, 12, 24, 36 and 48 weeks. DISCUSSION: This study will be of sufficient size and scope to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Abelmoschus manihot compared to losartan potassium in treating patients with IgAN. The results of this study may provide a new, effective and safe treatment strategy for IgAN. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT02231125 .

1	The Effect of Plant Additives on the Stability of Polyphenols in Dried Black Chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa) Fruit.Chokeberry fruit exhibits a high level of pro-health potential, associated with a significant amount of polyphenol content and antioxidant activity. The fruit is easily perishable and therefore needs to be processed in short order to ensure its availability throughout the year. For this purpose, the fruit is dried, which has an impact on the preservation of bioactive components such as polyphenols. In the study, chokeberry fruit was influenced by a suspension of spices, including clove and cinnamon, and subsequently dried using the freeze-drying, convection, and microwave radiation methods. Freeze-drying was concluded to be the most desirable method of drying, which preserves the largest amount of polyphenols while soaking fruit in a suspension of cinnamon or cloves accelerated the loss of anthocyanins during the storage period. The obtained test results may constitute a valuable source of information for manufacturers in designing new products with increased pro-health potential, whose properties result from the high content of polyphenols and other plant additives.	cloves anthocyanins
2	Cinnamon extract induces tumor cell death through inhibition of NFkappaB and AP1.BACKGROUND: Cinnamomum cassia bark is the outer skin of an evergreen tall tree belonging to the family Lauraceae containing several active components such as essential oils (cinnamic aldehyde and cinnamyl aldehyde), tannin, mucus and carbohydrate. They have various biological functions including anti-oxidant, anti-microbial, anti-inflammation, anti-diabetic and anti-tumor activity. Previously, we have reported that anti-cancer effect of cinnamon extracts is associated with modulation of angiogenesis and effector function of CD8+ T cells. In this study, we further identified that anti-tumor effect of cinnamon extracts is also link with enhanced pro-apoptotic activity by inhibiting the activities NFkappaB and AP1 in mouse melanoma model. METHODS: Water soluble cinnamon extract was obtained and quality of cinnamon extract was evaluated by HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) analysis. In this study, we tested anti-tumor activity and elucidated action mechanism of cinnamon extract using various types of tumor cell lines including lymphoma, melanoma, cervix cancer and colorectal cancer in vitro and in vivo mouse melanoma model. RESULTS: Cinnamon extract strongly inhibited tumor cell proliferation in vitro and induced active cell death of tumor cells by up-regulating pro-apoptotic molecules while inhibiting NFkappaB and AP1 activity and their target genes such as Bcl-2, BcL-xL and survivin. Oral administration of cinnamon extract in melanoma transplantation model significantly inhibited tumor growth with the same mechanism of action observed in vitro. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that anti-tumor effect of cinnamon extracts is directly linked with enhanced pro-apoptotic activity and inhibition of NFkappaB and AP1 activities and their target genes in vitro and in vivo mouse melanoma model. Hence, further elucidation of active components of cinnamon extract could lead to development of potent anti-tumor agent or complementary and alternative medicine for the treatment of diverse cancers.	cinnamomum cassia colorectal cancer
1	Dihydrobenzo[c]phenanthridine alkaloids from stem bark of Zanthoxylum nitidum.Five novel alkaloids, zanthomuurolanine ( 1), epi-zanthomuurolanine ( 2), zanthocadinanines A ( 3) and B ( 4), and epi-zanthocadinanine B ( 5), composed of dihydrochelerythrine and a cadinane-type sesquiterpene linked by a methylene bridge, have been isolated from stem bark of Zanthoxylum nitidum. These structures were elucidated by spectroscopic techniques (UV, IR, MS, CD, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, DEPT, COSY, NOESY, HSQC, and HMBC analyses). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies confirmed the relative configurations of 1 and 4 and provided additional support for the structures of 2, 3, and 5.	zanthoxylum nitidum epi-zanthomuurolanine

The drug increased the survival of the experimental mice infected with TBE virus and prolonged their lifespan. It was shown that 7,3'-disulfate luteolin reduced the virus accumulation in the SPEV cells by 2.0-4.0 lg TChemicalActOnDisease50/ml.	zostera marina tick-borne encephalitis
1	Antisickling properties of divanilloylquinic acids isolated from Fagara zanthoxyloides Lam. (Rutaceae).Fagara zanthoxyloides Lam. (syn. Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides) (Rutaceae) is the most cited Fagara species for the treatment and the prevention of sickle cell disease crisis. Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a public health problem in many countries particularly in Africa. The present study was designed to evaluate the antisickling properties of three isomeric divanilloylquinic acids (3,4-O-divanilloylquinic acid or burkinabin A; 3,5-O-divanilloylquinic acid or burkinabin B and 4,5-O-divanilloylquinic acid or burkinabin C) identified previously by LC/MS/NMR analysis in the root bark of F. zanthoxyloides [Ouattara et al., 2004. LC/MS/NMR analysis of isomeric divanilloylquinic acids from the root bark of Fagara zanthoxyloides Lam. Phytochemistry 65, 1145-1151]. The three isomers showed interesting antisickling properties which increased from burkinabins A to C.	zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides divanilloylquinic acids

Compound 6 is a new compound, and compounds 1-4 were isolated from the plant for the first time.	abrus mollis trigonelline
1	Cinnamaldehyde enhances apoptotic effect of oxaliplatin and reverses epithelial-mesenchymal transition and stemnness in hypoxic colorectal cancer cells.Oxaliplatin has been widely applied in clinical tumor chemotherapy, the treatment failure of which mainly blames on low susceptibility resulted from intrinsic or acquired drug resistance in tumor cells. Microenvironmental hypoxia is one of the important pathological features of solid tumors, which is closely related to the radiochemotherapy tolerance and poor prognosis. Cinnamaldehyde is extracted from Cinnamomum cassia with inhibiting effect against kinds of tumors. In this study, we demonstrated that hypoxia reduced the sensitivity to oxaliplatin in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells via inducing EMT and stemness. Nonetheless, cinnamaldehyde increased the curative effect of oxaliplatin by promoting apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, cinnamaldehyde and oxaliplatin synergistically reversed hypoxia-induced EMT and stemness of CRC cells and suppressed hypoxia-activated Wnt/beta-catenin pathway synergistically. These consequences uncovered the potential therapeutic value of cinnamaldehyde and provided novel ideas on improving the sensitivity of oxaliplatin in CRC therapy.	cinnamomum cassia cinnamaldehyde
1	Rapid determination of amino acids in fruits of Ziziphus jujuba by hydrophilic interaction ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry.In this study, a sensitive and rapid method for the simultaneous determination of free amino acids without derivatization using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS/MS) was developed. The method was performed on an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) separation system coupled with a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry (TQ-MS) instrument. Sufficient separation of 23 underivatized amino acids was achieved on an Acquity BEH Amide column (2.1 mm x 100 mm, 1.7 mum) in a single run of 12 min. Then the method was applied for the analysis of the free amino acids in 46 batches of Ziziphus jujuba fruits which comprised 39 cultivars from 26 cultivation regions. Multivariate statistical analysis was also used to investigate the differences in free amino acid profiles among the samples. This study showed that HILIC-UHPLC-TQ-MS is an effective technique to analyze underivatized amino acids in the food samples. 	ziziphus jujuba beh amide
1	Targets and Mechanism Used by Cinnamaldehyde, the Main Active Ingredient in Cinnamon, in the Treatment of Breast Cancer.Background: Breast cancer has become one of the most common malignant tumors in women owing to its increasing incidence each year. Clinical studies have shown that Cinnamomum cassia (L.) J. Presl (cinnamon) has a positive influence on the prevention and treatment of breast cancer. Aim: We aimed to screen the potential targets of cinnamon in the treatment of breast cancer through network pharmacology and explore its potential therapeutic mechanism through cell experiments. Methods: We used the TCMSP, TCM Database @ Taiwan, and TCMID websites and established the active ingredient and target database of cinnamon. Thereafter, we used the GeneCards and OMIM databases to establish a breast cancer-related target database, which matched the cinnamon target database. Based on the matching results, the STRING database was used to analyze the interaction between the targets, and the biological information annotation database was used to analyze the biological process of the target (gene ontology) and the pathway enrichment of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). After establishing the layout of the analysis, we used Cytoscape 3.6.0 software for network analysis. Finally, the cell experiment was used to verify the anti-breast cancer effect of cinnamaldehyde. Results: Our research showed that the main components of cinnamon, including cinnamaldehyde, can play a role in the treatment of breast cancer through 59 possible important targets. Subsequently, enrichment analysis by gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes showed that 83 cell biological processes and 37 pathways were associated with breast cancer (p < 0.05), including the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor and PI3K-Akt pathway, which are closely related to tumor cell apoptosis. In vitro cell verification experiments showed that cinnamaldehyde can significantly inhibit cell proliferation, change cell morphology, inhibit cell migration and invasion ability, and promote cell apoptosis. Conclusion: Our results showed that cinnamaldehyde is a potential novel drug for the treatment and prevention of breast cancer.	cinnamon cinnamaldehyde
2	Traditional herbal remedies used for the treatment of urinary schistosomiasis in Zimbabwe.A total of 286 traditional healers, 85% of them registered with the Zimbabwe National Traditional Healers' Association (ZINATHA), in five administrative provinces of Zimbabwe, were interviewed to assess their knowledge about the signs and symptoms of urinary schistosomiasis. Information on the names of plants used to treat Schistosoma haematobium infections was solicited. Haematuria was mentioned by 99% of the traditional healers to be the most obvious sign of S. haematobium infection. General body weakness, increased urinary frequency and pain on micturition also were reported to be some of the signs of infection. Eight plant materials were identified as the most commonly used for the treatment of S. haematobium. The plants were identified and parts collected to investigate their antischistosomal properties. The plant materials were prepared according to the guidelines of the traditional healers and their efficacy determined by administering the crude extracts orally to hamsters infected with S. haematobium cercariae. The results obtained suggested that plant extracts from Abrus precatorius (Leguminosae), Pterocarpus angolensis (Leguminosae) and Ozoroa insignis (Anacardiaceae) were lethal to adult schistosomes.	pterocarpus angolensis schistosoma haematobium infections
2	In vitro anti-Helicobacter pylori action of 30 Chinese herbal medicines used to treat ulcer diseases.Infection by Helicobacter pylori has been ascertained to be an important etiologic impetus leading usually to chronic active gastritis and gastric ulcer with growing incidences worldwide. Utilizing as the test pathogen a standard and five clinic strains of Helicobacter pylori, the antibacterial action was assessed in vitro with ethanol extracts of 30 Chinese herbal medicines which have been frequently prescribed since ancient times for treating gastritis-like disorders. Among the 30 tested materials, the ethanol extracts of Abrus cantoniensis (Fabaceae), Saussurea lappa (Asteraceae) and Eugenia caryophyllata (Myrtaceae) were strongly inhibitory to all test strains (MICs: approximately 40 microg/ml), and Hippophae rhamnoides (Elaeagnaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii (Liliaceae), Magnolia officinalis and Schisandra chinensis (Magnoliaceae), Corydalis yanhusuo (Papaveraceae), Citrus reticulata (Rutaceae), Bupleurum chinense and Ligusticum chuanxiong (Apiaceae) substantially active with MICs close to 60.0 microg/ml. As to antibacterial actions of the aqueous extracts of the same drugs, those derived from Cassia obtusifolia (Fabaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii and Eugenia caryophyllata were remarkably inhibitory against all the six Helicobacter pylori strains (MICs: approximately 60 microg/ml). The work compared almost quantitatively the magnitude of the anti-Helicobacter pylori actions of the 30 most prescribed gastritis-treating Chinese herbal drugs, and located as well some source plants where potent anti-Helicobacter pylori phytochemicals could be characterized.	abrus cantoniensis gastric ulcer
3	Anti-gastric actions of eugenol and cinnamic acid isolated from Cinnamomi Ramulus.We investigated the evidence of gastric protection for ulcer and gastritis by Cinnamomi Ramulus (Cinnamomum cassia Blume, Geiji, CR) extract and its several constituents. CR ethanolic extract showed the potent antioxidant activity and cytotoxicity of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and acid-neutralizing capacity. Especially, eugenol exerted a significant antioxidant activity and inhibited the colonization of H. pylori. In vivo test, eugenol and cinnamic acid significantly inhibited HCl/ethanol-induced gastric lesions and increased the mucus content though they didn't inhibit gastric secretion effectively. Taken together, eugenol and cinnamic acid, which were isolated from CR, exhibited the antioxidant activity in vitro and protective effect against gastric damage in vivo through stimulation of mucus secretion and so on. It suggested that they are useful as the neutraceuticals for gastritis.	eugenol gastritis
1	Production of Abrus pulchellus ribosome-inactivating protein from seeds callus culture.Ribosome inactivating proteins (RIPs) were isolated from callus culture that were established from seed explants of Abrus pulchellus. Cotyledon segments of immature seeds were inoculated in basal medium MS supplemented with different concentrations of auxin (2,4-D), citokinin (kinetin and BA) and sucrose in order to determine the best callus induction. A. pulchellus type 2 RIP (pulchellin) expression was monitored in callus cultures by RT-PCR and biological activity. The calli obtained after 35 days were freeze dried, macerated and submitted to extraction of total RNA and proteins (0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.6 buffer, containing 0.15 M NaCl, 3 h at room temperature). A specific DNA fragment codifying the A-chain pulchellin was amplified from callus RNA suggesting the presence of the protein. This was confirmed in the calli crude extract that showed haemagglutinating activity against rabbit blood cells and a high intraperitoneal toxicity to mice. The crude extract was also submitted to affinity chromatography on a Sepharose-4B column. The retained protein, peak released by 0.1 M galactose, appeared to be composed of two main bands in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, in denaturating conditions, with a similar pattern to that obtained with seeds.	c. aromaticum trans-cinnamaldehyde
1	Protective effects of 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde an active ingredients of Cinnamomum cassia on warm hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury in rat model.Objectives: Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) is one of the major causes of hepatic failure during liver transplantation, trauma, and infections. The present study investigated the protective effect of intra-portal administration of 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde (2-MCA) on hepatic IRI in rats. Materials and Methods: Twenty-four rats were equally divided into four groups; 1) sham group, (no IRI or transfusion), 2) Hepatic IRI (60 min ischemia + 120 min reperfusion, 3) Hepatic IRI+ NS (IRI + normal saline), 4) Hepatic IRI+2-MCA, (IRI + 2-MCA). In groups 3 and 4, 1 ml/kg normal saline and 2-MCA were administered slowly into the vein of the left lateral and median lobes of the liver 10 min before induction of hepatic reperfusion (upper the site of clumping), respectively. The harvest time points were at 2 hours post-reperfusion in all groups. Results: Histologically, cell death, degenerative changes, sinusoidal dilatation, congestion, hemorrhage, and infiltration of inflammatory cells were observed in IRI group, while these pathological changes were attenuated in the 2-MCA administrated group. The level of alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, tumor necrosis factor- alpha and interleukin-6 in serum and hepatic malondialdehyde were significantly increased by IRI, and 2-MCA administration reduced all these markers. In addition, caspase-3 and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) expression were investigated immunohistochemically. Administration of 2-MCA considerably decreased caspase-3 positive cells and NF-kappaB activity in comparison with IRI group. Conclusion: As a conclusion, in situ administration of 2-MCA protects against hepatic IRI via anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties.	cinnamomum cassia 2-MCA
2	Review: Diverse pharmacological properties of Cinnamomum cassia: A review.Cinnamomum cassia is widely utilized as a spice in different cookeries worldwide, especially in Asian cuisines. This herb is also being used in different forms of traditional medicine (Unani, Ayurvedic, Japanese and Chinese) for managing conditions like dyspepsia, peptic ulcer disease and ischemic brain injury. Recent studies have shown the scientific evidence for the medicinal use of this particular herb in several diseases like H. pylori infection, diabetes, brain ischemia and cancers. This article reviews the literature on potential benefits of the herb published within the last 10 years. The authors used Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms "Cinnamomum" with "cassia" or "arromaticum" to filter the PubMed database. To date, no systemic review focusing on medicinal use of C. cassia was found in the literature. Various research articles elucidating diverse pharmacological properties of C. cassia were identified. The standardised extract of C. cassia or the active compounds extracted from the herb might prove to be a novel candidate for early prevention and complimentary management of conditions like diabetes mellitus or H. pylori-associated disorders. 	c. cassia cancers
1	Aroma constituents and alkylamides of red and green huajiao (Zanthoxylum bungeanum and Zanthoxylum schinifolium).Huajiao denotes the fruits of various species of Zanthoxylum in the plant family Rutaceare used for cooking. The two most commercially popular species are bungeanum (red huajiao) and schinifolium (green huajiao). Fresh huajiao has a very high content of essential oil, up to 11%, which is described as having fresh, spicy, floral, cooling, and green aroma notes. A comprehensive analysis of the essential oils by GC-MS using advanced peak deconvolution and data processing software, revealed many overlapping components. A total of 120 aroma compounds for each species has been found. In the essential oils, linalyl acetate (15%), linalool (13%), and limonene (12%) are the major components of red huajiao, whereas linalool (29%), limonene (14%), and sabinene (13%) are the major components of green huajiao. For estimation of the aroma contribution of individual components, a new concept, "aroma character impact value" (ACI), is introduced as the percentage of the ratio of the concentration of an aroma component to its odor threshold value. Despite the differences in major components, both species have six common compounds of top aroma character impact: linalool, alpha-terpineol, myrcene, 1,8-cineole, limonene, and geraniol. The tingling sensation of huajiao is caused mainly by the alkylamide hydroxy-alpha-sanshool. The tingling compound decomposes easily under hydrolytic conditions or under UV light.

2	Influence of Binasal and Uninasal Inhalations of Essential Oil of Abies koreana Twigs on Electroencephalographic Activity of Human.Objectives. The present work investigates the effect of essential oil from the twigs of Abies koreana on electroencephalographic (EEG) activity of human brain in order to understand the influence of binasal and uninasal inhalations. Methods. To accomplish this study, the essential oil from the twigs of A. koreana (AEO) was isolated by steam distillation and the EEG readings were recorded using QEEG-8 system from 8 grounding electrodes according to the International 10-20 System. Results. D-Limonene (25.29%), bornyl acetate (19.31%), camphene (12.48%), alpha-pinene (11.88%), beta-pinene (6.45%), and eudesm-7(11)-en-ol (5.38%) were the major components in the essential oil. In the EEG study, the absolute alpha (left frontal and right parietal) and absolute fast alpha (right parietal) values significantly increased during the binasal inhalation of AEO. In the uninasal inhalation, absolute beta and theta values decreased significantly, especially in the right frontal and left and right parietal regions. The results revealed that the AEO produced different EEG power spectrum changes according to the nostril difference. Conclusion. The changes in EEG values due to the inhalation of AEO may contribute to the enhancement of relaxation (binasal inhalation) and alertness/attention (right uninasal inhalation) states of brain which could be used in aromatherapy treatments.	a. koreana alertness
1	Antitrypanosomal isoflavan quinones from Abrus precatorius.Human African trypanosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease in sub Saharan Africa that is fatal if left untreated. In a search for new natural products with antitrypanosomal activity, we recently identified abruquinones B and I from Abrus precatorius as potent in vitro trypanocidal compounds with high selectivity indices. To obtain sufficient compound for in vivo efficacy tests in mice, a second batch of plant material was re-collected and extracted. However, the chemical profiles of the two batches differed, and additional abruquinones were isolated and identified by HR-ESI-MS, and 1D and 2D NMR ((1)H, (13)C, COSY, HMBC, HSQC, and NOESY) spectroscopy. Abruquinones J (1), K (2), and L (3) were new, while abruquinones A (4) and D (5) were known from the first batch of plant material. The absolute configuration of compounds 1 to 3 was determined by comparison of electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra with calculated ECD data. Compounds 2 to 5 showed high in vitro activity against T. b. rhodesiense (IC50 of 0.01, 0.02, 0.02 and 0.01 muM, respectively), and remarkable SIs of 508, 374, 1379, and 668, respectively.	abrus precatorius abruquinones a
1	Pharmacokinetics of daikenchuto, a traditional Japanese medicine (kampo) after single oral administration to healthy Japanese volunteers.The pharmacokinetics of daikenchuto (TJ-100), a pharmaceutical-grade traditional Japanese medicine, were investigated in healthy Japanese volunteers after a single oral administration of 2.5-, 5-, and 10-g doses. Six ingredients [hydroxy-alpha-sanshool (HAS), hydroxy-beta-sanshool (HBS), [6]-shogaol (6S), [10]-shogaol (10S), ginsenoside Rb1(GRB1), and ginsenoside Rg1(GRG1)] of TJ-100 were determined by using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The results indicated that HAS, an ingredient derived from Zanthoxylum piperitum fruit, exhibited the highest plasma concentration among the six ingredients investigated. The plasma concentrations of HAS, HBS, 6S, and 10S reached the maximum concentration (approximately 400, 80, 0.14, and 0.6 ng/ml, respectively, after a 5-g administration of TJ-100) within 30 min after administration, and the mean half-life was approximately 2 h. Thus, these compounds were rapidly absorbed and eliminated. The plasma concentration of GRB1 reached the maximum concentration (2 ng/ml after a 5-g administration of TJ-100) at approximately 4 h after administration and the half-life of GRB1 was approximately 40 h. The plasma concentration of GRG1 was extremely low (&lt;0.023 ng/ml). The pharmacokinetics of HAS, HBS, 6S, and 10S, were linear within the range of 2.5 to 10 g/day of TJ-100. On the other hand, the kinetics of GRB1 and GRG1 were not proportional to dosage, and plateauing was observed.	zanthoxylum piperitum ginsenoside rb1
2	The effect of medicinal plants of Islamabad and Murree region of Pakistan on insulin secretion from INS-1 cells.In vitro testing of the extracts of medicinal plants collected from Islamabad and the Murree region on insulin secretagogue activity was carried out. Dried ethanol extracts of all plants (ZH1-ZH19) were dissolved in ethanol and DMSO, and tested at various concentrations (between 1 and 40 microg/mL) for insulin release from INS-1 cells in the presence of 5.5 mM glucose. Glibenclamide was used as a control. Promising insulin secretagogue activity in various plant extracts at 1, 10, 20 and 40 microg/mL was found, while in some cases a decrease in insulin secretion was also observed. Artemisia roxburghiana, Salvia coccinia and Monstera deliciosa showed insulin secretagogue activity at 1 microg/mL (p &lt; 0.05) while Abies pindrow, Centaurea iberica and Euphorbia helioscopia were active at 10 microg/mL (p &lt; 0.05). Extracts of Bauhinia variegata and Bergenia himalacia showed effects at 20 microg/mL (p &lt; 0.05), and Taraxacum officinale and Viburnum foetens at 40 microg/mL (p &lt; 0.05). Insulin secretagogue activity could not be detected in the extracts of Adhatoda vasica, Cassia fistula, Chrysanthemum leucanthemum, Morus alba, Plectranthus rugosus, Peganum harmala and Olea ferruginea. The results suggest that medicinal plants of Islamabad and the Murree region of Pakistan may be potential natural resources for antidiabetic compounds.	taraxacum officinale insulin secretion
1	[GC-MS analysis and cytotoxic activity of the supercritical extracts from roots and stems of Zanthoxylum nitidum].The volatile components of roots and stems of Zanthoxylum nitidum were investigated by supercritical fluid carbon dioxide extraction (SFE-CO2) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry(GC-MS). Thirty-one and fifty-one compounds were identified in the supercritical extracts from roots and stems of Z. nitidum, respectively, and total twenty-seven compounds were the common constituents. Among them, the major constituents in root and stem supercritical extracts were spathulenol (18.49 and 26.18%), n-hexadecanoic acid (14.24% and 12.79%), ar-tumerone (6.95% and 8.88%), oleic acid (8.39% and 5.71%) and hexanoic acid (4.39% and 7.78%). The in-vitro MTT assay showed that the volatile components of roots and stems of Z. nitidum did not exhibited any cytotoxic activity against human cancer Huh-7 and normal IEC-6 cells. These results indicated the same nature of the volatile constituents in the root and stem of Z. nitidum. This investigation may provide further evidence for expansion of medicinal parts of Z. nitidum.	z. nitidum oleic acid
1	Invasion inhibitors of human fibrosarcoma HT 1080 cells from the rhizomes of Zingiber cassumunar: structures of phenylbutanoids, cassumunols.The methanolic extract and its EtOAc-soluble fraction from the rhizomes of Zingiber cassumunar inhibited invasion of human fibrosarcoma HT 1080 cells. From the EtOAc-soluble fraction, eight new phenylbutanoids, cassumunols A-H, were isolated together with 30 known constituents. The structures of new phenylbutanoids were elucidated on the basis of chemical and physicochemical evidence. Principal constituents were examined the inhibitory effects on the invasion of HT 1080 cells. Among them, phlain I and III, (E)-1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)buta-1,3-diene, (E)-1-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)buta-1,3-diene, and (-)-beta-sesquiphellandrene showed anti-invasion effects. Interestingly, (E)-1-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)buta-1,3-diene [inhibition (%) 46.8 +- 7.2 (p&lt;0.05) at 30 microM] significantly inhibited the invasion, and only a weak cytotoxic effect was observed.	zingiber cassumunar cassumunols
1	Topical antiinflammatory activity of the major lipophilic constituents of the rhizome of Zingiber cassumunar. Part I: The essential oil.The essential oil of the rhizome of Zingiber cassumunar was found to exhibit a topical antiinflammatory effect, when tested using the model of carrageenan-induced hind paw edema in rats (ID(50) = 22 mg oil/paw). Individual assessment of topical antiinflammatory activity of the five major components of the oil demonstrated that (E)-1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)butadiene (DMPBD), terpinen-4-ol and alpha-terpinene significantly inhibited edema formation, whereas sabinene and gamma-terpinene were inactive up to 6 mg/paw. The most active compound, DMPBD, was found to be an antiinflammatory agent twice as potent as the reference drug diclofenac (ID(50) = 3 vs 6 mg/paw, respectively).	zingiber cassumunar gamma-terpinene
1	Foliar and cortex oleoresin variability of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) in Albania.Terpene composition of needle and cortical oleoresin from lateral shoots were analyzed by GC/MS for four Silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) populations scattered in natural species range in Albania. More than sixty compounds were detected in the needle oleoresin, which was characterized by a high content of alpha-pinene, camphene, beta-pinene, limonene and bornyl acetate. Three monoterpenes, alpha-pinene, beta-pinene and limonene, and two sesquiterpenes, beta-caryophyllene and germacrene D, comprised the majority of cortical oleoresin. The terpene composition differences among the populations that led to the recognition of two chemotypes. The needle oleoresin from the provinces of Puka, Bulqiza and Llogara were characterised by high amounts of beta-pinene, camphene and alpha-pinene and low amounts of limonene, while that from Drenova had high amounts of beta-pinene and limonene. A similar pattern was found in the cortical oleoresin with the exception of camphene that was a minor contributor. Geographical and seasonal variation between the populations was, also, investigated. Multivariate analysis of both needle and cortical oleoresin separated Drenova (southeastern population) from the other sites. When both major monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes were considered four chemical profiles could be attributed. Based on their chemical profiles, the populations can be divided into two groups: Populations with high content of beta-pinene and alpha-pinene but a low content of limonene (Puka, Bulqiza and Llogara), typical of most of A. alba populations in all its distribution range. Population with a high content of limonene and a moderate content of beta-pinene and alpha-pinene (Drenova).	a. alba beta-pinene
2	Quantitative Evaluation of the Compatibility Effects of Huangqin Decoction on the Treatment of Irinotecan-Induced Gastrointestinal Toxicity Using Untargeted Metabolomics.Huangqin decoction (HQD), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), has been widely used to treat gastrointestinal syndrome in China for thousands of years. Chemotherapy drug irinotecan (CPT-11) is used clinically to treat various kinds of cancers but limited by its side effects, especially delayed diarrhea. Nowadays, HQD has been proved to be effective in attenuating the intestinal toxicity induced by CPT-11. HQD consists of four medicinal herbs including Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Ziziphus jujuba Mill. Due to its complexity, the role of each herb and the multi-herb synergistic effects of the formula are poorly understood. In order to quantitatively assess the compatibility effects of HQD, mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics studies were performed. The serum metabolic profiles of rats administered with HQD, single S. baicalensis decoction, S. baicalensis-free decoction and baicalin/baicalein combination were compared. A time-dependent trajectory upon principal component analysis was firstly used to visualize the overall differences. Then metabolites deregulation score and relative area under the curve were calculated and used as parameters to quantitatively evaluate the compatibility effects of HQD from the aspect of global metabolic profile and the specifically altered metabolites, respectively. The collective results indicated that S. baicalensis played a crucial role in the therapeutic effect of HQD on irinotecan-induced diarrhea. Both HQD and SS decoction regulated glycine, serine and threonine pathway. This study demonstrated that metabolomics was a promising tool to elucidate the compatibility effects of TCM or combinatorial drugs.	s. baicalensis gastrointestinal syndrome
1	Antiproliferative Activity of Cinnamomum cassia Constituents and Effects of Pifithrin-Alpha on Their Apoptotic Signaling Pathways in Hep G2 Cells.Cinnamaldehyde (Cin), cinnamic acid (Ca) and cinnamyl alcohol (Cal), major constituents of Cinnamomum cassia, have been shown to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer and other activities. In this study, our aim was to evaluate the antiproliferative activity of these compounds in human hepatoma Hep G2 cells and examine the effects of pifithrin-alpha (PFTalpha; a specific p53 inhibitor) on their apoptotic signaling transduction mechanism. The antiproliferative activity was measured by XTT assay. Expression of apoptosis-related proteins was detected by western blotting. Results showed that at a concentration of 30 muM, the order of antiproliferative activity in Hep G2 cells was Cin &gt; Ca &gt; Cal. Cin (IC(50) 9.76 +- 0.67 muM) demonstrated an antiproliferative potency as good as 5-fluorouracil (an anti-cancer drug; IC(50) 9.57 +- 0.61 muM). Further studies on apoptotic mechanisms of Cin showed that it downregulated the expression of Bcl-(XL), upregulated CD95 (APO-1), p53 and Bax proteins, as well as cleaving the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in a time-dependent pattern. PFTalpha pre-incubation significantly diminished the effect of Cin-induced apoptosis. It markedly upregulated the anti-apoptotic (Bcl-(XL)) expression and downregulated the pro-apoptotic (Bax) expression, as well as effectively blocking the CD95 (APO-1) and p53 expression, and PARP cleavage in Cin-treated cells. This study indicates that Cin was the most potent antiproliferative constituent of C. cassia, and its apoptotic mechanism in Hep G2 cells could be mediated through the p53 induction and CD95 (APO-1) signaling pathways.	c. cassia Cin
2	Zanthoxylum usambarense (Engl.) Kokwaro (Rutaceae) extracts inhibit the growth of the breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, but not the brain tumour cell line U251 in vitro.Zanthoxylum usambarense (Engl.) Kokwaro has traditionally been used for the treatment of malaria, upper respiratory tract infections, cough, rheumatism, tooth decay and sore gums in Kenya and other African countries. Dried ground parts of Z. usambarense were extracted by maceration using methanol (MeOH) at room temperature, extract was dried and reconstituted in 70% aq. MeOH and partitioned against n-hexane and chloroform (CHCl3 ) to obtain MeOH, n-hexane and CHCl3 extracts. All extracts were assessed for cytotoxicity against two breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, and the brain tumour cell line U251 by the MTT assay. The free-radical scavenging activity of the extracts was also determined by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryhydrazyl (DPPH) assay. In the DPPH assay, the MeOH extract was found to be the most active free-radical scavenger with a RC50 value of 41.1 x 10(-3)  mg/mL. It also displayed significant cytotoxicity against the MCF-7 cell line (IC50 42.9 microg/mL) and appeared to have induced cell death through apoptosis. None of the test extracts showed any activity against the U251 cell line at test concentrations. The present findings demonstrated that Z. usambarense could be a potential source for new cytotoxic compounds for possible anticancer drug development.	z. usambarense rheumatism
0	Cinnamaldehyde suppresses NLRP3 derived IL-1beta via activating succinate/HIF-1 in rheumatoid arthritis rats.Cinnamaldehyde (CA) is an essential component of cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia Presland), which is often used as a flavoring condiment in beverages, pastries, perfumes, etc. Cinnamon is also used as herbal medicine in China and Southeast Asia to treat rheumatoid arthritis. However, the molecular mechanism is unclear. In this study, we aim to investigate its anti-inflammatory effects against Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using activated macrophages (Raw246.7) in vitro and adjuvant arthritis rats (AA) in vivo. The results demonstrated that CA significantly reduced synovial inflammation in AA rats, possibly due to suppression of the expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially the IL-1beta. Further investigation found that CA also suppressed the activity of HIF-1alpha by inhibiting the accumulation of succinate in cytoplasm. As we know, the reduction of HIF-1alpha nucleation slows down IL-1beta production, because HIF-1alpha activates the expression of NLRP3, which is involved in the assembly of inflammasome and processing of IL-1beta. In addition, CA also inhibited the expression of the succinate receptor GPR91, which in turn inhibited the activation of HIF-1alpha. In conclusions, our results suggested that CA might be a potential therapeutic compound to relieve rheumatoid arthritis progress by suppressing IL-1beta through modulating succinate/HIF-1alpha axis and inhibition of NLRP3.

1	Effects of selected plant essential oils on the growth and development of mouse preimplantation embryos in vivo.Plant essential oils (EOs) have been reported to have health benefit properties and their preventive and therapeutic use in animals is expected to increase in the future. We evaluated the influence of five essential oils obtained from plant species which are known to have positive antimicrobial, antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects--sage EO from Salvia officinalis L. (Lamiaceae), oregano EO from Origanum vulgare L. (Lamiaceae), thyme EO from Thymus vulgaris L. (Lamiaceae), clove EO from Syzygium aromaticum L. (Myrtaceae) and cinnamon EO from Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume (Lauraceae) on the growth and development of mouse preimplantation embryos in vivo. Essential oils were added to commercial diet at concentrations of 0.25% for sage EO, thyme EO, clove EO, cinnamon EO and 0.1% for oregano EO, and fed to ICR female mice for 2 weeks ad libitum. Females were then mated with males of the same strain. Embryos obtained on Day 4 of pregnancy at the blastocyst stage were stained by morphological triple staining (Hoechst, PI, Calcein-AM) and evaluated using fluorescent microscopy. The effects of essential oils were estimated by the viability of embryos, number of nuclei and distribution of embryos according to nucleus number. Cinnamon EO significantly decreased the number of nuclei and the distribution of embryos according to nucleus number was significantly altered. Sage EO negatively influenced the distribution of embryos according to nucleus number. Clove and oregano EOs induced a significantly increased rate of cell death. Only thyme EO had no detectable effects on embryo development. In conclusion, none of the essential oils had any positive effect on embryo development, but some of them reduced the number of cells and increased the incidence of cell death.	Clove essential oils
1	[Effect of flavonoids from Abelmoschus manihot on proliferation, differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocyte and insulin resistance].Abelmoschus manihot was rich in flavonoids, which has been reported the activity on protecting angiocarpy and improving renal function. This study aimed to explore the action mechanism of five flavonoids from A. manihot on how to ameliorating insulin resistance through the regulation of the glucose and expression of PPARgamma, C/EBPalpha, SREBP-1, resistin, visfatin, adiponectin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. After the 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were differentiated into mature adipocytes, insulin resistance model was built. Insulin resistance adipocytes were treated with 5, 100 mumol L-1 quercetin, isoquercitrin, hyperoside, quercitrin-3'-O-glucoside, gossypetin-8-O-beta-glucoside. The glucose was indirectly determined by BCA kit. The mRNA expression levels of PPARgamma, C/EBPalpha, SREBP-1, resistin, visfatin, adiponectin were detected by real-time quantitative PCR. Results showed that five flavonoids at 5 mumol L-1 could accelerate preadipocytes proliferation and inhibit that at 100 mumol L-1 Compared with the normal group, glucose uptake reduced significantly in model group (P&lt;0.01). With the treatment of five flavonoids at 100 mumol L-1, glucose consumption increased significantly (P&lt;0.01). The high expression of PPARgamma, C/EBPalpha, adiponectin expression was significantly increased (P&lt;0.01), and low expression of SREBP-1, resistin, visfatin after respective administration with five flavonoids at 100 mumol L-1 promoted adipocyte differentiation. This study showed that, HY, JY, QT, QG, GG can control preadipocytes proliferation, promote adipocyte differentiation and regulate the expression of relative factors with lipid metabolism, such as PPARgamma, C/EBPalpha, SREBP-1, adiponectin, resistin, visfatin, increasing glucose utilization and improving insulin resistance in 3T3-L1 adipocyte.	a. manihot isoquercitrin
3	[Antiatherogenic effect of Huajiao volatile oil on experimental atherosclerosis in guinea pigs].OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antiatherogenic effect of Chinese medicine Huajiao volatile oil and its possible mechanisms. METHODS: Atherosclerotic guinea pig models were duplicated by feeding high lipid forage. Thirty-six guinea pigs were randomly divided into three groups: control group, model group and Huajiao volatile oil group. Common forage (control group), high lipid forage (model group) and high lipid forage adding Huajiao volatile oil 10 mg/kg (Huajiao volatile oil group) were given to each group accordingly. After fourteen weeks, all animals were killed for the determination of the serum lipids, apolipoproteins, malonyldialdehyde (MDA), hepatic and aortic cholesterol and triglyceride concentration, and the percentage of aortic lesions covering the intimal surface. RESULTS: At the end of the 14th week, the serum lipids of model group and Huajiao volatile oil group were significantly higher than those of control group. The serum LDL level, LDL/HDL ratio, ApoB and MDA in the Huajiao volatile oil group were significantly reduced, compared with those in model group. The hepatic and aortic cholesterol and triglyceride concentration and aorta plaque area percentage of Huajiao volatile oil group were significantly lower than those of model group. CONCLUSION: Huajiao volatile oil has an inhibitory effect on the development of experimental atherosclerosis lesions in guinea pigs. The mechanism may be related to regulation of lipid metabolism and antioxidation of serum lipids.	huajiao volatile oil atherosclerosis lesions

3	Biological activities of nitidine, a potential anti-malarial lead compound.BACKGROUND: Nitidine is thought to be the main active ingredient in several traditional anti-malarial remedies used in different parts of the world. The widespread use of these therapies stresses the importance of studying this molecule in the context of malaria control. However, little is known about its potential as an anti-plasmodial drug, as well as its mechanism of action. METHODS: In this study, the anti-malarial potential of nitidine was evaluated in vitro on CQ-sensitive and -resistant strains. The nitidine's selectivity index compared with cancerous and non-cancerous cell lines was then determined. In vivo assays were then performed, using the four-day Peter's test methodology. To gain information about nitidine's possible mode of action, its moment of action on the parasite cell cycle was studied, and its localization inside the parasite was determined using confocal microscopy. The in vitro abilities of nitidine to bind haem and to inhibit beta-haematin formation were also demonstrated. RESULTS: Nitidine showed similar in vitro activity in CQ-sensitive and resistant strains, and also a satisfying selectivity index (&gt; 10) when compared with a non-cancerous cells line. Its in vivo activity was moderate; however, no sign of acute toxicity was observed during treatment. Nitidine's moment of action on the parasite cycle showed that it could not interfere with DNA replication; this was consistent with the observation that nitidine did not localize in the nucleus, but rather in the cytoplasm of the parasite. Nitidine was able to form a 1-1 complex with haem in vitro and also inhibited beta-haematin formation with the same potency as chloroquine. CONCLUSION: Nitidine can be considered a potential anti-malarial lead compound. Its ability to complex haem and inhibit beta-haematin formation suggests a mechanism of action similar to that of chloroquine. The anti-malarial activity of nitidine could therefore be improved by structural modification of this molecule to increase its penetration of the digestive vacuole in the parasite, where haemoglobin metabolization takes place.	nitidine malaria

The new structures of 1-6 were determined by using detailed spectroscopic analysis. All of the isolated compounds were examined for their inhibitory effects against rat joint synovial cell and splenocyte proliferation. Compounds 1-6 showed potent anti-inflammatory activities with IC50 values ranging from 18.6 to 36.1muM, and 13.8 to 74.3muM. 	zanthoxylum simulans zanthpodocarpins c-h
1	Antiviral effect of flavonol glycosides isolated from the leaf of Zanthoxylum piperitum on influenza virus.The ethanol extract of Zanthoxylum piperitum (L.) DC. showed in vitro antiviral activity against influenza A virus. Three flavonol glycosides were isolated from the EtOAc fraction of Z. piperitum leaf by means of activity-guided chromatographic separation. Structures of isolated compounds were identified as quercetin 3-O-beta-D-galactopyranoside (1), quercetin 3-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside (2), kaempferol 3-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside (3) by comparing their spectral data with literature values. The anti-influenza viral activity of isolates was evaluated using a plaque reduction assay against influenza A/NWS/33 (H1N1) virus. The compounds also were subjected to neuraminidase inhibition assay in influenza A/NWS/33 virus. Compounds 1-3 exhibited antiviral activity against an influenza A virus in vitro, and inhibited the neuraminidase activity at relatively high concentrations. 	z. piperitum quercetin 3-o-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside
1	Antioxidant activity of various parts of Cinnamomum cassia extracted with different extraction methods.The aim of this study was to investigate the antioxidant activities of various parts (barks, buds, and leaves) of Cinnamomum cassia extracted with ethanol and supercritical fluid extraction (SFE). For the antioxidant activity comparison, IC50 values of the SFE and ethanol extracts in the DPPH scavenging assay were 0.562-10.090 mg/mL and 0.072-0.208 mg/mL, and the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) values were 6.789-58.335 mmole Trolox/g and 133.039-335.779 mmole Trolox/g, respectively. In addition, the total flavonoid contents were 0.031-1.916 g/ 100 g dry weight of materials (DW) and 2.030-3.348 g/ 100 g DW, and the total phenolic contents were 0.151-2.018 g/ 100 g DW and 6.313-9.534 g/ 100 g DW in the SFE and ethanol extracts, respectively. Based on the results, the ethanol extracts of Cinnamon barks have potential value as an antioxidant substitute and this study also provide a better technique to extract the natural antioxidant substances from C. cassia.	c. cassia flavonoid
2	Production of Abrus pulchellus ribosome-inactivating protein from seeds callus culture.Ribosome inactivating proteins (RIPs) were isolated from callus culture that were established from seed explants of Abrus pulchellus. Cotyledon segments of immature seeds were inoculated in basal medium MS supplemented with different concentrations of auxin (2,4-D), citokinin (kinetin and BA) and sucrose in order to determine the best callus induction. A. pulchellus type 2 RIP (pulchellin) expression was monitored in callus cultures by RT-PCR and biological activity. The calli obtained after 35 days were freeze dried, macerated and submitted to extraction of total RNA and proteins (0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.6 buffer, containing 0.15 M NaCl, 3 h at room temperature). A specific DNA fragment codifying the A-chain pulchellin was amplified from callus RNA suggesting the presence of the protein. This was confirmed in the calli crude extract that showed haemagglutinating activity against rabbit blood cells and a high intraperitoneal toxicity to mice. The crude extract was also submitted to affinity chromatography on a Sepharose-4B column. The retained protein, peak released by 0.1 M galactose, appeared to be composed of two main bands in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, in denaturating conditions, with a similar pattern to that obtained with seeds.	a. pulchellus toxicity
2	Evaluation of the antioxidant effects of Ziziphus mauritiana Lam. Leaf extracts against chronic ethanol-induced hepatotoxicity in rat liver.Chronic alcohol ingestion is known to increase the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby leading to liver damage. Antioxidant enzymes act individually or in combination to reduce or counter the effect of these ROS. Chronic administration of alcohol at (40% v/v, 1 ml/100 g), for 6 weeks showed a significant (p&lt;0.05) elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bilirubin (TB). There was also a significant (p&lt;0.05) decreased levels of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and superoxide dismutase compared to control rats. Pre-treatment of rats with 200, 400 mg/kg body weight of aqueous leaf extract of Ziziphus mauritiana or 100 mg/kg silymarin resulted in a significant (p&lt;0.05) decreased levels of ALT, AST, ALP, and TB with levels of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and superoxide dismutase showing a significant (p&lt;0.05) increase compared to group administered alcohol only. Histopathology of rat liver administered with alcohol only resulted in severe necrosis, mononuclear cell aggregation and fatty degeneration in the central and mid zonal areas which was a characteristic of a damaged liver. Pre-treatment with the aqueous extract of Ziziphus mauritiana or silymarin reduced the morphological changes that are associated with chronic alcohol administration. The presence of tannins, saponins and phenolic compounds observed in the plant extract could be responsible for the observed effects of decreasing the levels of injured tissue marker and lipid peroxidation.	ziziphus mauritiana liver damage
1	Essential Oils, Silver Nanoparticles and Propolis as Alternative Agents Against Fluconazole Resistant Candida albicans, Candida glabrata and Candida krusei Clinical Isolates.Development of effective and safe therapeutic treatment of fungal infections remains one of the major challenge for modern medicine. The aim of presented investigation was to analyze the in vitro antifungal activity of selected essential oils, ethanolic extracts of propolis and silver nanoparticles dropped on TiO2 against azole-resistant C. albicans (n = 20), C. glabrata (n = 14) and C. krusei (n = 10) clinical isolates. Among tested essential oils, the highest activity has definitely been found in the case of the oil isolated from the bark of Cinnamomum cassia, with MIC and MFC values for all tested strains in the range of 0.0006-0.0097 % (v/v) and 0.0012-0.019 % (v/v), respectively. High activity was also observed for the Lemon, Basil, Thyme, Geranium and Clove (from buds) essential oils. Significant differences in fungicidal activity have been observed in the case of four tested propolis samples. Only one of them revealed high activity, with MFC values in the range from 0.156 to 1.25 % (v/v). Satisfactory fungicidal activity, against C. albicans and C. glabrata isolates, was also observed in the case of silver nanoparticles, however C. krusei isolates were mostly resistant. We also revealed that constituents of most of essential oils and propolis as well as silver nanoparticles are not substrates for drug transporters, which belong to the most important factors affecting resistance of Candida spp. clinical isolates to many of conventional antimycotics. To conclude, the results of our investigation revealed that essential oils, propolis and silver nanoparticles represent high potential for controlling and prevention candidiasis. 	c. krusei essential oils
1	Anti-gastric actions of eugenol and cinnamic acid isolated from Cinnamomi Ramulus.We investigated the evidence of gastric protection for ulcer and gastritis by Cinnamomi Ramulus (Cinnamomum cassia Blume, Geiji, CR) extract and its several constituents. CR ethanolic extract showed the potent antioxidant activity and cytotoxicity of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and acid-neutralizing capacity. Especially, eugenol exerted a significant antioxidant activity and inhibited the colonization of H. pylori. In vivo test, eugenol and cinnamic acid significantly inhibited HCl/ethanol-induced gastric lesions and increased the mucus content though they didn't inhibit gastric secretion effectively. Taken together, eugenol and cinnamic acid, which were isolated from CR, exhibited the antioxidant activity in vitro and protective effect against gastric damage in vivo through stimulation of mucus secretion and so on. It suggested that they are useful as the neutraceuticals for gastritis.	cinnamomum cassia eugenol
2	Anti-diabetic nephropathy compounds from Cinnamomum cassia.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The bark of Cinnamomum cassia, called 'Rou-Gui', a traditional spice and medicine in China, is used to treat diseases resulted from kidney yang deficiency, including diabetic nephropathy. The aim of this study is to investigate the anti-diabetic nephropathy activity of Rou-Gui and the active compounds in it. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The air-dried bark of C. cassia was extracted with 90% EtOH, the obtained residue was successively partitioned by petroleum ether, EtOAc, and n-BuOH followed by concentrating to give petroleum ether (RG-1), EtOAc (RG-2), n-BuOH (RG-3), and water fraction (RG-4), respectively. The anti-diabetic nephropathy activity of fraction (RG-1-4) was evaluated in vitro by inhibiting the expression of fibronectin, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and interleukin-6 in high-glucose-induced mesangial cells. By bioassay screenings, repeated column chromatography on fractions of RG-1, 2, and 3, led to the isolation of 23 compounds, whose structures were determined by extensive spectroscopic analyses, and the anti-diabetic nephropathy activity of the isolated compounds was also evaluated. RESULTS: Four new sesquiterpenoids, cinnamoids A-D (1-4), a new natural product (5), and 18 known compounds (6-23) were isolated from the EtOH extract of the bark of C. cassia under the bioassay-guided screenings. The anti-diabetic nephropathy activity assay showed that fractions of RG-1, 2, and 3 could significantly inhibit the production of fibronectin, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and interleukin-6 in high-glucose-stimulated mesangial cells at the concentration of 50 mug/ml; and sesquiterpenoids 5, 6, 14 and compound 20 could significantly inhibit the expression of fibronectin, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and interleukin-6 at the concentration of 50 muM. CONCLUSIONS: The results revealed that sesquiterpenoids may be the active compounds in C. cassia bark on diabetic nephropathy which provided new evidences for the traditional use of this herb to treat diabetic nephropathy and associated kidney diseases.	c. cassia diabetic nephropathy
1	Differentiating parts of Cinnamomum cassia using LC-qTOF-MS in conjunction with principal component analysis.Cinnamon bark (Rou Gui in Chinese), cinnamon twig (Gui Zhi) and shaved cinnamon bark (Gui Sin) have been widely used as spices and in traditional Chinese medicine since ancient times. On-going issues related to quality and authenticity necessitate the development of analytical methods capable of providing an objective evaluation of samples. In this study, chemical fingerprints of cinnamon bark, cinnamon twigs and shaved cinnamon bark were established using liquid chromatography quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometry in conjunction with principal component analysis (PCA). From 125 samples of cinnamon, we identified the following eight compounds and their the detection ratios: coumarin, cinnamaldehyde, cinnamyl alcohol, cinnamic acid, 2-hydroxycinnamaldehyde, 2-hydroxycinnamic acid, 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde and 4-methoxycinnamaldehyde. Of these, 4-methoxycinnamaldehyde presented the largest variations in detection ratio, making up 64.0, 97.4 and 50.0% in cinnamon bark, cinnamon twig, and shaved cinnamon bark, respectively. The quantities of cinnamyl alcohol, coumarin and cinnamaldehyde also varied between the three parts of the plant. Chemical fingerprints of the three cinnamon samples were established using principal component analysis, the results of which indicate that cinnamon bark and shaved cinnamon bark could be easily differentiated, despite a marked similarity in outward appearance. Cinnamon twig was also shown to depart from the other clusters. The proposed method provides a fast and efficient means of identifying cinnamon herbs for quality control purposes.

2	Medicinal plants from nepal: evaluation as inhibitors of leukotriene biosynthesis.The methanolic extracts of 25 different Nepalese medicinal plants were tested for their activity to inhibit the biosynthesis of leukotriene B(4) in bovine polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The selected indigenous plants are used in traditional herb remedies to treat inflammatory diseases such as asthma, bronchitis, rheumatism, and skin disorders presumed to be mediated by leukotrienes. The leaves of Zanthoxylum nepalensis were shown to be the most potent inhibitor with an IC(50) value of 11 microgram/ml. The extracts obtained from Astercantha longifolia and Hedychium ellipticum also exhibited potent inhibitory action with IC(50) values of 20 and 22 microgram/ml, respectively.	hedychium ellipticum bronchitis
2	Combination of Zizyphus jujuba and green tea extracts exerts excellent cytotoxic activity in HepG2 cells via reducing the expression of APRIL.Hepatocellular carcinoma is a type of tumor highly resistant to available chemotherapeutic agents. The treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma remains a challenge that needs new approaches in the future. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the chloroform fraction (CHCl(3)-F) from Z. jujuba has anticancer activity in human liver cancer cells (HepG2), and that combining CHCl(3)-F with green tea extracts (GTE) results in enhanced effects of anticancer activity in the cells. To further understand the mechanism of the anticancer activity of combining CHCl(3)-F and GTE in HepG2 cells, we investigated whether the addition of a mixture of CHCl(3)-F and GTE would affect the expression of APRIL (a proliferation-inducing ligand), which was expressed in HepG2 cells from 4 hours of incubation in vitro. We have shown that CHCl(3)-F and GTE enhanced anti-cancer activity by reducing the expression of APRIL. We speculate that the CHCl(3)-F and GTE mixture might provide a lead to a new drug design to treat hepatocellular carcinoma in the future.	z. jujuba hepatocellular carcinoma
1	Inter-strains comparison of the antimicrobial effect and mode of action of a Vietnamese Cinnamomum cassia essential oil from leaves and its principal component against Listeria monocytogenes.The antibacterial activity of a Cinnamomum essential oil and of its main component trans-cinnamaldehyde (90% w/w) was examined against 5 Listeria monocytogenes strains. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of C. cassia essential oil against the 5 L. monocytogenes strains were identical (250 microg.mL-1 ) while the minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) ranged between 800 and 1200 microg.mL-1 . In order to study if this essential oil and trans-cinnamaldehyde altered the 5 strains at the membrane level, fluorescence anisotropy of 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) was measured in presence of different concentrations (1/2MIC, MIC, 2MIC) of these antibacterial agents. A concentration dependent increase of fluorescence anisotropy of DPH in their presence reflecting a rigidification of the membrane was observed for the 5 strains. This modification of the membrane fluidity was associated with a perturbation of the selective membrane permeability, as a perturbation of the gradient between intracellular and extracellular pH was also observed.	c. cassia DPH
1	Cinnamon extract induces tumor cell death through inhibition of NFkappaB and AP1.BACKGROUND: Cinnamomum cassia bark is the outer skin of an evergreen tall tree belonging to the family Lauraceae containing several active components such as essential oils (cinnamic aldehyde and cinnamyl aldehyde), tannin, mucus and carbohydrate. They have various biological functions including anti-oxidant, anti-microbial, anti-inflammation, anti-diabetic and anti-tumor activity. Previously, we have reported that anti-cancer effect of cinnamon extracts is associated with modulation of angiogenesis and effector function of CD8+ T cells. In this study, we further identified that anti-tumor effect of cinnamon extracts is also link with enhanced pro-apoptotic activity by inhibiting the activities NFkappaB and AP1 in mouse melanoma model. METHODS: Water soluble cinnamon extract was obtained and quality of cinnamon extract was evaluated by HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) analysis. In this study, we tested anti-tumor activity and elucidated action mechanism of cinnamon extract using various types of tumor cell lines including lymphoma, melanoma, cervix cancer and colorectal cancer in vitro and in vivo mouse melanoma model. RESULTS: Cinnamon extract strongly inhibited tumor cell proliferation in vitro and induced active cell death of tumor cells by up-regulating pro-apoptotic molecules while inhibiting NFkappaB and AP1 activity and their target genes such as Bcl-2, BcL-xL and survivin. Oral administration of cinnamon extract in melanoma transplantation model significantly inhibited tumor growth with the same mechanism of action observed in vitro. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that anti-tumor effect of cinnamon extracts is directly linked with enhanced pro-apoptotic activity and inhibition of NFkappaB and AP1 activities and their target genes in vitro and in vivo mouse melanoma model. Hence, further elucidation of active components of cinnamon extract could lead to development of potent anti-tumor agent or complementary and alternative medicine for the treatment of diverse cancers.	cinnamomum cassia cinnamyl aldehyde
2	All-trans-configuration in Zanthoxylum alkylamides swaps the tingling with a numbing sensation and diminishes salivation.The methanol soluble prepared from a supercritical fluid extract of Szechuan pepper (Zanthoxylum piperitum) was screened for its key tingling and numbing chemosensates by application of taste dilution analysis. Further separation of fractions perceived with the highest sensory impact, followed by LC-TOF-MS, LC-MS, and 1D/2D NMR experiments, led to the structure determination of the known alkylamides hydroxy-gamma-sanshool (1), hydroxy-alpha-sanshool (2), hydroxy-beta-sanshool (3), bungeanool (4), isobungeanool (5), and hydroxy-gamma-isosanshool (6), as well as hydroxy-epsilon-sanshool (7), the structure of which has not yet been confirmed by NMR, and hydroxy-zeta-sanshool (8), which has not been previously reported in the literature. Psychophysical half-tongue experiments using filter paper rectangles (1 x 2 cm) as the vehicle revealed amides 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, showing at least one cis-configured double bond, elicited the well-known tingling and paresthetic orosensation above threshold levels of 3.5-8.3 nmol/cm(2). In contrast, the all-trans-configured amides 3 and 6 induced a numbing and anesthetic sensation above thresholds of 3.9 and 7.1 nmol/cm(2), respectively. Interestingly, the mono-cis-configured major amide 2 was found to induce massive salivation, whereas the all-trans-configuration of 3 did not. 	zanthoxylum piperitum salivation
2	Hepatoprotective activity of ethanolic extracts of bark of Zanthoxylum armatum DC in CCl4 induced hepatic damage in rats.AIM OF THE STUDY: Zanthoxylum armatum DC is described as a hepatoprotective in Ayurveda, the Indian system of medicine. However, there is no scientific basis or reports in the modern literature regarding its usefulness as a hepatoprotective agent. The present study was carried out to evaluate the hepatoprotective activity of ethanolic extract of bark of Zanthoxylum armatum DC in CCl(4) induced hepatotoxicity in male Wistar rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ethanolic extracts at doses of 100, 200, and 400mg/kg were administered orally once daily for 7 days. The hepatoprotective activity was assessed using various biochemical parameters like alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, serum bilirubin, total protein and serum antioxidant enzymes along with histopathological studies of liver tissue. RESULTS: The substantially elevated serum enzymatic levels of serum transaminases, alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin were significantly restored towards normalization by the extracts. Bark extracts significantly increased the levels of antioxidant enzymes: superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione. Phytochemical analysis revealed presence of isoquinoline alkaloid, berberine, as well as flavonoids and phenolic compounds, which have been known for their hepatoprotective activities. CONCLUSIONS: Zanthoxylum armatum DC possesses significant protective effect against hepatotoxicity induced by CCl(4) which may be attributed to the individual or combined action of phytoconstituents present in it.	zanthoxylum armatum dc hepatotoxicity
2	Some southern African plant species used to treat helminth infections in ethnoveterinary medicine have excellent antifungal activities.BACKGROUND: Diseases caused by microorganisms and parasites remain a major challenge globally and particularly in sub-Saharan Africa to man and livestock. Resistance to available antimicrobials and the high cost or unavailability of antimicrobials complicates matters. Many rural people use plants to treat these infections. Because some anthelmintics e.g. benzimidazoles also have good antifungal activity we examined the antifungal activity of extracts of 13 plant species used in southern Africa to treat gastrointestinal helminth infections in livestock and in man. METHODS: Antifungal activity of acetone leaf extracts was determined by serial microdilution with tetrazolium violet as growth indicator against Aspergillus fumigatus, Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans. These pathogens play an important role in opportunistic infections of immune compromised patients. Cytotoxicity was determined by MTT cellular assay. Therapeutic indices were calculated and selectivity for different pathogens determined. We proposed a method to calculate the relation between microbicidal and microbistatic activities. Total activities for different plant species were calculated. RESULTS: On the whole, all 13 extracts had good antifungal activities with MIC values as low as 0.02 mg/mL for extracts of Clausena anisata against Aspergillus fumigatus and 0.04 mg/mL for extracts of Zanthoxylum capense, Clerodendrum glabrum, and Milletia grandis, against A. fumigatus. Clausena anisata extracts had the lowest cytotoxicity (LC50) of 0.17 mg/mL, a reasonable therapeutic index (2.65) against A. fumigatus. It also had selective activity against A. fumigatus, an overall fungicidal activity of 98% and a total activity of 3395 mL/g against A. fumigatus. This means that 1 g of acetone leaf extract can be diluted to 3.4 litres and it would still inhibit the growth. Clerodendrum glabrum, Zanthoxylum capense and Milletia grandis extracts also yielded promising results. CONCLUSIONS: Some plant extracts used for treatment of parasitic infections also have good antifungal activity. Because it is much easier to isolate antifungal compounds by bioassay guided fractionation, this approach may facilitate the isolation of anthelmintic compounds from active plant extracts. The viability of this approach can be tested by isolating the antifungal compounds and then determining its anthelmintic activity. Some of these plant extracts may also be useful in combating fungal infections.	zanthoxylum capense parasitic infections
2	[Pharmacological study on spleen-stomach warming and analgesic action of Cinnamomum cassia Presl].This study deals with the antiulcer effect of water extract and ether extract of Cinnamomum cassia on four types of experimental gastric ulcer and with the antidiarrhea effect on two types of medicine-induced diarrhea in mice. These extracts have choleretic effect in anesthetized rats, and are analgesic as well. This is the pharmacologic basis of spleen-stomach warming and analgesic action of Cinnamomum cassia.	cinnamomum cassia gastric ulcer
3	Mediation of beta-endorphin by myricetin to lower plasma glucose in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.Streptozotocin-induced diabetic (STZ-diabetic) rats were employed to investigate the mechanism(s) whereby myricetin, the active principle of Abelmoschus moschatus (Malvaceae), exerts its glucose-lowering effects. Myricetin was purified from the aerial portion of the plant and administered intravenously. A dose-dependent decrease in plasma glucose concentration was observed 30 min following injection, in parallel with increased plasma beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity (BER). Myricetin enhanced BER release similarly from isolated adrenal medulla. Plasma glucose-lowering and BER-elevating effects of myricetin were both eliminated after bilateral adrenalectomy. Myricetin failed to lower plasma glucose after treatment with opioid mu-receptor antagonists and in opioid mu-receptor knockout diabetic mice. Injection of myricetin three times daily for three consecutive days resulted in increased expression of the glucose transporter subtype 4 (GLUT 4) in soleus muscle and in reduced expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) in liver; these inductions were preventable by opioid mu-receptor blockade. Findings support the conclusion that the plasma glucose-lowering action of myricetin in insulin-deficient animals is mediated by activation of opioid mu-receptors of peripheral tissues in response to increased beta-endorphin secretion. Opioid mu-receptor activation is held responsible for the enhancement of muscle GLUT 4 gene expression and the attenuation of hepatic PEPCK gene expression observed in these myricetin-treated diabetic animals.	myricetin diabetic
1	Anti-complementary activity of triterpenoides from fruits of Zizyphus jujuba.In order to determine on the anti-complement activity of triterpenes, following eleven triterpenoides were isolated from the fruits of the Zizyphus jujuba MILL: ceanothane-type triterpenes: colubrinic acid (1), zizyberenalic acid (11); lupane-type triterpenes: alphitolic acid (2), 3-O-cis-p-coumaroyl alphitolic acid (3), 3-O-trans-p-coumaroyl alphitolic acid (4), betulinic acid (7), betulonic acid (9); and oleanane-type triterpenes: 3-O-cis-p-coumaroyl maslinic acid (5), 3-O-trans-p-coumaroyl maslinic acid (6), oleanolic acid (8), oleanonic acid (10). These compounds were examined for their anti-complement activity against the classical pathway of the complement system. Among them, compounds 5, 6, and 8 exhibited significant anti-complement activity with IC(50) values of 101.4, 143.9, and 163.4 microM, respectively, whereas the ceanothane-type and the lupane-type triterpenes were inactive. This suggests that the oleanane-structure plays an important role in inhibiting the hemolytic activity of human serum against erythrocytes.	zizyphus jujuba ceanothane
1	Antitrypanosomal isoflavan quinones from Abrus precatorius.Human African trypanosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease in sub Saharan Africa that is fatal if left untreated. In a search for new natural products with antitrypanosomal activity, we recently identified abruquinones B and I from Abrus precatorius as potent in vitro trypanocidal compounds with high selectivity indices. To obtain sufficient compound for in vivo efficacy tests in mice, a second batch of plant material was re-collected and extracted. However, the chemical profiles of the two batches differed, and additional abruquinones were isolated and identified by HR-ESI-MS, and 1D and 2D NMR ((1)H, (13)C, COSY, HMBC, HSQC, and NOESY) spectroscopy. Abruquinones J (1), K (2), and L (3) were new, while abruquinones A (4) and D (5) were known from the first batch of plant material. The absolute configuration of compounds 1 to 3 was determined by comparison of electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra with calculated ECD data. Compounds 2 to 5 showed high in vitro activity against T. b. rhodesiense (IC50 of 0.01, 0.02, 0.02 and 0.01 muM, respectively), and remarkable SIs of 508, 374, 1379, and 668, respectively.	abrus precatorius abruquinones
1	Combined analysis by GC (RI), GC-MS and 13C NMR of the supercritical fluid extract of Abies alba twigs.Two samples (leaves and twigs) of Abies alba Miller from Corsica were extracted using supercritical CO2 and their chemical compositions were compared with those of the essential oils obtained from the same batch of plant material. In total 45 components were identified using combined analysis by GC (RI), GC-MS and 13C NMR. It was observed that the contents of monoterpenes (mainly represented by limonene, alpha-pinene and camphene) were significantly lower in the supercritical fluid extract (SFE) than in the essential oil (EO). Conversely, the proportions of sesquiterpenes were much higher in CO2 extracts than in essential oils (around 30% vs 4%). Cis-abienol, a diterpene alcohol, was identified only in SFE, and the proportions of this constituent (7.5% and 17.3%) were determined using quantitative 13C NMR since it was under estimated using the standard conditions of GC.	abies alba limonene
1	Essential Oils, Silver Nanoparticles and Propolis as Alternative Agents Against Fluconazole Resistant Candida albicans, Candida glabrata and Candida krusei Clinical Isolates.Development of effective and safe therapeutic treatment of fungal infections remains one of the major challenge for modern medicine. The aim of presented investigation was to analyze the in vitro antifungal activity of selected essential oils, ethanolic extracts of propolis and silver nanoparticles dropped on TiO2 against azole-resistant C. albicans (n = 20), C. glabrata (n = 14) and C. krusei (n = 10) clinical isolates. Among tested essential oils, the highest activity has definitely been found in the case of the oil isolated from the bark of Cinnamomum cassia, with MIC and MFC values for all tested strains in the range of 0.0006-0.0097 % (v/v) and 0.0012-0.019 % (v/v), respectively. High activity was also observed for the Lemon, Basil, Thyme, Geranium and Clove (from buds) essential oils. Significant differences in fungicidal activity have been observed in the case of four tested propolis samples. Only one of them revealed high activity, with MFC values in the range from 0.156 to 1.25 % (v/v). Satisfactory fungicidal activity, against C. albicans and C. glabrata isolates, was also observed in the case of silver nanoparticles, however C. krusei isolates were mostly resistant. We also revealed that constituents of most of essential oils and propolis as well as silver nanoparticles are not substrates for drug transporters, which belong to the most important factors affecting resistance of Candida spp. clinical isolates to many of conventional antimycotics. To conclude, the results of our investigation revealed that essential oils, propolis and silver nanoparticles represent high potential for controlling and prevention candidiasis. 	c. albicans essential oils
1	Bioactivity-Oriented Purification of Polyphenols from Cinnamomum cassia Presl. with Anti-Proliferation Effects on Colorectal Cancer Cells.Cinnamomum cassia Presl. (CCP) is a popular natural spice possessing various pharmacological properties. We obtained polyphenol-rich fraction (CCP-P) from CCP by bioactivity-oriented purification method and evaluated its Wnt signaling inhibition activity. Firstly, the phenolic components were identified as the main bioactive compounds with anti-colorectal cancer activity. Then, we compared the anti-colorectal cancer activity of CCP extract obtained from different solvent by cell morphology alteration and EdU assay. Ethanol extract showed higher antiproliferative activity compared to water extract on HCT116 cells, with proliferating cells reducing to 41.12 and 21.83% at 156.00 mug GAE/mL, respectively. Next, separation and enrichment of polyphenols from ethanol extract was performed on AB-8 macroporous resins under optimal conditions. Further evaluation of the CCP-P bioactivity revealed that it exerted more potent antiproliferative activity on RKO and HCT116 cells, showing higher selectivity for Wnt-dependent colorectal cancer cells (CRCs). Ten major polyphenols were identified in the CCP-P by UPLC-ESI-MS/MS. In summary, this study presents evidence that CCP-derived polyphenols are promising potential candidates as functional food ingredients against CRC.	cinnamomum cassia polyphenols
1	Identification of the potential active components of Abelmoschus manihot in rat blood and kidney tissue by microdialysis combined with ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry.In this paper, microdialysis combining with ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) was applied to simultaneously identify components in blood and kidney dialysis after oral administration of Abelmoschus manihot extract. Microdialysis probe was implanted in the jugular vein and the kidney medulla, respectively; microdialysis samples were collected continuously, transferred to microtubes and analyzed by UPLC-Q-TOF/MS. The components in microdialysis samples were separated by an UPLC HSS T3 column and eluted with acetonitrile and water (containing 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The results showed that unbound constituents in blood circulation of the rat include hyperoside, isoquercitrin, quercetin monoglucuronide, quercetin-3'-O-glucoside, quercetin, myricetin, and hibifolin while unbound constituents in kidney are hyperoside, isoquercitrin, quercetin monoglucuronide, which might be the potential active components in vivo. The developed method was simple and reliable, and could be adopted to rapidly screen and identify potential active components contributing to pharmacological effects of TCM and to better clarify its action mechanism.	abelmoschus manihot hibifolin
3	Selective stimulation by cinnamaldehyde of progesterone secretion in human adrenal cells.AIMS: Cinnamon bark has been used to treat menstrual pain and infertility. While several pharmacological studies have suggested anti-inflammatory properties, the mechanisms by which the herb exerts its various activities have not been well understood. Recent reports suggest menstrual distress is related to higher estradiol levels, higher estradiol/progesterone ratios. Cinnamaldehyde, a major active constituent of Cinnamomum cassia has been shown to stimulate cathecholamine release from adrenal glands. The objective of the present study is to examine whether cinnamaldehyde stimulates secretion of progesterone and other steroid hormones in human adrenal cells. MAIN METHODS: Human adrenal cells, H295R were exposed for 24h in a serum-free medium to various concentrations of cinnamaldehyde. Steroid hormones in the cultured medium were measured by a highly sensitive LC-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. KEY FINDINGS: Exposure to cinnamaldehyde increased progesterone release in a dose-dependent manner. Testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone concentrations decreased in the presence of cinnamaldehyde. The release of cortisol or estradiol was not affected by treatment with cinnamaldehyde. cAMP in the cultured medium was increased from 0.06+/-0.0007pmol/ml to 0.12+/-0.0028pmol/ml by exposure to cinnamaldehyde. The addition of isobutylmehtylxanthine, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, caused a doubling of the amount of cAMP up to 0.397+/-0.036pmol/ml in the presence of cinnamaldehyde. SIGNIFICANCE: These data suggest that cinnamaldehyde selectively induced progesterone production and inhibited production of testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone in human adrenal cells.	cinnamaldehyde infertility
3	Anti-gastric actions of eugenol and cinnamic acid isolated from Cinnamomi Ramulus.We investigated the evidence of gastric protection for ulcer and gastritis by Cinnamomi Ramulus (Cinnamomum cassia Blume, Geiji, CR) extract and its several constituents. CR ethanolic extract showed the potent antioxidant activity and cytotoxicity of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and acid-neutralizing capacity. Especially, eugenol exerted a significant antioxidant activity and inhibited the colonization of H. pylori. In vivo test, eugenol and cinnamic acid significantly inhibited HCl/ethanol-induced gastric lesions and increased the mucus content though they didn't inhibit gastric secretion effectively. Taken together, eugenol and cinnamic acid, which were isolated from CR, exhibited the antioxidant activity in vitro and protective effect against gastric damage in vivo through stimulation of mucus secretion and so on. It suggested that they are useful as the neutraceuticals for gastritis.	cinnamic acid gastritis
1	In vitro efficacy of 75 essential oils against Aspergillus niger.Aspergillus niger is an opportunistic human pathogen and a strong air pollutant. A study was conducted with 75 different essential oils for the inhibition of hyphal growth and spore formation in Aspergillus niger. Cinnamomum zeylanicum (bark), Cinnamomum zeylanicum (leaf), Cinnamomum cassia, Syzygium aromaticum and Cymbopogon citratus were the top five essential oils which demonstrated marked inhibitory effect against hyphal growth and spore formation of A. niger. The chemical composition of these five most active essential oils was investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectra (GC-MS). Most of the other essential oils were found challenging to combat A. niger, suggesting their use as strong aroma therapeutic agents.	cinnamomum cassia essential oils
1	Aroma constituents and alkylamides of red and green huajiao (Zanthoxylum bungeanum and Zanthoxylum schinifolium).Huajiao denotes the fruits of various species of Zanthoxylum in the plant family Rutaceare used for cooking. The two most commercially popular species are bungeanum (red huajiao) and schinifolium (green huajiao). Fresh huajiao has a very high content of essential oil, up to 11%, which is described as having fresh, spicy, floral, cooling, and green aroma notes. A comprehensive analysis of the essential oils by GC-MS using advanced peak deconvolution and data processing software, revealed many overlapping components. A total of 120 aroma compounds for each species has been found. In the essential oils, linalyl acetate (15%), linalool (13%), and limonene (12%) are the major components of red huajiao, whereas linalool (29%), limonene (14%), and sabinene (13%) are the major components of green huajiao. For estimation of the aroma contribution of individual components, a new concept, "aroma character impact value" (ACI), is introduced as the percentage of the ratio of the concentration of an aroma component to its odor threshold value. Despite the differences in major components, both species have six common compounds of top aroma character impact: linalool, alpha-terpineol, myrcene, 1,8-cineole, limonene, and geraniol. The tingling sensation of huajiao is caused mainly by the alkylamide hydroxy-alpha-sanshool. The tingling compound decomposes easily under hydrolytic conditions or under UV light.

2	In vitro anti-Helicobacter pylori action of 30 Chinese herbal medicines used to treat ulcer diseases.Infection by Helicobacter pylori has been ascertained to be an important etiologic impetus leading usually to chronic active gastritis and gastric ulcer with growing incidences worldwide. Utilizing as the test pathogen a standard and five clinic strains of Helicobacter pylori, the antibacterial action was assessed in vitro with ethanol extracts of 30 Chinese herbal medicines which have been frequently prescribed since ancient times for treating gastritis-like disorders. Among the 30 tested materials, the ethanol extracts of Abrus cantoniensis (Fabaceae), Saussurea lappa (Asteraceae) and Eugenia caryophyllata (Myrtaceae) were strongly inhibitory to all test strains (MICs: approximately 40 microg/ml), and Hippophae rhamnoides (Elaeagnaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii (Liliaceae), Magnolia officinalis and Schisandra chinensis (Magnoliaceae), Corydalis yanhusuo (Papaveraceae), Citrus reticulata (Rutaceae), Bupleurum chinense and Ligusticum chuanxiong (Apiaceae) substantially active with MICs close to 60.0 microg/ml. As to antibacterial actions of the aqueous extracts of the same drugs, those derived from Cassia obtusifolia (Fabaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii and Eugenia caryophyllata were remarkably inhibitory against all the six Helicobacter pylori strains (MICs: approximately 60 microg/ml). The work compared almost quantitatively the magnitude of the anti-Helicobacter pylori actions of the 30 most prescribed gastritis-treating Chinese herbal drugs, and located as well some source plants where potent anti-Helicobacter pylori phytochemicals could be characterized.	fritillaria thunbergii ulcer diseases
1	Anticancer effect of a new benzophenanthridine isolated from Zanthoxylum madagascariense (Rutaceline).Fractionation of the cyclohexane extract from the stem bark powder of Zanthoxylum madagascariense led to the isolation of a new benzophenanthridine-type alkaloid, hydrochloride of 2,3-methylendioxy-8-hydroxy- 7-methoxy-benzo[C]phenanthridine (Rutaceline), characterized on the basis of its spectral data. Rutaceline was evaluated for its antiproliferative capacity on the human colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) and the African green monkey kidney (Vero) cell lines. The 50% inhibition of cell growth (IC50) obtained after 24 h incubation was similar for both cells lines (110-115 microg/ml, i.e. 269-281 microM), but at 48 h the IC50 value for the Caco-2 cells was lower than for the Vero cells (20 microg/lml, i.e. 49 microM versus 90 microg/ml, i.e. 220 microM) indicating a higher cell growth inhibitory effect on the colon adenocarcinoma cells. At the respective IC50 concentrations, Rutaceline did not significantly induce apoptosis but induced cell cycle arrest in the GO/G1 phase, as well as a decrease of cells in S phase. Rutaceline also induced DNA fragmentation in both cell lines, as revealed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and a dose-dependent clastogenic effect in both cell lines as revealed by the Comet assay.	zanthoxylum madagascariense benzophenanthridine
3	Differential antiproliferation effect of 2'-benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde in K-ras-transformed cells via downregulation of thiol antioxidants.2'-Benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde (BCA), one of the derivatives of 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (HCA) isolated from the bark of Cinnamomum cassia, induces apoptosis in human cancer cells. We found that BCA induces stronger antiproliferative effects in K-ras-transformed cells (RK3E-ras) than in isogenic non-transformed cells (RK3E). Treatment of RK3E-ras with BCA resulted in increased ROS generation and depletion of intracellular glutathione, whereas BCA-treated RK3E showed no significant increase in the ROS level with concurrent increase in intracellular glutathione (GSH). Thiol antioxidants recovered cell proliferation inhibition caused by BCA in both cell lines, while non-thiol antioxidants failed to recover cell death. BCA decreased metallothionein (MT) expression in RK3E-ras, while inducing remarkable MT expression in RK3E. The increase of intracellular GSH in RK3E is partially caused by differential induction of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS) due to BCA treatment. To evaluate the upstream pathway for differential expression of gamma-GCS and MT, we analyzed early DJ-1 (PARK7) and NF-E2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) changes after BCA treatment. In RK3E, DJ-1 expression considerably increased for 3 h with concurrent induction of Nrf2, whereas in RK3E-ras cells BCA decreased these protein levels. Based on these findings, it seems that the therapeutic selectivity of BCA in RK3E-ras results from decreased thiol antioxidants via decreased DJ-1 and Nrf2 expression.	BCA cancer
3	Cinnamaldehyde protects against oxidative stress and inhibits the TNF-alpha-induced inflammatory response in human umbilical vein endothelial cells.Oxidative stress and inflammation play critical roles in the development of cardiovascular diseases. Cinnamaldehyde (CA) is a natural compound from Cinnamomum cassia, and its anticancer, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities have been widely investigated. In the present study, the cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of CA on H2O2- or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-exposed human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were examined. CA and its natural derivative, 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde (MCA), markedly increased the cellular protein level of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and promoted the translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) to the nucleus. CA-mediated Nrf2/HO-1 activation protected the HUVECs from H2O2-induced oxidative stress, which promotes apoptosis. HO-1 depletion by siRNA attenuated the CA-mediated cell protective effects against oxidative stress. Additionally, CA markedly inhibited the adhesion of U937 monocytic cells to HUVECs by decreasing the expression level of vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM-1). An in vivo experiment confirmed the anti-inflammatory effects of CA, as lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory cell infiltration was effectively inhibited by the compound. Overall, these observations suggest that CA may be used as a therapeutic agent for oxidative stress-mediated cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis.	Cinnamaldehyde cardiovascular diseases
2	Phenylpropanoids from cinnamon bark reduced beta-amyloid production by the inhibition of beta-secretase in Chinese hamster ovarian cells stably expressing amyloid precursor protein.beta-Amyloid (Abeta) is a substance of Alzheimer disease (AD), which is generated via the amyloidogenic pathway from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-secretase and gamma-secretase. Inhibition of Abeta production is a potential therapeutic approach to AD. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that cinnamon bark (Cinnamomi Cortex Spissus), the dried bark of Cinnamomum cassia Blume (Lauraceae), and its constituents are beneficial to AD. The methanol extract of cinnamon bark efficiently reduced Abeta40 production in Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cells stably expressing APP as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Bioassay-guided isolation of cinnamon bark extract was carried out using open column chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography, and the following 6 phenylpropanoids were isolated: syringaresinol (1); medioresinol (2); coumarin (3); 2-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (4); cryptamygin A (5); and 3',5,7-trimethoxy epicatechin (6). Among these, 4 mug/mL medioresinol and cryptamygin A reduced Abeta40 production by 50% and 60%, respectively, compared with dimethyl sulfoxide-treated control cells. The IC50 values of medioresinol and cryptamygin A for the inhibition of Abeta40 production were 10.8 and 8.2 mug/mL, respectively. Furthermore, treatment of APP-CHO cells with either compound decreased the amount of beta-secretase and sAPPbeta (the proteolytic fragment of APP catalyzed by beta-secretase). These results suggest that the antiamyloidogenic activity of cinnamon bark extract was exerted by medioresinol and cryptamygin A via a reduction in the amount of beta-secretase. The extract of cinnamon bark contains potentially valuable antiamyloidogenic agents for the prevention and treatment of AD.	cinnamon AD
2	Sperm antimotility properties of a seed extract of Abrus precatorius.This study examined the inhibitory effects of a methanol extract of Abrus precatorius seeds on the motility of washed human spermatozoa. The extract caused a concentration-related impairment of percentage sperm motility; with the EC50 concentration being 2.29 mg/ml. This effect on motility was essentially irreversible. With the highest concentration tested (20.0 mg/ml), the onset of the antimotility action was almost immediate. In addition, this concentration impaired the functional integrity of the plasma membrane (hypoosmotic swelling test) and viability (nigrosin-eosin stain) of spermatozoa. In contrast, with a lower concentration (5.0 mg/ml), such effects were not evident. It is concluded that at the lower concentrations the antimotility action may result from a rise in intracellular calcium (not via influx) and/or a decline in cAMP content and/or enhanced generation of a reactive oxygen species.	abrus precatorius hypoosmotic swelling
1	Quantitative and structural analysis of amides and lignans in Zanthoxylum armatum by UPLC-DAD-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS.A rapid and simple ultra performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection (UPLC-DAD) method has been developed for the simultaneous quantification of four biologically important furofuran lignans, asarinin, sesamin, fargesin and kobusin, and an amide, armatamide in Zanthoxylum armatum within 7min. The separation was carried out on a BEH C18 column (2.1mmx100mm, 1.7mum particle size) with 0.05% formic acid aqueous solution and acetonitrile as mobile phase under gradient conditions at 25 C. The method was validated and found to be linear (R(2)&gt;=0.9997), precise in terms of peak areas (intra-day RSDs&lt;=0.62% and inter-day RSDs&lt;=2.95%) and accurate (95.6-104.0%). The developed method was applied to the quality assessment of different parts (leaves, bark and seeds) of Z. armatum including locational variation of leaves samples. Significant variation in the amount of amides and furofuran lignans was observed. Tandem electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (UPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS) of samples led to the identification of sixteen compounds in the category of amides and furofuran lignans. 	z. armatum sesamin
2	Abrus agglutinin inhibits oral carcinogenesis through inactivation of NRF2 signaling pathway.Abrus agglutinin (AGG), a heterotetrameric type II ribosome inactivating protein isolated from the seeds of Abrus precatorius shows potent antitumor activity in different cancer models. We examined the role of antioxidant system in modulation of the anticancer activity of AGG in in vitro and in hamster model of oral cancer. AGG promotes apoptosis through accumulation of ROS in CAL33 cells. Interestingly, our data showed that AGG decreases the activity of antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase in CAL33 cells indicating antioxidant enzyme inhibition leads to AGG-induced ROS accumulation. Moreover, AGG inhibits expression of NRF2, transcription factor which regulates the expression of antioxidant enzymes in CAL33 cells. We found that AGG induces autophagy induction and loss of p62 expression in CAL33 cells. Furthermore, it showed that NRF2 expression is restored in the presence of 3-methyladenine and Baficomycin-A1 establishing role of autophagy in modulation of NRF2 through p62. Our study showed that AGG significantly inhibited tumor growth in DMBA-induced carcinogenesis. In immunohistochemical analysis, AGG-treated tumor displays higher caspase3 expression and less p62 and NRF2 expression in comparison to the control. In conclusion, AGG-induced degradation of NRF2 through autophagy leads to ROS accumulation dependent apoptosis which might be used for treatment of oral cancer.	abrus precatorius cancer
1	Composition of essential oils from seeds of Abies koreana.The essential oils from seeds of nine Abies koreana specimens have been studied using GC-MS-FID and NMR methods, leading to the determination of 96 volatiles, which constituted over 99% of the oils. The hydrodistilled oils of fresh, resinous scent were isolated with yields in the range of 3.8-8.5%. The results showed that the essential oil of Korean fir seeds contained 70-95% monoterpenes and 1-20% oxygenated monoterpenes as the dominant groups. The numerous sesquiterpenes, diterpenes and their oxygenated derivatives constituted only 2-8% of the oil. The major component of the seed essential oil was limonene (41-72 g/100g); the laevorotary form of this terpene predominated. A. koreana seeds seem to be a rich source of both essential oil and (-)-limonene, whose average enantiomeric excess was above 95%.	a. koreana essential oil
1	Methylxanthines reversibly inhibit tracheary-element differentiation in suspension cultures of Zinnia elegans L.Tracheary-element (TE) differentiation in suspension-cultured mesophyll cells of Zinnia elegans L. was completely inhibited by caffeine and theophylline only when these methylxanthines were applied at least 8 h prior to the appearance of secondary cell-wall thickenings. In contrast, the calcium-channel blocker nifedipine completely inhibited TE differentiation when applied only 2-3 h prior to the onset of secondary cell-wall deposition. This indicates the involvement of a methylxanthine-inhibitable event in TE differentiation that is distinguishable from an event dependent on influx of extracellular calcium. The correlation between the time of appearance of chlorotetracycline fluorescence (an indicator of sequestered Ca(2+)) and loss of methylxanthine effectiveness indicates that inhibition by methylxanthines may result from release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores. Methylxanthines with high potencies against adenosine 3' : 5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) phosphodiesterase and adenosine receptors were less effective inhibitors of TE differentiation, indicating that inhibition of differentiation by methylxanthines is independent of cAMP metabolism. The role of cAMP in transduction of the cytokinin signal, which was proposed previously on the basis of stimulation of TE differentiation by theophylline, was investigated using the non-hydrolyzable analog 8-bromo-cAMP. Although 8-bromo-cAMP stimulated differentiation in the absence of inductive concentrations of cytokinin, the non-cyclic analog 8-bromo-AMP was even more effective, indicating that 8-bromo-cAMP behaves as a cytokinin analog, rather than a second messenger, in stimulating TE differentiation. 	zinnia elegans nifedipine
1	Studies on the effects of essential-oil-based feed additives on performance, ileal nutrient digestibility, and selected bacterial groups in the gastrointestinal tract of piglets.The aim of this study was to assess the effects of 2 different phytogenic products on performance, ileal nutrient digestibility, and composition of the intestinal microbiota. The 2 phytogenic products contained different essential oil mixtures (EOM) characterized by either menthol (Mentha arvensis; EOM-M) or cinnamon aldehyde (Cinnamomum aromaticum; EOM-C) as main constituents. Three treatments consisted of control diet without EOM addition and diets supplemented with EOM-M or EOM-C. Reproducibility of the effects was examined in 4 trials with a total of 300 male castrated and female piglets weaned at 25 d of age. The number of pens per treatment in trials I through III were 7, 9, and 9, respectively, for research station conditions, and 10 in trial IV for simulated farm conditions. In research station conditions, the experimental unit consisted of flat deck pens with 2 piglets per pen, whereas it consisted of floor pens with straw bedding with 5 piglets per pen in farm conditions. The feed additives had no effect on feed intake or BW gain. Improvements (P &lt; 0.05) in G:F were observed for EOM-M supplemented diets in 2 of 4 trials as well as for the combined data of all trials. These improvements were associated with greater (P&lt;0.05) apparent ileal digestibility of CP and of most AA. The effect of EOM-C on these response criteria was intermediate between control and EOM-M. Real-time PCR analysis of the gastrointestinal contents for 7 bacterial groups (Lactobacillus spp., Enterococcus spp., Clostridium coccoides and Clostridium leptum cluster, Escherichia spp., and Escherichia coli toxin estII) indicated no effect of treatments on the gastrointestinal microbiota. It was concluded that EOM-M consistently improved feed efficiency in weaned piglets, and it was associated with improved ileal protein and AA digestibility. In general, however, the effectiveness of EOM as feed additives differs considerably depending on the constituents.	cinnamon essential oil
1	Microwave-assisted extraction of jujube polysaccharide: Optimization, purification and functional characterization.The operational parameters involved in microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) of jujube polysaccharide including microwave power, water to raw material ratio and extraction temperature and time were optimized by RSM. MAE at 400W, 75 C, 60 min, using 30 g water/g powdered jujube was the best condition for maximum yield (9.02%) of polysaccharide. Two novel water-soluble polysaccharides (JCP-1 and JCP-2) with average molecular weights of 9.1x10(4)-1.5x10(5)Da in term of the symmetrical narrow peaks were identified using the analytical purification procedures. The JCP-1 and JCP-2 mainly composed of glucose, arabinose, galactose and rhamnose in molar ratios of 1.4:2.1:4.2:0.9 and 1.2:1.8:4.1:1.1, respectively. The use of 1.5% JCP-1 led to a high emulsifying stability (95.5%) in a model oil-in-water type emulsion with a reduced surface tension (44.1 mN/m) and droplet size (1.32 mum), and an increased apparent viscosity (0.13 Pas) during 21-day cold storage. The antioxidant activities were increased in dose-dependent manners (25-200 mug/mL).	jujube polysaccharides
1	Isolation, structure elucidation, and biological activity of a new alkaloid from Zanthoxylum rhetsa.Several biologically active alkaloids (1-4, 6), including a new quinazoline-6-carboxylic acid (1), were isolated from the medicinal plant Zanthoxylum rhetsa, an evergreen tree, native to subtropical areas. Whereas the pharmacological properties of the plant extract and single constituents have been widely tested, we now show that all of the metabolites have antialgal activities, all but 6 are antibacterial, and 6 and the reduction product 5 (derived from 4) are also antifungal.	zanthoxylum rhetsa quinazoline-6-carboxylic acid
1	Differentiating parts of Cinnamomum cassia using LC-qTOF-MS in conjunction with principal component analysis.Cinnamon bark (Rou Gui in Chinese), cinnamon twig (Gui Zhi) and shaved cinnamon bark (Gui Sin) have been widely used as spices and in traditional Chinese medicine since ancient times. On-going issues related to quality and authenticity necessitate the development of analytical methods capable of providing an objective evaluation of samples. In this study, chemical fingerprints of cinnamon bark, cinnamon twigs and shaved cinnamon bark were established using liquid chromatography quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometry in conjunction with principal component analysis (PCA). From 125 samples of cinnamon, we identified the following eight compounds and their the detection ratios: coumarin, cinnamaldehyde, cinnamyl alcohol, cinnamic acid, 2-hydroxycinnamaldehyde, 2-hydroxycinnamic acid, 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde and 4-methoxycinnamaldehyde. Of these, 4-methoxycinnamaldehyde presented the largest variations in detection ratio, making up 64.0, 97.4 and 50.0% in cinnamon bark, cinnamon twig, and shaved cinnamon bark, respectively. The quantities of cinnamyl alcohol, coumarin and cinnamaldehyde also varied between the three parts of the plant. Chemical fingerprints of the three cinnamon samples were established using principal component analysis, the results of which indicate that cinnamon bark and shaved cinnamon bark could be easily differentiated, despite a marked similarity in outward appearance. Cinnamon twig was also shown to depart from the other clusters. The proposed method provides a fast and efficient means of identifying cinnamon herbs for quality control purposes.

4	Abrus abrin derived peptides induce apoptosis by targeting mitochondria in HeLa cells.In our previous study, Abrus abrin derived peptide fraction (ABP) with molecular weight in range of 600-1500Da was shown to have potent antitumor activity in Dalton's lymphoma (DL) tumor bearing mice. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the mechanism of mitochondrial apoptosis induced by the peptide fraction. ABP was found to have selective antiproliferative activity (10ng-100ng/ml) on several tumor cell lines in vitro without having any cytotoxic effect on normal cell lines with a dose of 1000ng/ml. Analysis of the growth inhibitory mechanism in HeLa cells revealed DNA fragmentation with appearance of the sub G(0)/G(1) peak indicative of apoptosis. Further investigation results showed that the apoptotic machinery of HeLa induced by ABP was associated with the release of reactive oxygen species, a drop in mitochondrial transmembrane potential, upregulation of Bax, downregulation of Bcl-2, and activation of caspase-3. The peptide fraction was found to target mitochondria of HeLa cells as observed by confocal microscopy. This peptide fraction offers a source of mitochondria penetrating peptides which might have therapeutic induction of apoptosis in cancer cells.	Bcl-2 cancer

1	Tyrosinase-inhibitory constituents from the twigs of Cinnamomum cassia.A methanol extract of the twigs of Cinnamomum cassia was found to possess inhibitory activity against tyrosinase. Purification of the MeOH extract afforded four new phenolics, cassiferaldehyde (6), icariside DC (9), cinnacassinol (10), and dihydrocinnacasside (13), together with 10 known compounds (1-5, 7-12, and 14). The structures of the new compounds were determined by spectroscopic data interpretation. Compounds 1-6 and 8-13 showed strong inhibitory activity against tyrosinase, with IC(50) values ranging from 0.24 to 0.94 mM.	cinnamomum cassia cassiferaldehyde
2	Review: Diverse pharmacological properties of Cinnamomum cassia: A review.Cinnamomum cassia is widely utilized as a spice in different cookeries worldwide, especially in Asian cuisines. This herb is also being used in different forms of traditional medicine (Unani, Ayurvedic, Japanese and Chinese) for managing conditions like dyspepsia, peptic ulcer disease and ischemic brain injury. Recent studies have shown the scientific evidence for the medicinal use of this particular herb in several diseases like H. pylori infection, diabetes, brain ischemia and cancers. This article reviews the literature on potential benefits of the herb published within the last 10 years. The authors used Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms "Cinnamomum" with "cassia" or "arromaticum" to filter the PubMed database. To date, no systemic review focusing on medicinal use of C. cassia was found in the literature. Various research articles elucidating diverse pharmacological properties of C. cassia were identified. The standardised extract of C. cassia or the active compounds extracted from the herb might prove to be a novel candidate for early prevention and complimentary management of conditions like diabetes mellitus or H. pylori-associated disorders. 	c. cassia brain ischemia
1	Effects of water-soluble carbohydrate concentrate from Chinese jujube on different intestinal and fecal indices.This study was to investigate the effects of water-soluble carbohydrate concentrate (WSCC) prepared from Chinese jujube ( Zizyphus jujuba) on different intestinal and fecal indices in a hamster model. WSCC contained carbohydrates (771 g kg(-1) of WSCC) including glucose, fructose, pectin polysaccharide, and hemicellulose. The administration of WSCC (5.0 and 15 g kg(-1) of diet) effectively ( P&lt;0.05) shortened gastrointestinal transit time (by 34.2-57.3%), reduced cecal ammonia (by 58.1-60.3%), elevated total short-chain fatty acid concentrations in cecum (3-4-fold), increased fecal moisture (147-170%), reduced daily fecal ammonia output (by 31.9-75.8%), and decreased the activities of beta-D-glucuronidase (by 73.0-73.8%), beta-D-glucosidase (by 58.2-85.7%), mucinase (by 46.2-72.6%), and urease (by 31.9-48.7%) in feces. This study suggested that adequate consumption of jujube WSCC (at least 5.0 g kg(-1) of diet or 40 mg day(-1)) might exert favorable effects on improving the gastrointestinal milieu and reducing the exposure of intestinal mucosa to toxic ammonia and other detrimental compounds.	jujube pectin polysaccharide
4	Zingiber cassumunar ROXb. and its active constituent inhibit MMP-9 direct activation by house dust mite allergens and MMP-9 expression in PMA-stimulated human airway epithelial cells.BACKGROUND: House dust mite (HDM) induced matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 plays a role in asthma. Zingiber cassumunar Roxb. (Phlai in Thai) has been used in folk medicine for asthma treatment. OBJECTIVE: We investigated effects of Phlai and its constituent (E)-4-(3',4'-dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-en-1-ol (compound D) on the cleavage of pro- MMP-9 by HDM. The effects of these compounds on phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)- induced MMP-9 gene and protein expression in airway epithelial cells (NCI-H292) were also investigated. METHODS: Pro-MMP-9 was directly activated in vitro with HDM in the presence or absence of the ethanolic extracts of Phlai or compound D for 1 hour. The amount of activated MMP-9 was determined using gelatin zymography. To study the cellular response of Phlai, NCI-H292 cells were pretreated with crude Phlai extracts or compound D for 2 hours, and then the cells were stimulated with PMA for 48 hours. The mRNA RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. MMP-9 activity was determined by gelatin zymography. RESULTS: Crude Phlai extracts (0.25 - 2.0 mg/ml) and compound D (0.5 - 4.0 mg/ml) inhibited pro- MMP-9 cleavage by HDM. Furthermore, crude Phlai extracts (100 mg/ml) and compound D, at concentrations of 50 and 100 mg/ml, attenuated the PMA-induced MMP-9 gene and expression in NCI-H292 cells. These compound also suppressed MMP-9 release from PMA-induced NCI-H292 cells. CONCLUSION: The crude ethanolic extract of Z. cassumunar and its active constituent compound D inhibited the cleavage of pro-MMP-9 by HDM. They also inhibited PMA-induced MMP-9 gene and protein synthesis in human airway epithelial cells.	MMP-9 asthma
2	Suppression of plasminogen activators and the MMP-2/-9 pathway by a Zanthoxylum avicennae extract to inhibit the HA22T human hepatocellular carcinoma cell migration and invasion effects in vitro and in vivo via phosphatase 2A activation.This study shows that the ECM degradation-associated pathway, including uPA and tPA and the downstream MMP-2/-9 protein, was significantly suppressed in HA22T cells treated with a Zanthoxylum avicennae extract (YBBE). The endogenous inhibitors, including TIMP-1/-2 and PAI-1, were enhanced in HA22T cells by the YBBE treatment. The expression of MMP-2/-9 and TIMP-1/-2 was respectively assessed by using RT-PCR and a zymography assay. The mRNA levels and enzymatic activity of MMP-2/-9 were down-regulated by the YBBE treatment in a dose-dependent manner, while the TIMP-1/-2 levels were conversely markedly increased. The PP2A siRNA or PP2A inhibitor totally reversed the YBBE effects, confirming the essential role of PP2A in YBBE inhibiting the HA22T cell migration and invasion effects. Xenografted animal experiments on nude mice demonstrated similiar results to the in vitro system. Both the in vitro and in vivo models clearly demonstrate that YBBE inhibited the highly metastatic HA22T liver cancer cell migration and invasion effects through PP2A activation. 	zanthoxylum avicennae liver cancer
1	Analysis of volatile components, fatty acids, and phytosterols of Abies koreana growing in Poland.Extracts and essential oils from seeds as well as essential oils from cone scales and needles with twigs of the Abies koreana population were studied. An analysis of Korean fir essential oils allowed us to determine 147 volatile compounds. The identified compounds constituted 97-99% of the seed, cone and needle oils. The main volatile in the seed and needle oils was limonene (56.6% and 23.4%, respectively), while the predominant volatile in cone oils was alpha-pinene (51.2%). Korean fir seeds provided a rich source of both essential oil (3.8-8.5%) and extract, which was isolated with a 24.5% yield and contained numerous groups of fatty acids and phytosterols (414 microg/100g extract). The most prominent fatty acids were unsaturated, among which linoleic (41.2%) and oleic (31.2%) fatty acid were the main ones while the dominant sterols were isomers of ergostadienol and beta-sitosterol. A. koreana seeds, cones and needles are a source of many volatile bioactive compounds while the seed extract, with a pleasant scent, contained not only volatiles, but also fractions rich in fatty acids and phytosterols. These facts make A. koreana essential oils and especially the seed extract potential components of cosmetics.	a. koreana oleic
1	Evaluation of the quality of Chinese and Vietnamese cassia using LC-MS and multivariate analysis.In the present study, the chemical composition of water extracts of Chinese and Vietnamese cassia (Cinnamomum cassia) were compared using multivariate analysis of LC-MS data. By principal component analysis of the LC-MS data, 6 compounds, cinnzeylanine (1), cinnzeylanol (2), anhydrocinnzeylanol (3), cinncasinol A (4), epicatechin (5) and procyanidin B2 (6), were identified as the marker compounds to characterize Chinese and Vietnamese cassia. It was clarified that Chinese cassia contains relatively larger amounts of epicatechin and procyanidin B2. On the other hand, Vietnamese cassia is characterized by a relatively larger amount of diterpenes. As catechin derivatives and diterpenes have different types of activity, it is important to choose the cassia that best suits the product for which it is to be used, whether in food or in herbal medicine.	cinnamomum cassia cinncasinol a
1	[Comparison studies on chemical constituents of essential oil from Ramulus Cinnamomi and Cortex Cinnamomi by GC-MS].Essential oil from Ramulus Cinnamomi (Cinnamomum cassia Presl) and Cortex Cinnamomi were obtained by steam distillation. The chemical components of the oil were examined and compared by means of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. 54 of the separated constitutents were identified. 10 components of these were not observed in the oil from Ramulus Cinnamomi, and 16 components of these were not observed in the oil from Cortex Cinnamomi.	cinnamomum cassia essential oil
1	Dietary Ziziphus jujuba Fruit Influence on Aberrant Crypt Formation and Blood Cells in Colitis-Associated Colorectal Cancer in Mice.Ziziphus jujuba (ZJ) fruit is rich in bioactive functional components such as polysaccharides, triterpenoid acid, flavonoids and oleamide. It has been commonly used in the treatment of various diseases including diabetes, digestive disorders, diarrhea, skin infections, liver and urinary complaints. However, dietary effects with regard to chemoprevention of colon cancer have not been studied. The present study was performed to evaluate the protective effects of dietary ZJ against colitis-associated colon carcinogenesis in azoxymethane (AOM)-dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)-treated mice. AOM was injected (10 mg/kg b.wt., i.p.) and three cycles of 2% DSS in drinking water for 7 days with 14 days of normal drinking water in-between were administered to induce colitis-associated colon cancer. ZJ fruit was supplemented into feed at levels of 5 and 10%. Dietary ZJ significantly attenuated aberrant crypt foci (ACF) formation and also decreased the progression of hyperplasia to dysplasia. In addition, it significantly reduced circulating white blood cells, lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils and platelets compared to colon cancer mice. We conclude that ZJ supplementation may delay the progression of colon cancer from hyperplasia to dysplasia and ultimately adenocarcinoma and cancer. In addition, it decreased circulating tumor-related leukocytes, main regulators of cancer inflammation. Dietary consumption of ZJ fruit attenuated the formation of ACF and delayed the progression of colon cancer. 	ziziphus jujuba flavonoids
2	[Relation between dampness-heat syndrome of glomerulonephritis and sialic acid and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG)].Plasmic and urinary sialic acid and urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) of 87 glomerulonephritic patients with and without Dampness-Heat Syndrome were measured, and the influence of clearing up Dampness-Heat therapy on above-mentioned parameters was investigated. The results showed that Psa, Usa and UNAG of Dampness-Heat Syndrome were significantly higher than those of non-Dampness-Heat Syndrome (P &lt; 0.05-0.01). The further analysis indicated that the patients with acute onset of chronic nephritis manifested as Dampness-Heat, showed marked positive correlation between Usa and UNAG as well as between UNAG and proteinuria respectively (r = 0.75 and 0.722, P &lt; 0.001). With the treatment of Abelmoschus manihot which could remove the Dampness-Heat, the amount of proteinuria, Usa and UNAG were all significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.05-0.001). It suggested that Usa and UNAG might be as diagnostic and curative parameters of Dampness-Heat of glomerulonephritis.	abelmoschus manihot dampness-heat of glomerulonephritis
1	Content variations of triterpenic acid, nucleoside, nucleobase, and sugar in jujube (Ziziphus jujuba) fruit during ripening.Jujube (Ziziphus jujuba) fruit is widely consumed as food and traditional Chinese medicine in Asian countries due to its potential effects for human health. To facilitate selection of the maturity stage providing optimum health benefits, jujube fruits were analysed at six stages of growth (S1-6) for triterpenic acids, nucleosides, nucleobases, and sugars by UHPLC-MS/MS or HPLC-ELSD methods. The content levels of most triterpenic acids and sugars increased with ripening, and reached the highest at S5 and S6, respectively. The accumulation of the cyclic nucleotides (cAMP and cGMP) was mainly in the later stage of ripening (S5-6). Therefore, if taking triterpenic acids as the major quality indicator, S5 should be the ideal time to harvest jujube fruit, and the full ripen stage (S6) maybe the best choice when taking sugars and cyclic nucleotides as the most important components. 	jujube sugars
1	High-performance liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-flame ionization detection characterization of Delta5-polyenoic fatty acids in triacylglycerols from conifer seed oils.Edible conifer seeds can serve as a source of triacylglycerols (TGs) with unusual Delta5 unsaturated polymethylene interrupted fatty acids (UPIFAs), such as cis-5,9-octadecadienoic (taxoleic), cis-5,9,12-octadecatrienoic (pinolenic), cis-5,11-eicosadienoic (keteleeronic) and cis-5,11,14-eicosatrienoic acids (sciadonic). Conifer seed oils from European Larch (Larix decidua), Norway Spruce (Picea abies) and European Silver Fir (Abies alba) have been analyzed by non-aqueous reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (NARP-HPLC) with atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation (APCI)-MS detection. The influence of different positions of double bonds in Delta5-UPIFAs on the retention and fragmentation behavior is described and used for the successful identification of TGs in each oil. TGs containing Delta5-UPIFAs have a higher retention in comparison with common TGs found in plant oils with single methylene interrupted Delta6(9)-FAs and also significantly changed relative abundances of fragment ions in APCI mass spectra. Results obtained from HPLC/MS analyses are supported by validated GC/FID analyses of fatty acid methyl esters after the transesterification. The total content of Delta5-UPIFAs is about 32% for European Larch, 27% for Norway Spruce and 20% for European Silver Fir. In total, 20 FAs with acyl chain lengths from 16 to 24 carbon atoms and from 0 to 3 double bonds have been identified in 64 triacylglycerols from 3 conifer seed oils.	larix decidua triacylglycerols
1	Composition of essential oils from seeds of Abies koreana.The essential oils from seeds of nine Abies koreana specimens have been studied using GC-MS-FID and NMR methods, leading to the determination of 96 volatiles, which constituted over 99% of the oils. The hydrodistilled oils of fresh, resinous scent were isolated with yields in the range of 3.8-8.5%. The results showed that the essential oil of Korean fir seeds contained 70-95% monoterpenes and 1-20% oxygenated monoterpenes as the dominant groups. The numerous sesquiterpenes, diterpenes and their oxygenated derivatives constituted only 2-8% of the oil. The major component of the seed essential oil was limonene (41-72 g/100g); the laevorotary form of this terpene predominated. A. koreana seeds seem to be a rich source of both essential oil and (-)-limonene, whose average enantiomeric excess was above 95%.	a. koreana monoterpenes
2	Chinese herbal medicine for insomnia: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials.Chinese herbal medicine (CHM), either in single herb or in herbal formula, has been used to treat insomnia for more than 2000 years. A systematic review including Chinese and English literature of randomized controlled trials was conducted to examine the efficacy, safety, and composition of CHM for insomnia. Among the 217 studies we have reviewed, only eight had a Jadad score &gt;=3, and seven out of these eight studies had at least one domain with high risks of bias. Meta-analyses of the studies with Jadad score &gt;=3 found that CHM was similar to Western medication (three studies) and placebo (three studies) in treating insomnia. Due to the poor methodological quality of the studies and the small number of trials included in meta-analyses, the current evidence is insufficient to support the efficacy of CHM for insomnia. The frequency of adverse events associated with CHM was similar to that of placebo, but lower than with Western medication. Gui Pi Tang was the most commonly used standardized formula, while Suan Zao Ren (Ziziphus jujuba) was the most frequently used single herb. Further studies with a double-blind placebo-controlled design are needed to accurately determine the benefits and risks of CHM for insomnia.	ziziphus jujuba insomnia
4	Differential antiproliferation effect of 2'-benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde in K-ras-transformed cells via downregulation of thiol antioxidants.2'-Benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde (BCA), one of the derivatives of 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (HCA) isolated from the bark of Cinnamomum cassia, induces apoptosis in human cancer cells. We found that BCA induces stronger antiproliferative effects in K-ras-transformed cells (RK3E-ras) than in isogenic non-transformed cells (RK3E). Treatment of RK3E-ras with BCA resulted in increased ROS generation and depletion of intracellular glutathione, whereas BCA-treated RK3E showed no significant increase in the ROS level with concurrent increase in intracellular glutathione (GSH). Thiol antioxidants recovered cell proliferation inhibition caused by BCA in both cell lines, while non-thiol antioxidants failed to recover cell death. BCA decreased metallothionein (MT) expression in RK3E-ras, while inducing remarkable MT expression in RK3E. The increase of intracellular GSH in RK3E is partially caused by differential induction of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS) due to BCA treatment. To evaluate the upstream pathway for differential expression of gamma-GCS and MT, we analyzed early DJ-1 (PARK7) and NF-E2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) changes after BCA treatment. In RK3E, DJ-1 expression considerably increased for 3 h with concurrent induction of Nrf2, whereas in RK3E-ras cells BCA decreased these protein levels. Based on these findings, it seems that the therapeutic selectivity of BCA in RK3E-ras results from decreased thiol antioxidants via decreased DJ-1 and Nrf2 expression.	gamma-GCS cancer

2	Pharmacognostic specification of Zanthoxylum limonella (Dennst.) Alston: Fruits and seeds in Thailand.Zanthoxylum limonella (Dennst.) Alston. (Rutaceae) or Ma-khwaen is one of the medicinal plants in Thai traditional medicine. To investigate the pharmacognostic specifications and chemical constituents of Z. limonella fruits and seeds. Fruits and seeds of Z. limonella were collected from 15 sources throughout Thailand; then examined the pharmacognostic specification following WHO guideline of quality control method for medicinal plant materials. Microscopic determination of Z. limonella powders demonstrated fragment of mesocarp, fragment of brown vitta, oil glands, fragment of endocarp, and endosperm containing oil globule, trichome and pale brown stone cells. Stomatal index and pellucid dots in mm2 were 19.87 and 4.2 respectively. Physico-chemical parameters unveiled that loss on drying, water content, total ash, and acid-insoluble ash should be not &gt;17.90%, 9.18%, 4.50%, and 0.60% of dried weight respectively; while ethanol, water, and hexane extractive values and volatile oil content should be not &lt;2.24%, 2.27%, 1.57% and 9.63% of dried weight respectively. Rf values of thin-layer chromatographic fingerprint of Z. limonella fruits and seeds ethanolic extract were 0.38, 0.45, 0.90, and 0.97 detected ultraviolet (UV) light 254 nm, 0.30, 0.44, 0.67, and 0.77 detected UV light 366 nm, and 0.24, 0.73, 0.78, and 0.93 detected 10% sulfuric acid. There are three main chemical compounds in Z. limonella oil including limonene (43.63%), (+)-sabinene (16.72%), and terpinen-4-ol (10.95%). The result gained from pharmacognostic specifications and chemical fingerprints could be used as standardization data of Z. limonella fruits and seeds to apply or provide for guarantee of quality.	z. limonella limonene
0	Cinnamaldehyde affects the biological behavior of human colorectal cancer cells and induces apoptosis via inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.Cinnamaldehyde (CA) is a bioactive compound isolated from the stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia, that has been identified as an antiproliferative substance with pro-apoptotic effects on various cancer cell lines in vitro. In the present study, the effects of CA on human colon cancer cells were investigated at both the molecular and cellular levels. Three types of colorectal cancer cells at various stages of differentiation and invasive ability (SW480, HCT116 and LoVo) were treated with CA at final concentrations of 20, 40 and 80 microg/ml for 24 h. Compared with the control group, the proliferation inhibition rate of the human colorectal cancer cells following treatment with CA increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The invasion and adhesion abilities of the cells were significantly inhibited as indicated by Transwell and cell-matrix adhesion assays. Meanwhile, CA also upregulated the expression of E-cadherin and downregulated the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9. CA also elevated the apoptotic rate. The levels of pro-apoptotic genes were upregulated while the levels of apoptosis inhibitory genes were decreased which further confirmed the pro-apoptotic effect of CA. In order to explore the mechanism of CA-induced apoptosis, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) were used to regulate the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway. The transcription activity of PI3K/AKT was markedly inhibited by CA, as well as IGF-1 which functions as an anti-apoptotic factor. In conclusion, CA has the potential to be developed as a new antitumor drug. The mechanisms of action involve the regulation of expression of genes involved in apoptosis, invasion and adhesion via inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.	Cinnamaldehyde Akt
1	Feeding deterrents from Zanthoxylum schinifolium against two stored-product insects.Screening for insecticidal principles from several Chinese medicinal herbs showed that the fruit pericarp of Zanthoxylum schinifolium possessed significant feeding deterrence against two stored-product insects (Tribolium castaneum and Sitophilus zeamais). From the methanol extract, two feeding deterrents were isolated by bioassay-guided fractionation. The compounds were identified as schinifoline and skimmianine from their spectroscopic data. Schinifoline has feeding deterrent activity against T. castaneum and S. zeamais adults with EC(50) values of 47.8 and 85.6 ppm respectively. Skimmianine possess feeding deterrent activity against T. castaneum and S. zeamais adults with EC(50) values of 75.7 and 129.7 ppm respectively.	zanthoxylum schinifolium Skimmianine
1	Cinnamon and Chronic Diseases.Cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum and Cinnamon cassia), the eternal tree of tropical medicine, belongs to the Lauraceae family and is one of the most important spices used daily by people all over the world. It contains a lot of manganese, iron, dietary fiber, and calcium. Cinnamon contains derivatives, such as cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid, cinnamate, and numerous other components such as polyphenols and antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, anticancer effects. Several reports have dealt with the numerous properties of cinnamon in the forms of bark, essential oils, bark powder, and phenolic compounds, and each of these properties can play a key role in human health. Recently, many trials have explored the beneficial effects of cinnamon in Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, arthritis, and arteriosclerosis, but still we need further investigations to provide additional clinical evidence for this spice against cancer and inflammatory, cardioprotective, and neurological disorders.	cinnamon cinnamic acid
3	Acute demyelinating encephalitis after jequirity pea ingestion (Abrus precatorius).INTRODUCTION: Castor and jequirity beans are uncommon causes of poisoning. The more common but less severe castor poisoning is well described, but jequirity bean (Abrus Precatorius) poisoning is rare. The toxicity is attributed to toxalbumins (ricin and abrin) that act by inhibiting protein synthesis. Their use as agents of biological warfare, mechanisms of action, and clinical features of poisoning are summarized. CASE REPORT: A 30-year-old previously healthy female presented with bloody diarrhea and deep coma following ingestion of 3-4 seeds of a plant called 'ratti.' Investigations, including an MRI brain scan, showed evidence of acute demyelinating encephalitis. The patient died three days later due to progressive central nervous system depression. DISCUSSION: This is a previously unreported manifestation of jequirity bean poisoning. Demyelination is immune-mediated, and Abrus is a well-known immuno-modulator and stimulator. A possible immunological pathogenic mechanism is hypothesized.	toxalbumins Demyelination
1	Methylxanthines reversibly inhibit tracheary-element differentiation in suspension cultures of Zinnia elegans L.Tracheary-element (TE) differentiation in suspension-cultured mesophyll cells of Zinnia elegans L. was completely inhibited by caffeine and theophylline only when these methylxanthines were applied at least 8 h prior to the appearance of secondary cell-wall thickenings. In contrast, the calcium-channel blocker nifedipine completely inhibited TE differentiation when applied only 2-3 h prior to the onset of secondary cell-wall deposition. This indicates the involvement of a methylxanthine-inhibitable event in TE differentiation that is distinguishable from an event dependent on influx of extracellular calcium. The correlation between the time of appearance of chlorotetracycline fluorescence (an indicator of sequestered Ca(2+)) and loss of methylxanthine effectiveness indicates that inhibition by methylxanthines may result from release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores. Methylxanthines with high potencies against adenosine 3' : 5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) phosphodiesterase and adenosine receptors were less effective inhibitors of TE differentiation, indicating that inhibition of differentiation by methylxanthines is independent of cAMP metabolism. The role of cAMP in transduction of the cytokinin signal, which was proposed previously on the basis of stimulation of TE differentiation by theophylline, was investigated using the non-hydrolyzable analog 8-bromo-cAMP. Although 8-bromo-cAMP stimulated differentiation in the absence of inductive concentrations of cytokinin, the non-cyclic analog 8-bromo-AMP was even more effective, indicating that 8-bromo-cAMP behaves as a cytokinin analog, rather than a second messenger, in stimulating TE differentiation. 	zinnia elegans chlorotetracycline
2	Dietary Ziziphus jujuba Fruit Influence on Aberrant Crypt Formation and Blood Cells in Colitis-Associated Colorectal Cancer in Mice.Ziziphus jujuba (ZJ) fruit is rich in bioactive functional components such as polysaccharides, triterpenoid acid, flavonoids and oleamide. It has been commonly used in the treatment of various diseases including diabetes, digestive disorders, diarrhea, skin infections, liver and urinary complaints. However, dietary effects with regard to chemoprevention of colon cancer have not been studied. The present study was performed to evaluate the protective effects of dietary ZJ against colitis-associated colon carcinogenesis in azoxymethane (AOM)-dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)-treated mice. AOM was injected (10 mg/kg b.wt., i.p.) and three cycles of 2% DSS in drinking water for 7 days with 14 days of normal drinking water in-between were administered to induce colitis-associated colon cancer. ZJ fruit was supplemented into feed at levels of 5 and 10%. Dietary ZJ significantly attenuated aberrant crypt foci (ACF) formation and also decreased the progression of hyperplasia to dysplasia. In addition, it significantly reduced circulating white blood cells, lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils and platelets compared to colon cancer mice. We conclude that ZJ supplementation may delay the progression of colon cancer from hyperplasia to dysplasia and ultimately adenocarcinoma and cancer. In addition, it decreased circulating tumor-related leukocytes, main regulators of cancer inflammation. Dietary consumption of ZJ fruit attenuated the formation of ACF and delayed the progression of colon cancer. 	ziziphus jujuba colon cancer
1	A mild conversion of phenylpropropnoid into rare phenylbutanoids: (E)-4-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)but-1,3-diene and (E)-4-(2,4,5-trimethozypheny)but-1-ene occuring in Zingiber cassumunar.(E)-4-(2',4',5'-trimethoxyphenyl)but-1,3-diene (4) and (E)-4-(2',4',5'-trimethoxyphenyl)but-1-ene (6), bioactive phenylbutanoids of Zingiber cassumunar, were synthesized exclusively with trans geometry. Treatment of methylmagnesium iodide with (E)-2',4',5'-trimethoxycinnamaldehyde (2), an oxidized product of abundantly available toxic (Z)-phenylpropanoid (1) of Acorus calamus, gave (E)-4-(2',4',5'-trimethoxyphenyl)but-3-en-2-ol (3) which upon dehydration with copper sulphate/silica gel under microwave irradiation for 3 min afforded 4 in 58% yield. Further, catalytic hydrogenation of 4 with 10% Pd/C afforded 4-(2',4',5'-trimethoxyphenyl)butane (5) which upon dehydrogenation with DDQ/SiO2 afforded hypolipidemic 6 in 54% yield.	zingiber cassumunar (E)-4-(2,4,5-trimethozypheny)but-1-ene
1	Comparative analysis of chemical compositions and antimicrobial activities of essential oils from Abies holophylla and Abies koreana activities of essential oils from Abies holophylla and Abies koreana.The chemical compositions and antibacterial and antifungal activities of essential oils extracted from Abies holophylla and A. koreana were investigated. GC-MS analysis revealed that 38 compounds comprised 95.88% of the A. holophylla essential oil, with the main components being bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-ol (28.05%), delta3-carene (13.85%), alpha-pinene (11.68%), camphene (10.41%), dl-limonene (7.61%), beta-myrcene (7.11%), trans-caryophyllene (5.36%), and alpha- bisabolol (3.67%). In the essential oil from A. koreana, 36 compounds comprised 98.67% of the oil, and the main compounds were bornyl ester (41.79%), camphene (15.31%), alpha-pinene (11.19%), dl-limonene (8.58%), fenchyl acetate (5.55%), and alpha-terpinene (2.29%). Both essential oils showed great potential of antibacterial activity against several bacteria tested, in the range of 2.2-8.8 mug per disc by the agar disc diffusion method, and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 5.5-21.8 mg/ml by the microdilution method. Both oils showed very effective antifungal activities toward all pathogenic strains tested, including Candida glabrata, with MIC values in the range of 0.5-2.2 mg/ml. As a whole, A.koreanaoil showed better antibacterial and antifungal properties than A.holophylla oil.	a. koreana alpha-terpinene
1	In vitro activities of plant extracts on human Loa loa isolates and cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells.Loa loa, a filarial worm, can cause fatal encephalitis in humans. In an attempt to find alternatives to the standard treatments (ivermectin and diethylcarbamazine citrate), we tested 12 methanolic extracts of nine traditional plant remedies. The extracts (100-0.09 microg/ml) were incubated with 20 Loa loa microfilariae isolated from patients at 37 degrees C with 5% CO(2) in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal serum and antibiotics. Activity was evaluated 120 h later by counting live microfilariae under a microscope. Cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells was estimated by measuring 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2-5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide transformation to formazan at 450 nM in a spectrophotometer. The plants tested were Lophira alata, Greenwayodendron suaveolens, Uapaca togoensis, Zanthoxylum heitzii, Peperomia pellucida, Piptadeniastrum africanum, Petersianthus macrocarpus, Vernonia conferta, and Vernonia hymenolepis. Chemical screening showed that most of the extracts contained reducing sugars, tannin or polyphenols, sterols or triterpenes, saponosides, and alkaloids. None contained carotinoids and few contained flavonoids. The 50% lethal concentration ranged from 0.22 to 70.28 microg/ml, while the 50% inhibitory concentration for eukaryotic cells (IC(50)) ranged from 8.52 to 119.52 microg/ml. Extracts of P. macrocarpus (selectivity index = 72.16), P. africanum (13.69), Z. heitzii (12.11), and L. alata (9.26) were highly selective for L. loa.	p. macrocarpus polyphenols
1	Four new phenolic glycosides from Baoyuan decoction.Four new phenolic glycosides, including two flavonoid glycosides (1 and 2) and two lignan glycosides (3 and 4), were isolated from the traditional Chinese medicine formula, Baoyuan decoction. Their structures were established by detailed analysis of the NMR and HR-ESI-MS spectroscopic data and their absolute configurations were determined by the experimental electronic circular dichroism data as well as chemical methods. Furthermore, the sources of the four new compounds were determined by the UPLC-Qtrap-MS method, which proved that 1 and 2 are originated from Glycyrrhiza uralensis, and 3 and 4 are from Cinnamomum cassia.	cinnamomum cassia lignan glycosides

(1) and threo-3-methoxy-5-hydroxy-phenylpropanetriol-8-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (2), were isolated from the stems of Zanthoxylum armatum. The compounds 1 and 2 showed weak scavenging activity in DPPH free radical assay with IC50 values of 323 and 114 mM, respectively.	zanthoxylum armatum glycosides
1	Purification, structural characterization, and hypolipidemic effects of a neutral polysaccharide from Ziziphus Jujuba cv. Muzao.A neutral polysaccharide (PZMP1) with a molecular weight of 16.97 kDa was isolated from Ziziphus Jujuba cv. Muzao with water extraction, ethanol precipitation, and purification with DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow and Sephacryl S-300 column chromatography. PZMP1 was structurally characterized with high-performance gel-permeation chromatography, gas chromatography, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, methylation analysis, NMR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. The results show that PZMP1 is a homogeneous heteropolysaccharide composed of arabinose, galactose, glucose, mannose, and xylose in a molar percentage of 17.36: 3.29:2.68:1.05:1.00. The majorly backbone of PZMP1 is composed of 1,3,5-linked Araf, 1,3-linked Araf, 1,5-linked Araf, 1,4-linked Glcp, and 1-linked Araf, 1-linked Glcp. According to an NMR analysis, the repeating unit of PZMP1 is a linear backbone with branches at positions O-3, and O-5. PZMP1 also displays effective dose-dependent hypolipidemic activity, suggesting that it is a natural hypolipidemic agent, which could contribute to the functional food qualities of jujube fruit.	jujube arabinose
1	Anti-inflammatory activity of compounds isolated from the aerial parts of Abrus precatorius (Fabaceae).Two triterpenoid saponins 1 and 2 isolated from the aerial parts of Abrus precatorius and their acetates derivatives, 3 and 4 have been tested for anti-inflammatory activity using the croton oil ear model. All the compounds exhibited anti-inflammatory activity but the acetates showed greater inhibition than the parent compounds.	abrus precatorius saponins
2	From type 2 diabetes to antioxidant activity: a systematic review of the safety and efficacy of common and cassia cinnamon bark.Common (Cinnamomum verum, C. zeylanicum) and cassia (C. aromaticum) cinnamon have a long history of use as spices and flavouring agents. A number of pharmacological and clinical effects have been observed with their use. The objective of this study was to systematically review the scientific literature for preclinical and clinical evidence of safety, efficacy, and pharmacological activity of common and cassia cinnamon. Using the principles of evidence-based practice, we searched 9 electronic databases and compiled data according to the grade of evidence found. One pharmacological study on antioxidant activity and 7 clinical studies on various medical conditions were reported in the scientific literature including type 2 diabetes (3), Helicobacter pylori infection (1), activation of olfactory cortex of the brain (1), oral candidiasis in HIV (1), and chronic salmonellosis (1). Two of 3 randomized clinical trials on type 2 diabetes provided strong scientific evidence that cassia cinnamon demonstrates a therapeutic effect in reducing fasting blood glucose by 10.3%-29%; the third clinical trial did not observe this effect. Cassia cinnamon, however, did not have an effect at lowering glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c). One randomized clinical trial reported that cassia cinnamon lowered total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides; the other 2 trials, however, did not observe this effect. There was good scientific evidence that a species of cinnamon was not effective at eradicating H. pylori infection. Common cinnamon showed weak to very weak evidence of efficacy in treating oral candidiasis in HIV patients and chronic salmonellosis.	cinnamon helicobacter pylori infection
2	Inhibitory effect of phytoglycoprotein (24kDa) on allergy-related factors in compound 48/80-induced mast cells in vivo and in vitro.Mast cells are involved in immediate allergic reactions such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis. Allergic reactions caused by extracellular allergens such as xenobiotics may become a critical problem in living circumstances. Recently, we isolated and purified glycoprotein from Zanthoxylum piperitum DC fruit (ZPDC), and demonstrated that ZPDC glycoprotein (5-20mg/kg, 25-100mug/ml) has an inhibitory effect on allergy-related mediators in the compound 48/80-treated BALB/c and human mast cells (HMC-1 cells). Our results obtained from this study showed that ZPDC glycoprotein (10mg/kg) inhibited interleukin-4 (IL-4), immunoglobulin E (IgE), and histamine are released in mouse serum. Also, ZPDC glycoprotein (50mug/ml) attenuated the degranulation of mast cells, intracellular Ca(2+) levels, and the activities of phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB (p50 and p65), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the HMC-1 cells. Taken together, we speculate that the ZPDC glycoprotein might be one component found in natural products that has the ability to prevent dysfunction in the immune system caused by several different allergens.	zanthoxylum piperitum asthma
2	Effect of long-term administration of Cinnamomum cassia silver nanoparticles on organs (kidneys and liver) of Sprague-Dawley rats.This study investigated the toxic effects of silver on the kidneys and livers of Sprague-Dawley rats after administering multiple doses of silver nanoparticles synthesized using extracts of Cinnamomum cassia (CcAgNPs). Twenty-four Sprague-Dawley rats (250 +- 20 g) were randomly assigned to four groups (A-D) of six animals per group and treated for 8 weeks. Group A was administered 200 mg/kg of Cinnamon Cassia extract (Cc), group B 5 mg/kg of CcAgNPs, group C 10 mg/kg of CcAgNPs, and group D normal saline. Body weight was measured weekly and fasting blood glucose was measured fortnightly. At the end of the experiment, animals were euthanized and organs (livers and kidneys) were fixed in neutral buffered formalin and processed for light microscopy (H&amp;E). Body weight differences were significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) in the low-dose Cc group and the kidney to body weight ratio was not significant. Renal function analysis of proteins and ketones showed a significant increase in CcAgNP-treated rats (P &lt; 0.05). Kidney and liver histology showed distortions in hepatocytes and sinusoidal linings with infiltrations especially in the higher dose groups. Kidney histology mirrored degenerative changes in glomerular and Bowman's capsules with bfirillary mesangial interstitium. CcAgNPs impairs renal and hepatic morphology and function after a long period of administration.	cinnamomum cassia impairs renal and hepatic morphology
1	Dihydrobenzo[c]phenanthridine alkaloids from stem bark of Zanthoxylum nitidum.Five novel alkaloids, zanthomuurolanine ( 1), epi-zanthomuurolanine ( 2), zanthocadinanines A ( 3) and B ( 4), and epi-zanthocadinanine B ( 5), composed of dihydrochelerythrine and a cadinane-type sesquiterpene linked by a methylene bridge, have been isolated from stem bark of Zanthoxylum nitidum. These structures were elucidated by spectroscopic techniques (UV, IR, MS, CD, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, DEPT, COSY, NOESY, HSQC, and HMBC analyses). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies confirmed the relative configurations of 1 and 4 and provided additional support for the structures of 2, 3, and 5.	zanthoxylum nitidum zanthocadinanines a
1	Components and insecticidal activity against the maize weevils of Zanthoxylum schinifolium fruits and leaves.In our screening program for new agrochemicals from Chinese medicinal herbs and wild plants, Zanthoxylum schinifolium essential oils were found to possess strong insecticidal activity against the maize weevil Sitophilus zeamais. The essential oils of Z. schinifolium fruits and leaves were extracted via hydrodistillation and investigated by GC and GC-MS. Estragole (69.52%) was the major compound of the essential oil of fresh fruits, followed by linalool (8.63%) and limonene (4.34%) and 94.33% of the total components were monoterpenoids. The main components of the essential oil of fresh leaves were linalool (12.94%), ar-tumerone (8.95%), limonene (6.45%) and elixene (5.43%) and only 50.62% were monoterpenoids. However, the essential oil from purchased fruits contained linalool (33.42%), limonene (13.66%) and sabinene (5.72%), followed by estragole (4.67%), nerol (4.56%) and 4-terpineol (4.27%). Estragole, linalool and sabinene were separated and purified by silica gel column chromatography and preparative thin layer chromatography, and further identified by means of physicochemical and spectrometric analysis. The essential oil from the fresh fruits (LD50 = 15.93 mug/adult) possessed two times more toxicity to the insects compared with that of fresh leaves (LD50 = 35.31 mug/adult). Estragole, linalool and sabinene exhibited contact activity against S. zeamais with LD50 values of 17.63, 13.90 and 23.98 mug/adult, respectively. The essential oils of Z. schinifolium possessed strong fumigant toxicity against S. zeamais adults with LC50 values of 13.19 mg/L (fresh fruits), 24.04 mg/L (fresh leaves) and 17.63 mg/L (purchased fruits). Estragole, linalool and sabinene also exhibited strong fumigant toxicity against the maize weevils with LC50 values of 14.10, 10.46 and 9.12 mg/L, respectively.	z. schinifolium limonene
1	Isolation of substances with antiproliferative and apoptosis-inducing activities against leukemia cells from the leaves of Zanthoxylum ailanthoides Sieb. &amp; Zucc.Extraction of the leaves of Zanthoxylum ailanthoides Sieb. &amp; Zucc. affords extracts and four isolated compounds which exhibit activities against leukemia cells. The chloroform-soluble fraction (ZAC) of the crude extract of this plant showed cytotoxic activity against human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) and myelomonocytic leukemia (WEHI-3) cells with IC(50) values of 73.06 and 42.22 mug/mL, respectively. The active ZAC was further separated to yield pheophorbide-a methyl ester (1), pheophorbide-b methyl ester (2), 13(2)-hydroxyl (13(2)-S) pheophorbide-a methyl ester (3) and 13(2)-hydroxyl (13(2)-R) pheophorbide-b methyl ester (4) whose structures were confirmed by spectroscopic methods. Compounds 2-4 showed cytotoxic activities against both leukemia cells with IC(50) value in the range of 46.76-79.43 nM, whereas compound 1 exhibited only weak cytotoxic activity. The extracts and compounds 1-4 also induced apoptosis and DNA damage in leukemia cells after treatment. The results suggested that the Z. ailanthoides is biologically active against leukemia cells.	z. ailanthoides 13(2)-s) pheophorbide-a methyl ester
1	Antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities of ethyl acetate fraction from Zanthoxylum armatum in mice.Zanthoxylum armatum DC. is a traditional Chinese medicine that is prescribed to alleviate pain and treat inflammatory disorders. This species is distributed mainly in the southeast and southwest regions of China. In the present study, we found that ethyl acetate fraction of ethanolic extract of Z. armatum could significantly decrease acetic acid-induced writhing numbers, and suppress formalin induced licking times in the first phase at the highest dose and in the second phase at all tested doses. This observation revealed that Z. armatum extract possessed powerful antinociceptive activity. The mechanisms of the antinociceptive effect might be mainly involved in the periphery inflammatory analgesic. In addition, the ethyl acetate fraction also inhibited xylene-induced ear swelling in a dose-dependent manner in mice. Eight lignans [eudesmin, horsfieldin, fargesin, kobusin, sesamin, asarinin, planispine A, and pinoresinol-di-3,3-dimethylallyl] were identified as major components of the ethyl acetate fraction. Considering related studies reporting the anti-inflammatory activity for the identified lignans, lignan might be responsible for its anti-inflammatory activity. Our results confirm that the traditional use of Z. armatum in the treatment of inflammation and pain is warranted.	z. armatum lignan
2	How does traditional knowledge of Cassiae semen shed light on weight management? - A classical and modern literature review.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The seed of Senna obtusifolia (L.) H. S. Irwin & Barneby (Cassiae semen, CS) also known as Jue ming zi in China, has been traditionally used for weight management by purging the liver and improving the liver functions to support digestion. In the past decades, it has been used for hepatoprotection and treatment of overweight and other metabolic disorders such as hyperlipidaemia and diabetes. AIM OF THE REVIEW: This review aimed at providing comprehensive information on the traditional usages, pharmacology, phytochemistry and toxicology of CS and critically exploring its potential usage for clinical weight management from both traditional and modern application perspectives. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In order to fully understand the properties, actions and indications of CS, two sets of Chinese classical texts were searched, namely: Zhong Hua Yi Dian (Encyclopaedia of Traditional Chinese Medicine) and Zhong Guo Ben Cao Quan Shu (Complete Collection of Traditional Texts on Chinese Materia Medica). The purpose of studying these classical texts was to determine the traditional use of CS in weight management. Comprehensive searches were also performed on seven databases for publications on original randomised clinical trials (RCT), in vivo, in vitro or in silico studies related to pharmacological effects of CS. Detailed information about the phytochemistry of CS was collected from books, encyclopedia, online databases and journal literature. FINDINGS: In classical literature review, 89 classic texts provided information of properties, actions and indications of CS. In modern literature review, 44 studies were included for analysis, including 5 RCTs, 7 in vivo studies, 14 in vitro studies, 2 in silico studies and 16 studies of mixed types. Chinese classic literature has provided traditional evidence of the usage of CS for weight management. Contemporary studies have revealed that CS has weight loss effects and possesses some other pharmacological activities supporting weight management. Some chemical compounds of CS have been hypothesised to have a direct or indirect contribution to weight control. CONCLUSIONS: The relationships between chemical compounds and the corresponding weight-loss target proteins are not fully understood. Therefore, CS constituents should be further explored for the development of novel therapeutic or preventive agents for the treatment of overweight and obesity.	senna obtusifolia (l.) h. s. irwin & barneby metabolic disorders

1	Abrus precatorius Leaves: Antioxidant Activity in Food and Biological Systems, pH, and Temperature Stability.Natural antioxidants present in foods and other biological materials have attracted considerable interest because of their presumed safety and potential nutritional and therapeutic effects. Antioxidant constituents of plant materials act as radical scavengers and convert the radicals to less reactive species. Abrus precatorius (AP) was analyzed for its proximate and phytochemical composition. The leaves were extracted with methanol (ME) and analyzed for antioxidant activity by radical scavenging method, reducing power, ferric reducing capacity, and in vitro inhibition of Fenton's reagent-induced oxidation in oil emulsion and microsomes. In addition, the effect of temperature (100 C, 15, and 30 min) and pH (4.5, 7, and 9) C on the antioxidant activity of ME was investigated. The leaves were rich in total polyphenols, flavonoids, beta-carotene, glutathione, alpha-tocopherol, and ascorbic acid. The ME exhibited varying degree of antioxidant activity in a dose-dependent manner. The AP exhibited more inhibition of oxidation in microsomes (73%) than compared to oil emulsion (21%). Heat treatment resulted in an increase of radical scavenging activity of extract (28% to 43%). At pH 4.5 the extract exhibited more antioxidant activity and stability compared to pH 7 and 9. Data indicates that potential exists for the utilization of Abrus precatorius as a natural antioxidant. 	abrus precatorius flavonoids
2	Inhibitory effects of Zanthoxylum rhoifolium Lam. (Rutaceae) against the infection and infectivity of macrophages by Leishmania amazonensis.Zanthoxylum rhoifolium Lam. (Rutaceae) has been traditionally used in the treatment of microbial infections and parasitic diseases. In the present study, the antileishmanial effect induced by the ethanol extract of stem barks from Z. rhoifolium (ZR-EEtOH) and its n-hexane fraction (ZR-FHEX) on infection and infectivity of murine macrophages by promastigote forms of Leishmania amazonensis were investigated. In different set of experiments, macrophages or promastigotes were pretreated with ZR-EEtOH or ZR-FHEX at non-lethal concentrations for 24 hours, and then macrophages were submitted to infection by promastigotes. Moreover, their effects on activation of macrophages, as well as on the DNA content, size and number of promastigotes by flow cytometry were also evaluated. The infection rate and the number of internalized amastigote forms were markedly decreased after pretreatment of macrophages or promastigotes when compared with non-treated cells. The increase in phagocytic capability and nitrite content was also observed. Furthermore, the decrease of DNA content, size and number of promastigotes was also observed. In conclusion, ZR-EEtOH and ZR-FHEX promoted a markedly significant antileishmanial effect and reduction of infection of macrophages, probably underlying defense mechanisms activation in macrophages. These findings reinforce the potential application of Z. rhoifolium in the treatment of leishmaniasis.	z. rhoifolium leishmaniasis
4	Water extract of Cinnamomum cassia suppresses angiogenesis through inhibition of VEGF receptor 2 phosphorylation.Angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation, has been a major target for cancer therapy. Antiangiogenic herbal medicines are useful in the treatment of cancer. In this study, we found that a water extract of Cinnamomum cassia (CCWE) was a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis. In cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells, CCWE suppressed vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced proliferation, migration, invasion, tube formation, and intracellular signaling events such as phosphorylation of ERK, p38 and VEGFR2, and activation of matrix metalloproteinase. Furthermore, CCWE inhibited VEGF-induced vessel sprouting of rat aorta ex vivo. These findings might be of particular interest for drug development because VEGF signaling is a potential target for treatment of angiogenesis-associated diseases. 	VEGF cancer
1	Variability of phenolic and alkaloid content in different plant parts of Carissa edulis Vahl and Zanthoxylum chalybeum Engl.OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to investigate the relative abundance and effect of post-harvest treatment on total phenolics (TP) and total alkaloids in the leaves and bark of Carissa edulis and Zanthoxylum chalybeum, which would give an indication of the suitability of leaves as alternative sources of medicine in these plant species. RESULTS: Results indicated higher levels of total phenolics than total alkaloids in both of the species under both freezing and air drying conditions. While more alkaloids were found in leaves compared to bark, there was no difference in abundance of phenols between the plant parts of both species. Air drying preserved more TPs than freezing and the opposite was true for alkaloids. For sustainability, leaves are recommended as an alternative source of medicine instead of the preferred root or stem bark. However, the choice of whether to dry or freeze will depend on the specific compound of interest. Assessment of spatial variability of medicinal properties is highly recommended.	carissa edulis alkaloids
3	Isobutylhydroxyamides from the pericarp of Nepalese Zanthoxylum armatum inhibit NF1-defective tumor cell line growth.A neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-based bioassay-guided phytochemical investigation on Zanthoxylum armatum collected in Nepal led to the isolation of new timuramides A-D (1-4) and six known sanshools (5-10). The structures of all compounds were established by using modern spectroscopic techniques, including 1D and 2D NMR analysis and comparison with previously reported data. Most of the compounds inhibited growth of an Nf1- and p53-deficient mouse glioma cell line at noncytotoxic concentrations.	Isobutylhydroxyamides tumor
2	Survival after an intentional ingestion of crushed abrus seeds.Abrus precatorius seeds contain one of the most potent toxins known to man. However, because of the seed's outer hard coat the vast majority of ingestions cause only mild symptoms and typically results in complete recovery. If the seeds are crushed and then ingested, more serious toxicity, including death, can occur.We present a case of a man who survived an intentional ingestion of crushed Abrus seeds after he was treated with aggressive gastric decontamination and supportive care.	abrus precatorius toxicity
3	Improvement of insulin sensitivity in obese Zucker rats by myricetin extracted from Abelmoschus moschatus.In an attempt to develop new substances for treating insulin resistance, obese Zucker rats were employed to screen the effect of myricetin, an active principle of Abelmoschus moschatus (Malvaceae), on insulin resistance. Myricetin purified from the aerial portion of the plant was administered intravenously ( I. V.) into animals. A dose-dependent decrease in the plasma glucose concentration of obese Zucker rats was observed 30 min following an I. V. injection. Moreover, repeated I. V. injection of myricetin (1 mg/kg) into obese Zucker rats 3 times daily for 1 week reduced the value of the glucose-insulin index, an index of insulin resistance calculated from the areas under the curve of glucose and insulin during the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test. Additionally, repeated myricetin treatments overturned the inability of insulin to increase the expression of glucose transporter subtype 4 (GLUT 4) and to increase the protein levels and phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) in soleus muscle of these obese rats. The inability of insulin to increase expression of the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) and to promote Akt serine phosphorylation in soleus muscle of these rats were also overturned by repeated myricetin treatments. These findings indicate that myricetin improves insulin sensitivity through increased post-receptor insulin signaling mediated by enhancements in IRS-1-associated PI3-kinase and GLUT 4 activity in muscles of obese Zucker rats. Myricetin might be used as a model substance for the development of antidiabetic compounds.	Myricetin glucose-insulin

1	Involvement of tannins and flavonoids in the in vitro effects of Newbouldia laevis and Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides extracts on the exsheathment of third-stage infective larvae of gastrointestinal nematodes.The present study aimed at examining the possible role of tannins and flavonoids on the in vitro anthelmintic properties of the extracts of two plants from the southern area of Western Africa, i.e. Newbouldia laevis and Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides. Extracts of the two plants were prepared by use of acetone/water (70/30) and their anthelmintic activity was measured by use of the larval exsheathment inhibition assay (LEIA) applied on the abomasal species, Haemonchus contortus and the intestinal species Trichostrongylus colubriformis. Three concentrations of extracts were evaluated to examine the possible dose effect. In addition, the possible involvement of tannins and flavonoids was examined by comparing the levels of inhibition of larval exsheathment obtained with the same extracts, after of not addition of PVPP which forms complexes with these compounds. The results indicate significant effects with both plants and both nematode species. In the range of concentrations examined, the results were dose-dependent for N. laevis extracts but not for Z. zanthoxyloides because the three doses applied provoked a similar highly significant inhibition whatever the tested dose. The use of PVPP indicated for both plant and nematode species, that tannins and flavonoids are involved partly in the effect but that some other biochemical compounds were also involved in both plants.	z. zanthoxyloides flavonoids
2	Traditional Chinese herbal formula relieves snoring by modulating activities of upper airway related nerves in aged rats.Aim: The present study investigated whether intraperitoneal treatment with the herbal formula B210 ([B210]; a herbal composition of Gastrodia elata and Cinnamomum cassia) can reduce snoring in aged rats. Also, we studied possible neural mechanisms involved in B210 treatment and subsequent reduced snoring in rats. Methods and result: We compared pressure and frequency of snoring, activities of phrenic nerve (PNA), activities of recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLNA) and activities of hypoglossal nerve (HNA), inspiratory time (TI) and expiratory time (TE) of PNA, and pre-inspiratory time (Pre-TI) of HNA in aged rats between sham and B210 treatment groups (30 mg/mL dissolved in DMSO). We found that aged rats that received B210 treatment had significantly reduced pressure and frequency of snoring than rats who received sham treatment. Also, we observed that aged rats that received B210 treatment had significantly increased PNA, RLNA, and HNA, extended TI and TE of PNA, and prolonged Pre-TI of HNA compared to rats that received sham treatment. In other words, B210 treatment may relieve snoring through modulating activities and breathing time of upper airway related nerves in aged rats. Conclusion: We suggested that the B210 might be a potential herbal formula for snoring remission.	cinnamomum cassia hypoglossal nerve
2	Gastroprotective activity of Zanthoxylum rhoifolium Lam. in animal models.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The stem barks of Zanthoxylum rhoifolium Lam. (Rutaceae), locally known as "mamica de cadela", are popularly used in dyspepsies, stomachic, tonic, antitumoral, antipyretic and are used in treating flatulence and colic. The objective of this study was to evaluate the gastroprotective effect of the ethanolic extract of Zanthoxylum rhoifolium (EEZR) stem barks in acute gastric lesion models, investigating their possible mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice were used for the evaluation of the acute toxicity, and mice and rats to study the gastroprotective activity. The gastroprotective action of EEZR was analyzed in the absolute ethanol, HCl/ethanol and indomethacin-induced gastric lesion models in mice, hypothermic-restraint stress, and ischemia/reperfusion in rats. In the investigation of the gastroprotective mechanisms of EEZR, the participation of the NO-synthase pathway, ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K(ATP)), the levels of the non-protein sulfhydril groups (NP-SH) and the catalase activity using the ethanol-induced gastric mucosa lesion model and the quantification of the gastric mucus and the antisecretory activity through pylorus ligature model in rats were analyzed. RESULTS: The animals did not present any signs of acute toxicity for the EEZR (up to the 4 g/kg dose, po), and it was not possible to calculate the DL(50). EEZR (125-500 mg/kg) exhibited a significant gastroprotective effect in absolute ethanol, HCl/ethanol, hypothermic-restraint stress, and ischemia/reperfusion-induced gastric lesion models. EEZR (250 and 500 mg/kg) exhibited still a gastroprotective activity in the indomethacin-induced ulcer model. Gastroprotection of EEZR was significantly decreased in pre-treated mice with l-NAME or glibenclamide, the respective nitric oxide synthase and K(ATP) channels inhibitors. Our studies revealed that EEZR (500 mg/kg) prevented the decrease of the non-protein sulfhydril groups (NP-SH) and increased the catalase levels in ethanol-treated animals. Furthermore, the extract (500 mg/kg) significantly increased the mucus production, however, the gastric secretion parameters (volume, [H(+)], pH) did not show any alteration. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the ethanolic extract of Zanthoxylum rhoifolium exhibits a significant gastroprotection, because it inhibits the formation of gastric lesions using different models. The release of the nitric oxide, the opening of the K(ATP) channels, the participation of the non-protein sulfhydril groups (NP-SH), catalase and the increase of mucous secretion seem to be involved in the gastroprotection activity of the EEZR. Nevertheless, this activity does not seem to be related to antisecretory mechanisms.	zanthoxylum rhoifolium flatulence
1	6-Acetonyldihydrochelerythrine Is a Potent Inducer of Apoptosis in HCT116 and SW620 Colon Cancer Cells.6-Acetonyldihydrochelerythrine (1), a benzophenanthridine alkaloid, isolated from the methanol extract of Zanthoxylum capense, displayed potent cytotoxic activity in human HCT116 and SW620 colon carcinoma cells, to a higher extent than 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), the cornerstone chemotherapeutic agent in colon cancer. Cytotoxicity of 1 was evaluated by MTS, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and Guava ViaCount assays. Interestingly, 1 significantly induced cytotoxicity in both cell lines, leading to a significant increase in LDH release, as compared to 5-FU. Further, Guava ViaCount flow cytometry assays demonstrated that 1 significantly increased cell death, as shown by the presence of a significantly higher population of apoptotic cells in both cell lines, as compared to cells exposed to 5-FU. Furthermore, evaluation of nuclear morphology by Hoechst staining of 1-treated HCT116 and SW620 cells confirmed flow cytometry results, demonstrating a marked induction of apoptotic cell death by 1, again to a further extent than that elicited by 5-FU. In addition, immunoblot analysis to ascertain the molecular events triggered by 1 exposure was performed. The results show that 1 exposure reduced the steady-state expression and activation of the pro-survival proteins ERK5 and Akt and increased the steady-state expression of p53 in both HCT116 and SW620 cells. Changes in ERK5 or Akt activation can be ascertained by evaluating the ratio of p-ERK5/ERK5 or p-Akt/Akt. In addition, exposure to 1 reduced expression of XIAP, Bcl-XL, and Bcl-2, while increasing the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in both cell lines. Collectively, the data indicate that 6-acetonyldihydrochelerythrine (1) is a potent inducer of apoptosis in HCT116 and SW620 cell lines, highlighting its potential relevance in colon cancer. 	zanthoxylum capense 6-acetonyldihydrochelerythrine
1	Structural characterization of polysaccharides from Zizyphus jujuba and evaluation of antioxidant activity.Fruit of Zizyphus jujuba Mill, a traditional Chinese herb widely consumed in Asian countries, has been reported to possess several vital biological activities. This study intends to develop an appropriate analytical method for isolation of polysaccharides from Z. jujuba fruits and evaluate their antioxidant activity. Initially, powdered Z. jujuba fruits were subjected to hot water extraction, followed by ethanol precipitation, deproteination, dialysis and fractionation in a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column. One neutral polysaccharide fraction (ZJPN) and 3 acidic polysaccharide fractions (ZJPa1, ZJPa2 and ZJPa3) were isolated with the average MW ranging from 40,566 to 129,518 Da. GC analysis revealed that 6 monosaccharides, namely, rhamnose, arabinose, xylose, mannose, glucose and galactose were present in polysaccharide fractions. The galacturonic acid content in polysaccharide fractions followed the order: ZJPa3&gt;ZJPa2&gt;ZJPa1&gt;ZJPN. All the 4 polysaccharide fractions were found to be more effective in scavenging superoxide anions than hydroxyl radicals, while acidic polysaccharides showed a more pronounced effect in chelating ferrous ion.	z. jujuba galactose
1	Establishing in vitro Zinnia elegans cell suspension culture with high tracheary element differentiation.The Zinnia elegans mesophyll cell culture is a useful system for xylogenesis studies. The system is associated with highly synchronous tracheary element (TE) differentiation, making it more suitable for molecular studies requiring larger amounts of molecular isolates, such as mRNA and proteins and for studying cellulose synthesis. There is, however, the problem of non-uniformity and significant variations in the yields of TEs (%TE). One possible cause for this variability in the %TE could be the lack of a standardized experimental protocol in various research laboratories for establishing the Zinnia culture. Mesophyll cells isolated from the first true leaves of Z. elegans var Envy seedlings of approximately 14 days old were cultured in vitro and differentiated into TEs. The xylogenic culture medium was supplied with 1mg/l each of benzylaminopurine (BA) and alpha-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA). Application of this improved culture method resulted in stable and reproducible amounts of TE as high as 76% in the Zinnia culture. The increase was mainly due to conditioning of the mesophyll cell culture and adjustments of the phytohormonal balance in the cultures. Also, certain biochemical and cytological methods have been shown to reliably monitor progress of TE differentiation. We conclude that, with the adoption of current improvement in the xylogenic Z. elegans culture, higher amounts of tracheary elements can be produced. This successful outcome raises the potential of the Zinnia system as a suitable model for cellulose and xylogenesis research.	z. elegans cellulose
1	Phenolic content and antioxidant property of the bark extracts of Ziziphus mucronata Willd. subsp. mucronata Willd.BACKGROUND: Several plants traditionally used in treatment of a variety of infections in South Africa are reported in ethnobotanical surveys. Many of these plants including Ziziphus mucronata subsp. mucronata lack scientific reports to support their medicinal importance. METHODS: The antioxidant activities and phenolic contents of the acetone, ethanol and aqueous extracts of the stems of Z. mucronata subsp. mucronata were evaluated using in vitro standard methods. The total phenol, total flavonoids and proanthocyanidin content were determined spectrophotometrically. Quercetin, Tannic acid and catechin equivalents were used for these parameters. The antioxidant activities of the stem bark extracts of this plant were determined by ABTS, DPPH, and ferrous reducing antioxidant property (FRAP) methods. RESULTS: The quantity of the phenolic compounds, flavonoids and proanthocyanidins detected differ significantly in the various extracts. The phenolics were significantly higher than the flavonoids and proanthocyanidin contents in all the extracts investigated. The ferric reducing ability and the radical scavenging activities of the extracts were very high and dose-dependent. The ethanol extract had the highest antioxidant activity, followed by the acetone extract while the aqueous extract was the least active. Reacting with ABTS, the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were (0.0429 +- 0.04 mg/ml) for aqueous, (0.0317 +- 0.04 mg/ml) for acetone and (0.0306 +- 0.04 mg/ml) for ethanol extracts while they inhibited DPPH radical with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 0.0646 +- 0.02 mg/ml (aqueous), 0.0482 +- 0.02 mg/ml (acetone) and 0.0422 +- 0.03 mg/ml (ethanol). CONCLUSIONS: A correlation between the antioxidant activity and the total phenolic contents of the extracts indicated that phenolic compounds were the dominant contributors to the antioxidant activity of the plant. This study, therefore, demonstrated that Z. mucronata subsp. mucronata has strong antioxidant property and free radical scavenging capability.	z. mucronata subsp proanthocyanidin
2	Antioxidative effects of Cinnamomi cassiae and Rhodiola rosea extracts in liver of diabetic mice.Both Cinnamomi cassiae and Rhodiola rosea extracts are used as anti-diabetic folk medicines. Recently, increased oxidative stress was shown to play an important role in the etiology and pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus and its complications. This study was designed to examine the effects of Cinnamomi cassiae and Rhodiola rosea extracts on blood glucose, lipid peroxidation, the level of reduced glutathione and its related enzymes (glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase), and the activity of the antioxidant enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase) in the liver of db/db mice. Diabetic C57BL/Ks db/db mice were used as experimental models. Mice were divided into control (n=10), Cinnamomi cassiae (200 mg/kg/day, n=10), and Rhodiola rosea (200 mg/kg/day, n=10) treated groups for 12 weeks of treatment. These type II diabetic mice were used to investigate the effects of Cinnamomi cassiae and Rhodiola rosea on blood glucose, reduced glutathione, glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase, lipid peroxidation, catalase and superoxide dismutase. Cinnamomi cassiae and Rhodiola rosea extracts significantly decreased on blood glucose, increased levels of reduced glutathione and the activities of glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase in the liver. Extract treatment also significantly decreased lipid peroxidation. Cinnamomi cassiae and Rhodiola rosea extracts may be effective for correcting hyperglycemia and preventing diabetic complications.	rhodiola rosea hyperglycemia
3	A portable and chromogenic enzyme-based sensor for detection of abrin poisoning.A first of its kind portable, colorimetric detection system has been developed for the rapid diagnosis of abrin poisoning. Abrin, a natural biotoxin that is homologous to ricin yet more lethal, has high potential for becoming a weapon of bioterrorism given its ease of production. Using an immobilization strategy that implements non-natural amino acids for site-specific conjugation, we have created a reusable N-methyltryptophan oxidase based magnetic bead system that is capable of detecting L-abrine, a marker for abrin poisoning, at concentrations as low as 4 muM in mock urine. Furthermore, we propose that this detection strategy may be readily adaptable for sensing other targets of interest. This unique diagnostic test for abrin poisoning has demonstrated key benefits of portability and simple visual readout. These significant advantages can thus provide the potential for more rapid assessment and corresponding poison management if dedicated toxicology laboratories are not an option.	L-abrine poisoning
1	High-performance liquid chromatography--two wavelength detection of triterpenoid acids from the fruits of Ziziphus jujuba containing various cultivars in different regions and classification using chemometric analysis.A simple and sensitive HPLC-DAD method has been developed for the first time to simultaneously determine 10 triterpenoid acids (ceanothic acid, alphitolic acid, zizyberanal acid, zizyberanalic acid, epiceanothic acid, ceanothenic acid, betulinic acid, oleanolic acid, ursonic acid and zizyberenalic acid) in the dried fruit of Ziziphus jujuba (called Dazao) which has been widely used as one of the traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs). This HPLC assay was performed on a reversed-phase C(18) column (250 mm x 4.6mm, 5 microm) with the column temperature at 35 degrees C. The mobile phase was composed of A (acetonitrile) and B (0.05% aqueous phosphoric acid, v/v). The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min and the detection wave length was set at 205 nm for reference compounds 1-9 and 238 nm for reference compound 10. All calibration curves showed good linear regression (r(2)&gt;0.9999) within the test range. The established method showed good precision and accuracy with overall intra-day and inter-day variations of 0.43-1.72% and 0.53-2.45%, respectively, and overall recoveries of 94.98-104.09% for the 10 compounds analyzed. The validated method was successfully applied for the simultaneous determination of the 10 triterpenoid acids in 42 batches of Dazao which contained 36 cultivars from 22 cultivation regions, and were investigated and authenticated as Z. jujuba. Hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) and principal components analysis (PCA) were performed to differentiate and classify the samples based on the contents of the 10 triterpenoid acids. The presented HPLC-DAD method conjugated with chemometrics approach was demonstrated to be very helpful in using Dazao resources, and was possibly useful in chemotaxonomic characterization.	z. jujuba epiceanothic acid
2	Ultrastructural evaluation of the effects of cinnamon on the nervus ischiadicus in diabetic rats.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of oral cinnamon supplementation on the nervus ischiadicus at the electron microscopical level in rats. METHODS: This study was performed between 2004-2006 in Dicle University School of Medicine, Diyarbakir, Turkey in 15 adult Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats were divided into 3 groups; control (C) (n=5), diabetic without cinnamon (D) (n=5), and diabetic with cinnamon (D-C) (n=5). Diabetes was induced with intraperitoneal alloxan administration. All diabetic rats were treated with human insulin. All rats were fed with standard pellet chow. The D-C group rats were fed with standard pellet chow plus Cinnamomum cassia at the dose of 400mg/kg. All rats were sacrificed after 3 months and we obtained the nervus ischiadicus of all rats. Contrast stained thin sections evaluated by Jeol-TEM-1010 electron microscope, were not statistically different in both groups and photo samples were obtained. RESULTS: Mean blood glucose, hemoglobin A1C, and lipid profile were not statistically different in both groups. Marked detachment of myelin lamellae at Schmidt-Lanterman clefts, lysis in cristae mitochondrialis and degenerative changes, severe dispersion of organelles in neurolemma, mesoaxon region, and remarkable edema at the endoneurium were found in diabetic rats. On the contrary, mesoaxon, nucleus, nucleolus and myelin sheet were almost of normal appearance at the ultra-structural level in the D-C group. CONCLUSION: Cinnamon extracts may have beneficial effects on the development of diabetic neuropathy in alloxan induced diabetic rats.	Cinnamon diabetic neuropathy
1	Possible attenuation of nitric oxide expression in anti-inflammatory effect of Ziziphus jujuba in rat.The hydroalcoholic extract of fruits of Ziziphus jujuba (ZJ) was investigated for its anti-inflammatory effect using acute and chronic models of inflammation in rat. Wistar albino rats of either sex were employed in the present study (n = 6). Acute inflammation was induced by subplantar administration of carrageenan (1%) in rat hind paw. Chronic inflammation was induced by interscapular implantation of a sterile cotton pellet (50 mg). ZJ extract as test drug and indomethacin (10 mg/kg) as standard were used. Serum nitrite/nitrate was also estimated to determine the expression of nitric oxide. In the acute study, carrageenan (1%) administration caused marked paw edema. Pretreatment with ZJ extract exhibited marked dose-dependent attenuation in edema compared to control. In the chronic study, interscapular implantation of sterile cotton pellets caused significant granuloma formation after 7 days, serving as control. ZJ extract significantly decreased granuloma tissue formation compared to control. The serum nitrite/nitrate level was significantly increased after 7 days in the control group due to chronic inflammation, but was decreased by ZJ extract. Moreover, phytochemical studies indicated the presence of jujubosides, flavonoids and terpenes, which may produce the marked anti-inflammatory effect of ZJ fruit in acute and chronic inflammation, possibly by inhibiting nitric oxide expression. The study provides a scientific and ethnopharmacological rationale for the therapeutic use of ZJ fruit as an anti-inflammatory agent.	ziziphus jujuba flavonoids
2	Zanthoxylum usambarense (Engl.) Kokwaro (Rutaceae) extracts inhibit the growth of the breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, but not the brain tumour cell line U251 in vitro.Zanthoxylum usambarense (Engl.) Kokwaro has traditionally been used for the treatment of malaria, upper respiratory tract infections, cough, rheumatism, tooth decay and sore gums in Kenya and other African countries. Dried ground parts of Z. usambarense were extracted by maceration using methanol (MeOH) at room temperature, extract was dried and reconstituted in 70% aq. MeOH and partitioned against n-hexane and chloroform (CHCl3 ) to obtain MeOH, n-hexane and CHCl3 extracts. All extracts were assessed for cytotoxicity against two breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, and the brain tumour cell line U251 by the MTT assay. The free-radical scavenging activity of the extracts was also determined by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryhydrazyl (DPPH) assay. In the DPPH assay, the MeOH extract was found to be the most active free-radical scavenger with a RC50 value of 41.1 x 10(-3)  mg/mL. It also displayed significant cytotoxicity against the MCF-7 cell line (IC50 42.9 microg/mL) and appeared to have induced cell death through apoptosis. None of the test extracts showed any activity against the U251 cell line at test concentrations. The present findings demonstrated that Z. usambarense could be a potential source for new cytotoxic compounds for possible anticancer drug development.	z. usambarense malaria
1	Bioassay-guided studies on the cytotoxic and in vitro trypanocidal activities of a sesquiterpene (Muzigadial) derived from a Ugandan medicinal plant (Warburgia ugandensis).Trypanosomosis is arguably the most important disease of man and his domesticated animals in the tropics. There are few compounds available for its treatment. This has exacerbated the development of drug resistance. There is therefore urgent need to search for newer compounds to treat this important disease. Medicinal plants represent a potential source of the drugs. This paper reports a bioassay-guided study to search for possible biological activity (cytotoxic and trypanocidal) in two Ugandan medicinal plants. The methodology adopted was the so-called 'ping-pong' approach, involving phytochemical purification (column chromatography and preparative thin layer chromatography), alongside biological studies (cytotoxicity, antibacterial, trypanocidal and antifungal studies). Phytochemical investigations of Zanthoxylum chalybeum (seed) yielded a pure crystalline compound, 27-135D, which was characterized by 'HNMR as the alkaloid skimmianine. Studies on stem bark yielded three alkaloids 27-165A, 27-173A and 27-173B. All the above pure isolates, and the crude extracts of Z. chalybeum had neither biological activity nor cytotoxicity in the brine shrimp assay. A cytotoxic sesquiterpine, characterized as muzigadial, was isolated from W. ugandensis. It was highly toxic in the brine shrimp assay and also had in vitro trypanocidal activity against IL 3338 as well as IL1180; reference drug-resistant and drug-sensitive trypanosome strains respectively, comparable to diminazene aceturate and Geneticin (G418). Muzigadial also had antifungal activity against Candida albicans. It was concluded that the brine shrimp assay might be a useful predictor of trypanocidal activity of plant extracts and that muzigadial may be potentially valuable in the treatment of drug-resistant trypanosomosis.	z. chalybeum sesquiterpine
2	Immunomodulatory role of native and heat denatured agglutinin from Abrus precatorius.Lectins are known as polyclonal activators of lymphocytes and work through the induction of battery of cytokines, which vary from lectin to lectin. Most widely used biological response modifier Mistletoe lectin (ML-1) in therapy stimulates lymphocytes, macrophages, and natural killer cells and induces both TH1 and TH2 type cytokines. Abrus agglutinin, similar to ML-1 with respect to carbohydrate specificity [gal (beta1--&gt;3) gal/Nac], was studied both in native (NA) and heat denatured (HDA) condition for murine splenocyte proliferation, cytokine secretion, NK-cell activation, and thymocyte proliferation in vitro with a view to assess its potential as an immunomodulator. Both NA and HDA activate splenocytes and induce production of cytokines like IL-2, IFN-gamma and TNF-alphabeta indicating a TH1 type of immune response. Native agglutinin and HDA induced conditioned media of adherent splenocytes could stimulate non-adherent splenocytes and vice versa. Heat denatured agglutinin was able to induce NK-cell activation at much lower concentration than that of NA, but the extent of NK-cell activation was higher for NA. Proliferation of thymocytes by NA and HDA was also observed. This study indicates that Abrus agglutinin could be a potential immunomodulator both in native as well as in heat denatured form.	abrus precatorius Immunomodulatory
3	Stimulation of murine B and T lymphocytes by native and heat-denatured Abrus agglutinin.In our previous studies, Abrus agglutinin showed non-specific immunostimulatory activity both native (NA) and heat-denatured (HDA) condition in mouse model. The present study was investigated to decipher the specific immune response towards B and T cell by NA and HDA. It was observed that the proliferation index for NA and HDA of stimulated B cells are 1.35 and 1.41 respectively and on the other hand, T cell proliferation index for NA and HDA are 1.67 and 1.54 respectively. At the same time, expression of surface and activation marker for B and T cells was significantly different compared to control as quantified by flow cytometry. But the expression of co-stimulatory markers (CD 80 and CD 86) was not significantly different and NA and HDA in immunized splenocytes with Dalton's lymphoma antigen induced antibodies titer 4.37 and 4.2 times more than control. This study indicates Abrus agglutinin (NA and HDA) acts as a B cell and T cell stimulator.	abrus agglutinin lymphoma
2	In vitro antimalarial activity of medicinal plant extracts against Plasmodium falciparum.Malaria is a major global public health problem, and the alarming spread of drug resistance and limited number of effective drugs now available underline how important it is to discover new antimalarial compounds. In the present study, ten plants were extracted with ethyl acetate and methanol and tested for their antimalarial activity against chloroquine (CQ)-sensitive (3D7) and CQ-resistant (Dd2 and INDO) strains of Plasmodium falciparum in culture using the fluorescence-based SYBR Green assay. Plant extracts showed moderate to good antiparasitic effects. Promising antiplasmodial activity was found in the extracts from two plants, Phyllanthus emblica leaf 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) 3D7: 7.25 mug/mL (ethyl acetate extract), 3.125 mug/mL (methanol extract), and Syzygium aromaticum flower bud, IC50 3D7:13 mug/mL, (ethyl acetate extract) and 6.25 mug/mL (methanol extract). Moderate activity (30-75 mug/mL) was found in the ethyl acetate and methanol extracts of Abrus precatorius (seed) and Gloriosa superba (leaf); leaf ethyl acetate extracts of Annona squamosa and flower of Musa paradisiaca. The above mentioned plant extracts were also found to be active against CQ-resistant strains (Dd2 and INDO). Cytotoxicity study with P. emblica leaf and S. aromaticum flower bud, extracts showed good therapeutic indices. These results demonstrate that leaf ethyl acetate and methanol extracts of P. emblica and flower bud extract of S. aromaticum may serve as antimalarial agents even in their crude form. The isolation of compounds from P. emblica and S. aromaticum seems to be of special interest for further antimalarial studies.	s. aromaticum Cytotoxicity
2	Effect of the herbal medicine dai-kenchu-to on gastrointestinal motility in patients with megacystis-microcolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIHS) and chronic idiopathic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIIP): report of two cases.Dai-kenchu-to (DKT), a traditional Japanese herbal medicine (Kampo medicine), composed of zanthoxylum fruit, ginseng root, dried ginger rhizome and malt sugar, is clinically effective for postoperative ileus and chronic constipation. MMIHS and CIIP are severe motility disorder associated with high morbidity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of DKT on functional intestinal obstruction. DKT was clinically effective for gastrointestinal motility in a case with MMIHS, but not effective in one with CIIP. MMIHS and CIIP are speculated to have different pathogenesis regarding gastrointestinal pseudo-obstruction based upon the effect of this drug.	ginger gastrointestinal motility
1	Analysis of volatile components, fatty acids, and phytosterols of Abies koreana growing in Poland.Extracts and essential oils from seeds as well as essential oils from cone scales and needles with twigs of the Abies koreana population were studied. An analysis of Korean fir essential oils allowed us to determine 147 volatile compounds. The identified compounds constituted 97-99% of the seed, cone and needle oils. The main volatile in the seed and needle oils was limonene (56.6% and 23.4%, respectively), while the predominant volatile in cone oils was alpha-pinene (51.2%). Korean fir seeds provided a rich source of both essential oil (3.8-8.5%) and extract, which was isolated with a 24.5% yield and contained numerous groups of fatty acids and phytosterols (414 microg/100g extract). The most prominent fatty acids were unsaturated, among which linoleic (41.2%) and oleic (31.2%) fatty acid were the main ones while the dominant sterols were isomers of ergostadienol and beta-sitosterol. A. koreana seeds, cones and needles are a source of many volatile bioactive compounds while the seed extract, with a pleasant scent, contained not only volatiles, but also fractions rich in fatty acids and phytosterols. These facts make A. koreana essential oils and especially the seed extract potential components of cosmetics.	a. koreana limonene
1	Cinnamon: a multifaceted medicinal plant.Cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum, and Cinnamon cassia), the eternal tree of tropical medicine, belongs to the Lauraceae family. Cinnamon is one of the most important spices used daily by people all over the world. Cinnamon primarily contains vital oils and other derivatives, such as cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid, and cinnamate. In addition to being an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, anticancer, lipid-lowering, and cardiovascular-disease-lowering compound, cinnamon has also been reported to have activities against neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. This review illustrates the pharmacological prospective of cinnamon and its use in daily life. 	cinnamon cinnamic acid
2	Ziziphus jujuba extract for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation: a controlled clinical trial.PURPOSE: To investigate the safety and efficacy of an extract of Ziziphus jujuba for chronic constipation.Constipated patients received liquid Z. jujuba or placebo for 12 weeks. Subjects completed questionnaires, a visual analog scale and transit time (TT) tests before and after treatment. RESULTS: Of 37 patients with a prolonged TT, 18 received the study drug and 19 a placebo. Two (12%) of the study and 16 (84%) of the control group dropped out due to severe constipation. The TT decreased from 12.2 particles for the study group to 3 particles at week 11. Symptom severity ratings decreased from 6 and 6.2 to 2 and 5, and the quality of life score improved from 1.9 and 2.3 to 1.3 and 1.4 in the study and control groups, respectively. CONCLUSION: Z. jujuba extract is an effective and safe treatment for chronic constipation.	z. jujuba chronic constipation
1	[Absorption of flavonoids from Abelmoschus manihot extract by in situ intestinal perfusion].To explore the mechanism of the absorption of flavonoids from Abelmoschus manihot flowers, in situ intestinal recirculation was performed to study the effect of the absorption at different concentrations and different intestinal regions. To evaluate the conditions of the absorption of six flavonoids from Abelmoschus manihot flowers, the concentrations of Abelmoschus manihot in the perfusion solution were determined by HPLC at predesigned time. And we have investigated the inhibitory effect of six flavonoids from Abelmoschus manihot flowers on P-glycoprotein (P-gp) drug efflux pump. The results demonstrated that the absorption rates of flavonoids from Abelmoschus manihot flowers are not significantly different (P &gt; 0.05) at various drug concentrations, the absorption of flavonoids from Abelmoschus manihot flowers is a first-order process with the passive diffusion mechanism. The absorption rates of each of flavonoids are significantly different. The absorption rate of flavonoid glycoside was lower than that of aglycone; the flavonoids from Abelmoschus manihot flowers could be absorbed in all of the intestinal segments. The best parts of intestine to absorb hyperoside and myricetin are jejunum and duodenum, separately. Verapamil could enhance the absorption of isoquercitrin, hyperoside, myricetin and quercetin-3'-O-glucoside by inhibiting P-glycoprotein (P-gp) drug efflux pump.	abelmoschus manihot myricetin
1	Cinnamon and Chronic Diseases.Cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum and Cinnamon cassia), the eternal tree of tropical medicine, belongs to the Lauraceae family and is one of the most important spices used daily by people all over the world. It contains a lot of manganese, iron, dietary fiber, and calcium. Cinnamon contains derivatives, such as cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid, cinnamate, and numerous other components such as polyphenols and antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, anticancer effects. Several reports have dealt with the numerous properties of cinnamon in the forms of bark, essential oils, bark powder, and phenolic compounds, and each of these properties can play a key role in human health. Recently, many trials have explored the beneficial effects of cinnamon in Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, arthritis, and arteriosclerosis, but still we need further investigations to provide additional clinical evidence for this spice against cancer and inflammatory, cardioprotective, and neurological disorders.	cinnamon cinnamate
1	Cinnamaldehyde Inhibits the Function of Osteosarcoma by Suppressing the Wnt/beta-Catenin and PI3K/Akt Signaling Pathways.Background: Osteosarcoma (OS) is a primary bone tumor associated with locally aggressive growth and early metastatic potential that typically occurs in children and adolescents. Chinese traditional medicine Cinnamomum cassia Presl has been shown to have significant tumor-killing effect, in which cinnamaldehyde (CA) is the main active ingredient. Purpose: To explore the anticancer effect of CA on the osteosarcoma cells and the possible molecular mechanism. Methods: Crystal violet assay, MTT assay and colony-forming assay were used to confirm the inhibitory role of CA in the proliferation of 143B and MG63 osteosarcoma cells. Hoechst 33258 staining and flow cytometry were used to observe apoptosis. The migration and invasion role of OS cells were evaluated using transwell assays and wound healing assays. Western blotting was used to analyse the protein expression levels. Nude mice were inoculated with 143B cells to establish an orthotopic OS tumor animal model and to investigate the effects of CA on OS tumors. Results: According to crystal violet assay, MTT assay and colony-forming assay, CA significantly inhibited cell proliferation. Hoechst 33258 staining and flow cytometry analysis showed that CA-induced apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, transwell assays and wound healing assays showed that CA inhibited the migration and invasion of osteosarcoma cells. In vivo mouse models, CA inhibited the growth of osteosarcoma. The potential mechanisms could be that CA inhibited the transcriptional activity of Wnt/beta-catenin and PI3K/Akt of the osteosarcoma. Conclusion: CA may inhibit the proliferation, migration, invasion and promote apoptosis of OS cells by inhibiting Wnt/beta-catenin and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. CA may be a potentially effective anti-tumor drug.	cinnamomum cassia Cinnamaldehyde
2	Review: Diverse pharmacological properties of Cinnamomum cassia: A review.Cinnamomum cassia is widely utilized as a spice in different cookeries worldwide, especially in Asian cuisines. This herb is also being used in different forms of traditional medicine (Unani, Ayurvedic, Japanese and Chinese) for managing conditions like dyspepsia, peptic ulcer disease and ischemic brain injury. Recent studies have shown the scientific evidence for the medicinal use of this particular herb in several diseases like H. pylori infection, diabetes, brain ischemia and cancers. This article reviews the literature on potential benefits of the herb published within the last 10 years. The authors used Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms "Cinnamomum" with "cassia" or "arromaticum" to filter the PubMed database. To date, no systemic review focusing on medicinal use of C. cassia was found in the literature. Various research articles elucidating diverse pharmacological properties of C. cassia were identified. The standardised extract of C. cassia or the active compounds extracted from the herb might prove to be a novel candidate for early prevention and complimentary management of conditions like diabetes mellitus or H. pylori-associated disorders. 	c. cassia dyspepsia
2	Phytochemical profiles and biological activity evaluation of Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim seed against asthma in murine models.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim seed (ZBMS) has been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) as an ingredient of polyherbal formulations for the treatment of inflammation and asthma. The aim of this study was to analyze the major composition and to evaluate the anti-asthma activity of ZBMS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Some murine models including acetylcholine/histamine-induced asthma, ovalbumin-induced airway inflammation, ear edema and toe swelling measurement, citric acid-induced cough, and anti-stress abilities were investigated to fully study the anti-asthma activity of ZBMS.GC chromatography was also performed to analyze the major fatty acid composition of ZBMS. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that the major fatty acid composition of ZBMS includes oleic acid (20.15%), linoleic acid (26.54%), and alpha-linolenic acid (30.57%), which was the leading component of ZBMS, and that the total fatty acid content of ZBMS was 77.27%. The murine models demonstrated that ZBMS displays a protective effect on guinea pig sensitization, a dose-dependent inhibition of the increases in RL and decreases in Cdyn, which resulted in the relief of auricle edema and toe swelling in mice and anti-stress activity. CONCLUSION: Our results validate the traditional use of ZBMS for the treatment of asthma and other inflammatory joint disorders, and suggest that ZBMS has potential as a new therapeutic agent for asthma management.	zanthoxylum bungeanum maxim auricle edema
2	In vitro anti-Helicobacter pylori action of 30 Chinese herbal medicines used to treat ulcer diseases.Infection by Helicobacter pylori has been ascertained to be an important etiologic impetus leading usually to chronic active gastritis and gastric ulcer with growing incidences worldwide. Utilizing as the test pathogen a standard and five clinic strains of Helicobacter pylori, the antibacterial action was assessed in vitro with ethanol extracts of 30 Chinese herbal medicines which have been frequently prescribed since ancient times for treating gastritis-like disorders. Among the 30 tested materials, the ethanol extracts of Abrus cantoniensis (Fabaceae), Saussurea lappa (Asteraceae) and Eugenia caryophyllata (Myrtaceae) were strongly inhibitory to all test strains (MICs: approximately 40 microg/ml), and Hippophae rhamnoides (Elaeagnaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii (Liliaceae), Magnolia officinalis and Schisandra chinensis (Magnoliaceae), Corydalis yanhusuo (Papaveraceae), Citrus reticulata (Rutaceae), Bupleurum chinense and Ligusticum chuanxiong (Apiaceae) substantially active with MICs close to 60.0 microg/ml. As to antibacterial actions of the aqueous extracts of the same drugs, those derived from Cassia obtusifolia (Fabaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii and Eugenia caryophyllata were remarkably inhibitory against all the six Helicobacter pylori strains (MICs: approximately 60 microg/ml). The work compared almost quantitatively the magnitude of the anti-Helicobacter pylori actions of the 30 most prescribed gastritis-treating Chinese herbal drugs, and located as well some source plants where potent anti-Helicobacter pylori phytochemicals could be characterized.	corydalis yanhusuo ulcer diseases
2	Traditional medicine practices among community members with chronic kidney disease in northern Tanzania: an ethnomedical survey.BACKGROUND: In sub-Saharan Africa, chronic kidney disease (CKD) is being recognized as a non-communicable disease (NCD) with high morbidity and mortality. In countries like Tanzania, people access many sources, including traditional medicines, to meet their healthcare needs for NCDs, but little is known about traditional medicine practices among people with CKD. Therefore, we sought to characterize these practices among community members with CKD in northern Tanzania. METHODS: Between December 2013 and June 2014, we administered a previously-developed survey to a random sample of adult community-members from the Kilimanjaro Region; the survey was designed to measure traditional medicine practices such as types, frequencies, reasons, and modes. Participants were also tested for CKD, diabetes, hypertension, and HIV as part of the CKD-AFRiKA study. To identify traditional medicines used in the local treatment of kidney disease, we reviewed the qualitative sessions which had previously been conducted with key informants. RESULTS: We enrolled 481 adults of whom 57 (11.9 %) had CKD. The prevalence of traditional medicine use among adults with CKD was 70.3 % (95 % CI 50.0-84.9 %), and among those at risk for CKD (n = 147; 30.6 %), it was 49.0 % (95 % CI 33.1-65.0 %). Among adults with CKD, the prevalence of concurrent use of traditional medicine and biomedicine was 33.2 % (11.4-65.6 %). Symptomatic ailments (66.7 %; 95 % CI 17.3-54.3), malaria/febrile illnesses (64.0 %; 95 % CI 44.1-79.9), and chronic diseases (49.6 %; 95 % CI 28.6-70.6) were the most prevalent uses for traditional medicines. We identified five plant-based traditional medicines used for the treatment of kidney disease: Aloe vera, Commifora africana, Cymbopogon citrullus, Persea americana, and Zanthoxylum chalybeum. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of traditional medicine use is high among adults with and at risk for CKD in northern Tanzania where they use them for a variety of conditions including other NCDs. Additionally, many of these same people access biomedicine and traditional medicines concurrently. The traditional medicines used for the local treatment of kidney disease have a variety of activities, and people with CKD may be particularly vulnerable to adverse effects. Recognizing these traditional medicine practices will be important in shaping CKD treatment programs and public health policies aimed at addressing CKD.	persea americana kidney disease

Moreover, the recently reported structures 2'-4' of rhoifolines B and A, and '8-methoxynorchelerythrine', resp., isolated as new compounds from Z. rhoifolium and Z. nitidum, resp., could be assigned the revised structures 2-4 by reinvestigation of the spectroscopic data. In addition, the cytotoxicity of the isolates was evaluated on the MCF-7, NCI-H460, and SF-268 cell lines. Among these isolates, liriodenine (14) was the most active compound against the MCF-7, NCI-H460, and SF-268 cell lines with IC(50) values of 2.19, 2.38, and 3.19 microg/ml, resp.	z. nitidum 8-methoxynorchelerythrine
1	Influence of Binasal and Uninasal Inhalations of Essential Oil of Abies koreana Twigs on Electroencephalographic Activity of Human.Objectives. The present work investigates the effect of essential oil from the twigs of Abies koreana on electroencephalographic (EEG) activity of human brain in order to understand the influence of binasal and uninasal inhalations. Methods. To accomplish this study, the essential oil from the twigs of A. koreana (AEO) was isolated by steam distillation and the EEG readings were recorded using QEEG-8 system from 8 grounding electrodes according to the International 10-20 System. Results. D-Limonene (25.29%), bornyl acetate (19.31%), camphene (12.48%), alpha-pinene (11.88%), beta-pinene (6.45%), and eudesm-7(11)-en-ol (5.38%) were the major components in the essential oil. In the EEG study, the absolute alpha (left frontal and right parietal) and absolute fast alpha (right parietal) values significantly increased during the binasal inhalation of AEO. In the uninasal inhalation, absolute beta and theta values decreased significantly, especially in the right frontal and left and right parietal regions. The results revealed that the AEO produced different EEG power spectrum changes according to the nostril difference. Conclusion. The changes in EEG values due to the inhalation of AEO may contribute to the enhancement of relaxation (binasal inhalation) and alertness/attention (right uninasal inhalation) states of brain which could be used in aromatherapy treatments.	a. koreana bornyl acetate
4	Cinnamomum cassia Suppresses Caspase-9 through Stimulation of AKT1 in MCF-7 Cells but Not in MDA-MB-231 Cells.BACKGROUND: Cinnamomum cassia bark is a popular culinary spice used for flavoring and in traditional medicine. C. cassia extract (CE) induces apoptosis in many cell lines. In the present study, particular differences in the mechanism of the anti-proliferative property of C. cassia on two breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, were elucidated. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The hexane extract of C. cassia demonstrated high anti-proliferative activity against MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells (IC50, 34 +- 3.52 and 32.42 +- 0.37 mug/ml, respectively). Oxidative stress due to disruption of antioxidant enzyme (SOD, GPx and CAT) activity is suggested as the probable cause for apoptosis initiation. Though the main apoptosis pathway in both cell lines was found to be through caspase-8 activation, caspase-9 was also activated in MDA-MB-231 cells but suppressed in MCF-7 cells. Gene expression studies revealed that AKT1, the caspase-9 suppressor, was up-regulated in MCF-7 cells while down-regulated in MDA-MB-231 cells. Although, AKT1 protein expression in both cell lines was down-regulated, a steady increase in MCF-7 cells was observed after a sharp decrease of suppression of AKT1. Trans-cinnamaldehyde and coumarin were isolated and identified and found to be mainly responsible for the observed anti-proliferative activity of CE (Cinnamomum cassia). CONCLUSION: Activation of caspase-8 is reported for the first time to be involved as the main apoptosis pathway in breast cancer cell lines upon treatment with C. cassia. The double effects of C. cassia on AKT1 gene expression in MCF-7 cells is reported for the first time in this study.	AKT1 breast cancer
1	Isolation, solid-state structure determination, in silico and in vitro anticancer evaluation of an indole amino acid alkaloid L-Abrine .BACKGROUND: Abrus precatorius Linn. (Kunch in Bengali) is widely spread in tropical and sub-tropical regions. It is a typical plant species which is well-known simultaneously as folk medicine and for its toxicity. OBJECTIVE: Phytoceutical investigation of the white variety seeds of Abrus precatorius Linn. METHOD: Traditional extraction, separation, isolation, and purification processes were followed. The structure was elucidated by various spectral analyses and the solid-state structure of this indole-alkaloid has been determined by X-ray crystallographic analysis. Docking interactions of L-abrine have been studied against ten major proteins, responsible for various types of cancers. In silico studies were done by Schrodinger Maestro, AutoDock4, PyMOL and AutoDock Vina. The protein structures were downloaded from Protein Data Bank. Sulforhodamine B (SRB) colorimetric assay was used for in vitro anticancer evaluation against four human cancer cell lines. RESULTS: An indole-containing unusual amino acid alkaloid has been isolated from the white variety seeds of Abrus precatorius Linn. In silico docking studies demonstrated significant antiproliferative activity against four human cancer cell lines. CONCLUSION: The solid-state zwitterion structure of the indole-containing alkaloid (alpha-methylamino-beta-indolepropionic acid, L-abrine) has been confirmed for the first time by X-ray crystallography. Highly promising in silico and in vitro results indicate that L-abrine may find its space in future anticancer drug discovery research.	abrus precatorius L-abrine
3	Acute demyelinating encephalitis after jequirity pea ingestion (Abrus precatorius).INTRODUCTION: Castor and jequirity beans are uncommon causes of poisoning. The more common but less severe castor poisoning is well described, but jequirity bean (Abrus Precatorius) poisoning is rare. The toxicity is attributed to toxalbumins (ricin and abrin) that act by inhibiting protein synthesis. Their use as agents of biological warfare, mechanisms of action, and clinical features of poisoning are summarized. CASE REPORT: A 30-year-old previously healthy female presented with bloody diarrhea and deep coma following ingestion of 3-4 seeds of a plant called 'ratti.' Investigations, including an MRI brain scan, showed evidence of acute demyelinating encephalitis. The patient died three days later due to progressive central nervous system depression. DISCUSSION: This is a previously unreported manifestation of jequirity bean poisoning. Demyelination is immune-mediated, and Abrus is a well-known immuno-modulator and stimulator. A possible immunological pathogenic mechanism is hypothesized.	toxalbumins poisoning
2	Effective detoxification of Abrus precatorius Linn. seeds by Shodhana.Ayurveda, which is one of the traditional systems of medicine of India, reports the seeds of Abrus precatorius (family: Fabaceae) can be used therapeutically after shodhana process, which removes the toxin. The main objective was to scientifically study the shodhana process by evaluating the safety and efficacy of A. precatorius seeds. Aqueous extract (A1) and detoxified extract (A2) of the seeds were prepared by a process described in Ayurvedic pharmacopoeia. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) method was developed for the two extracts using different solvent systems. Identical spots were obtained in A1 with reference values (Rf) 0.27, 0.47, and 0.79, whereas A2 showed the absence of spot having Rf value 0.47, which could possibly be the toxin found in the intact seed. A1 and A2 were evaluated for their safety and efficacy. The acute toxicity studies for A1 and A2 revealed that A1 was toxic, whereas A2 was safe at the dose of 2 g/kg. Absence of toxicity in the detoxified extract suggests removal of toxic material in processed seeds. The results obtained for hair growth activity of both the extracts were comparable to that of the standard. However, A2 showed better results in comparison to A1. Thus, the shodhana process described in Ayurveda helps in removing the toxin, while retaining the efficacy at the same time. The statistical analysis was done using one-way analysis of variance. 	a. precatorius toxicity
1	Phenolic content and antioxidant property of the bark extracts of Ziziphus mucronata Willd. subsp. mucronata Willd.BACKGROUND: Several plants traditionally used in treatment of a variety of infections in South Africa are reported in ethnobotanical surveys. Many of these plants including Ziziphus mucronata subsp. mucronata lack scientific reports to support their medicinal importance. METHODS: The antioxidant activities and phenolic contents of the acetone, ethanol and aqueous extracts of the stems of Z. mucronata subsp. mucronata were evaluated using in vitro standard methods. The total phenol, total flavonoids and proanthocyanidin content were determined spectrophotometrically. Quercetin, Tannic acid and catechin equivalents were used for these parameters. The antioxidant activities of the stem bark extracts of this plant were determined by ABTS, DPPH, and ferrous reducing antioxidant property (FRAP) methods. RESULTS: The quantity of the phenolic compounds, flavonoids and proanthocyanidins detected differ significantly in the various extracts. The phenolics were significantly higher than the flavonoids and proanthocyanidin contents in all the extracts investigated. The ferric reducing ability and the radical scavenging activities of the extracts were very high and dose-dependent. The ethanol extract had the highest antioxidant activity, followed by the acetone extract while the aqueous extract was the least active. Reacting with ABTS, the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were (0.0429 +- 0.04 mg/ml) for aqueous, (0.0317 +- 0.04 mg/ml) for acetone and (0.0306 +- 0.04 mg/ml) for ethanol extracts while they inhibited DPPH radical with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 0.0646 +- 0.02 mg/ml (aqueous), 0.0482 +- 0.02 mg/ml (acetone) and 0.0422 +- 0.03 mg/ml (ethanol). CONCLUSIONS: A correlation between the antioxidant activity and the total phenolic contents of the extracts indicated that phenolic compounds were the dominant contributors to the antioxidant activity of the plant. This study, therefore, demonstrated that Z. mucronata subsp. mucronata has strong antioxidant property and free radical scavenging capability.	z. mucronata subsp catechin
1	Betaine distribution in the Malvaceae.Aerial parts of 26 taxa, distributed in 18 genera and all 5 tribes of the Malvaceae have been examined for the presence of betaines. Glycinebetaine was obtained in high yield (0.5-4.6%, dry weight) from all the plants studied, except Abelmoschus moschatus, in extracts of which glycinebetaine was not detected. Trigonelline was recorded for 16 of the plants tested, but the yields were low (0.005-0.07%, dry weight). Roots and flowers of a few of the species were also examined for betaines. The same compounds as those found in the aerial parts were usually detected, but the glycinebetaine contents of the roots and flowers were considerably lower.	abelmoschus moschatus glycinebetaine
2	Cassia cinnamon for the attenuation of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance resulting from sleep loss.Epidemiological investigations reveal a concomitant increase in sleep loss and metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, over the past several decades. An increasing body of scientific evidence indicates that acute sleep loss induces insulin resistance and glucose intolerance profiles similar to those of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. Experimentally, cassia cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia) supplementation facilitates glucose disposal in healthy humans, which may be achieved by enhancing (1) insulin sensitivity via increased phosphorylation of signaling proteins and (2) insulin-sensitive glucose transporter 4-mediated glucose uptake into muscle cells. Because peripheral insulin resistance is primarily a consequence of reduced muscle insulin sensitivity, C. cassia and C. cassia extracts may attenuate insulin resistance and glucose intolerance observed following sleep loss.	cinnamon metabolic diseases
2	Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology of Ziziphus jujuba Mills.Ziziphus jujuba Mills, 'annab' in Iran, 'ber' in India or 'pomme sourette' in France, is a species whose fruit (known warmly as 'the fruits of life' in China) has been consumed for centuries for its nutritional value. The food industry used it as a food additive and flavoring. The dry seeds, the crude leaves and the stem bark are still used in ethnopharmacology to treat digestive disorders and gastric ulcers as antitussive, laxative and hypotensive drugs; even now, it is used in China to treat children who suffer from typhoid fever, furuncle and ecthyma. In Taiwan, the dry seeds for the variety spinosa (Suan Zao Ren) are the second most commonly prescribed and used phytomedicine for insomnia. Its popularity and production have increased worldwide in recent years, especially in Europe. The European Pharmacopoeia Commission has been unable to elaborate upon the EP monograph on Ziziphi spinosae semen as was planned. The EMA has not made its recommendations yet. Is it still a gap in the scientific knowledge? Or is difficult for traditional Chinese medicinal herbs to fulfill the style and quality parameters that are required?

1	Total Phenolics and Total Flavonoids Contents and Hypnotic Effect in Mice of Ziziphus mauritiana Lam. Seed Extract.The seeds of Ziziphus mauritiana Lam. have been traditionally used for treatment of various complications including insomnia and anxiety. They are popularly used as sedative and hypnotic drugs in China, Korea, Myanmar, Vietnam, and other Asian countries. However, no scientific proof on hypnotic activity of Z. mauritiana seeds (ZMS) was reported. In this study, the hypnotic activity of 50% ethanolic extract from ZMS was observed on the loss of righting reflex in mice using pentobarbital-induced sleep mice method. The contents of total phenolics and total flavonoids in the extract were also determined. The results showed that the 50% ethanolic extract from ZMS contained total phenolics 27.62 +- 1.43 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g extract and total flavonoids 0.74 +- 0.03 mg quercetin equivalent (QE)/g extract. Oral administration of the extract at the dose of 200 mg/kg significantly increased the sleeping time in mice intraperitoneally administered with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg body weight). These results supported the traditional use of ZMS for the treatment of insomnia. The seeds of Z. mauritiana should be further developed as an alternative sedative and/or hypnotic product. 	z. mauritiana quercetin
2	Histochemical localization of glycoconjugates on microglial cells in Alzheimer's disease brain samples by using Abrus precatorius, Maackia amurensis, Momordica charantia, and Sambucus nigra lectins.Four lectins (Abrus precatorius (APA), Maackia amurensis (MAA), Momordica charantia (MCA) and Sambucus nigra (SNA)) have been used to identify glycohistochemically the microglial cells (MGC) activation in autoptic brain samples from Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects. Three of these lectins (APA, MAA and MCA) have utilized as microglial cell markers for the first time. The identification of new markers for the study of MGC is very important to better understand the role of these type of cells in the metabolic/dismetabolic control of betaA4 in AD which still represents a vexata questio.

2	Antiproliferative and anticarcinogenic effects of an aqueous preparation of Abies alba and Viscum album se abies, on a L-1210 malignant cell line and tumor-bearing Wistar rats.Extracts of plants have been widely tested for possible anticarcinogenic properties. In the present study a traditional remedy, consisting of an aqueous extract of mixed parts of the tree Abies alba and its mistletoe Viscum album se abies was tested on benzo(alpha)pyrene(BaP)-induced tumors in Wistar rats and on the L-1210 malignant cell line. Two main groups of male Wistar rats subcutaneously injected by 10 mg of BaP, a dose inducing 100% carcinogenesis, a control group (C-G, 15 rats) and a treatment group(TR-G, 18 rats), were used for the study. Five animals bearing BaP-induced tumors were also tested (TR-1-G). Animals of the TR-G were orally administered with the aqueous extract at doses of 50 ml/kg b.w, from the day of BaP injection and of the TR-1-G, from the 120th day of injection, till death. L-1210 malignant cells in cultivation, were administered with a powder obtained by condensation and lyophilization of the extract, at various concentrations and cytotoxicity was measured by the microculture tetrazolium assay. Autopsy of the rats, revealed metastasis in the lungs of the animals of all groups and the tumors developed were histologically identified as leiomyosarcomas. The results indicated that the extract of the above plants possess anticarcinogenic effects, documented by: a) its antiproliferative effects on L-1210 cells (IC50 = 49.6 +/- 1.4 micrograms/ml), b) the significant prolongation of life and reduction of tumor growth rate of the animals of the TR-G in comparison to the C-G, c) the inhibition by 16.6% of tumor induction in the TR-G and d) the prolongation of life and the necrotic effects of the extract on the tumors of the animals in the TR-1-G. The antiproliferative effects of the Abies alba and Viscum album se abies extract may be due to the lectins and thionins contained in Viscum album, as well as to the monoterpenes contained in Abies alba. Soft tissue tumors sensitive to the extract, are widespread among human organs, even in larynx, and are usually resistant to chemotherapy.	viscum album tumors
1	Analgesia Synergism of Essential Oil from Pericarp of Zanthoxylum schinifolium and Verapamil.Objective. To evaluate the synergistic analgesic effect of essential oil of Zanthoxylum schinifolium Sieb. et Zucc. (EOZ) and verapamil (Ver). Method. The qualitative and quantitative composition of EOZ were determined with gas chromatography/Mass spectrometer. The interaction between EOZ and Ver in antinociceptive activity was evaluated by using acetic acid-induced writhing, hot plate, and tail flick tests in mice and in isolated toad sciatic nerve test. Results. Linalool, limonene, and sabinene are the major components of EOZ. EOZ (middle-dose: 40 mg kg(-1), high-dose: 80 mg kg(-1)) and EOZ + Ver (Each dose group) have remarkable analgesic effects on pain in mice induced by acetic acid-induced writhing, hot plate, and tail flick tests. Low-dose EOZ (20 mg kg(-1)) had no analgesic action, but when it is combined with Ver it has shown significant antinociception. Verapamil has a faint analgesic effect but was not able to inhibit action potential transmission in toad sciatic nerve. EOZ (0.2%) and EOZ + Ver (0.2% + 0.05%) also inhibited action potential transmission in toad sciatic nerve. Combination of EOZ with Ver had a greater analgesic effect and inhibition of nerve action potential transmission compared to its components EOZ and Ver. Conclusion. The combination of EOZ with Ver produces a synergistic analgesic effect. 	zanthoxylum schinifolium limonene
1	Anti-inflammatory activity of seed essential oil from Zizyphus jujuba.This study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of essential oil from seeds of Zizyphus jujuba on TPA-induced skin inflammation in experimental mice. Exposure of TPA on the ear of the BALB/c mice caused a marked increase in both ear thickness and skin water content. The ear thickness was measured for TPA-induced ear was 0.54 mm, as compared to control (0.23 mm). Treatment with 1% and 10% of essential oil caused significant decrease in ear thicknesses which were measured to be 0.30 and 0.35 mm, as well as reduce the water content about 51% and 53% in the TPA-induced skin inflammation model, respectively. Furthermore, histological analysis clearly confirmed that Z. jujuba essential oil inhibited the inflammatory responses of skin inflammation in animal model. Therefore, our findings demonstrate that the essential oil of Z. jujuba seeds might accelerate the development of new drugs for various inflammatory diseases.	z. jujuba essential oil
1	Antibacterial benzofuran neolignans and benzophenanthridine alkaloids from the roots of Zanthoxylum capense.Two new 2-arylbenzofuran neolignans and a new benzophenanthridine alkaloid, together with six known benzophenanthridine alkaloids, namely, decarine, norchelerythrine, dihydrochelerythrine, 6-acetonyldihydrochelerythrine, tridecanonchelerythrine, and 6-acetonyldihydronitidine, have been isolated from the MeOH extract of the roots of Zanthoxylum capense. Their structures were elucidated by means of spectroscopic techniques including 2D NMR experiments. All the isolated compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Some compounds showed significant inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 with MIC values ranging from 12.5 to 50 mug/mL.	zanthoxylum capense 2-arylbenzofuran neolignans
1	Aroma constituents and alkylamides of red and green huajiao (Zanthoxylum bungeanum and Zanthoxylum schinifolium).Huajiao denotes the fruits of various species of Zanthoxylum in the plant family Rutaceare used for cooking. The two most commercially popular species are bungeanum (red huajiao) and schinifolium (green huajiao). Fresh huajiao has a very high content of essential oil, up to 11%, which is described as having fresh, spicy, floral, cooling, and green aroma notes. A comprehensive analysis of the essential oils by GC-MS using advanced peak deconvolution and data processing software, revealed many overlapping components. A total of 120 aroma compounds for each species has been found. In the essential oils, linalyl acetate (15%), linalool (13%), and limonene (12%) are the major components of red huajiao, whereas linalool (29%), limonene (14%), and sabinene (13%) are the major components of green huajiao. For estimation of the aroma contribution of individual components, a new concept, "aroma character impact value" (ACI), is introduced as the percentage of the ratio of the concentration of an aroma component to its odor threshold value. Despite the differences in major components, both species have six common compounds of top aroma character impact: linalool, alpha-terpineol, myrcene, 1,8-cineole, limonene, and geraniol. The tingling sensation of huajiao is caused mainly by the alkylamide hydroxy-alpha-sanshool. The tingling compound decomposes easily under hydrolytic conditions or under UV light.

1	The jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) fruit: a review of current knowledge of fruit composition and health benefits.The nutritional jujube ( Ziziphus jujube Mill.) fruit belonging to the Rhamnaceous family grows mostly in Europe, southern and eastern Asia, and Australia, especially the inland region of northern China. Jujube has a long history of usage as a fruit and remedy. The main biologically active components are vitamin C, phenolics, flavonoids, triterpenic acids, and polysaccharides. Recent phytochemical studies of jujube fruits have shed some light on their biological effects, such as the anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antiobesity, immunostimulating, antioxidant, hepatoprotective, and gastrointestinal protective activities and inhibition of foam cell formation in macrophages. A stronger focus on clinical studies and phytochemical definition of jujube fruits will be essential for future research efforts. This review may be useful for predicting other medicinal uses and potential drug or food interactions and may be beneficial for people living where the jujube fruits are prevalent and health care resources are scarce.	jujube triterpenic acids
2	The effect of medicinal plants of Islamabad and Murree region of Pakistan on insulin secretion from INS-1 cells.In vitro testing of the extracts of medicinal plants collected from Islamabad and the Murree region on insulin secretagogue activity was carried out. Dried ethanol extracts of all plants (ZH1-ZH19) were dissolved in ethanol and DMSO, and tested at various concentrations (between 1 and 40 microg/mL) for insulin release from INS-1 cells in the presence of 5.5 mM glucose. Glibenclamide was used as a control. Promising insulin secretagogue activity in various plant extracts at 1, 10, 20 and 40 microg/mL was found, while in some cases a decrease in insulin secretion was also observed. Artemisia roxburghiana, Salvia coccinia and Monstera deliciosa showed insulin secretagogue activity at 1 microg/mL (p &lt; 0.05) while Abies pindrow, Centaurea iberica and Euphorbia helioscopia were active at 10 microg/mL (p &lt; 0.05). Extracts of Bauhinia variegata and Bergenia himalacia showed effects at 20 microg/mL (p &lt; 0.05), and Taraxacum officinale and Viburnum foetens at 40 microg/mL (p &lt; 0.05). Insulin secretagogue activity could not be detected in the extracts of Adhatoda vasica, Cassia fistula, Chrysanthemum leucanthemum, Morus alba, Plectranthus rugosus, Peganum harmala and Olea ferruginea. The results suggest that medicinal plants of Islamabad and the Murree region of Pakistan may be potential natural resources for antidiabetic compounds.	monstera deliciosa insulin secretion
1	Mapping Immunodominant Antibody Epitopes of Abrin.Abrin, a toxin isolated from the seeds of Abrus precatorius (jequirity pea) is considered a biological threat agent by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. To date, there is no effective postexposure treatment for abrin poisoning, and efforts are being made to develop an efficient vaccine and measures for postexposure therapy. Epitope mapping is widely applied as an efficient tool for discovering the antigenic moieties of toxins, thus providing invaluable information needed for the development of vaccines and therapies. Aiming to identify the immunodominant epitopes of abrin, several neutralizing antiabrin polyclonal antibodies were screened using a set of 15-mer peptides spanning the amino acid sequence of either the A or B subunits of abrin. Analysis of the antibody-binding pattern revealed 11 linear epitopes for the A subunit and 14 epitopes for the B subunit that are located on the surface of the toxin and thus accessible for antibody interactions. Moreover, the spatial location of several of these epitopes suggests they may block the galactose-binding pockets or the catalytic domain, thus neutralizing the toxin. These findings provide useful information and suggest a possible strategy for the development and design of an improved abrin-based vaccine and therapeutic antibodies.	abrus precatorius galactose
2	Flos Abelmoschus manihot extract attenuates DSS-induced colitis by regulating gut microbiota and Th17/Treg balance.Flos Abelmoschus manihot is widely used as traditional drug in China. Abelmoschus manihot (AM) extracted from Flos Abelmoschus manihot that has been applied for treating chronic inflammatory diseases. Here we showed that AM significantly alleviated DSS-induced colitis in mice. AM modified gut microbiota composition, increased microbial diversity, and in particularly, elevated the abundance of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing gut microbiota in colitic mice. Consequently, levels of SCFAs especially butyrate and acetate were increased upon AM treatment, which, primarily through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) pathway, led to the enhanced Treg generation and the suppressed Th17 development. Together, we herein provide the first evidences to support that AM, a natural plant-derived complex, can potentially reset gut microbiome and metabolism, resume immune and tissue homeostasis, and hence prevent colitis, which may provide a new perspective on IBD pathogenesis and suggest a novel microbiota-targeting therapy for inflammatory gut diseases.	abelmoschus manihot colitis
2	Investigation of in vivo metabolic profile of Abelmoschus Manihot based on pattern recognition analysis.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Abelmoschus manihot (L.) Medik. var. manihot is one of the most commonly used Chinese medicines and has played an important role in treating chronic glomerulonephritis and diabetic nephropathy. AIM OF THE STUDY: Metabolites identification of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a complex and time-consuming process due to the complicity of TCM and subsequent large number of detected ions. In this paper, UPLC-MS combined with pattern recognition analysis approach were used to simplify and quicken the identification of the metabolites of Abelmoschus Manihot. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rat urine samples were collected before (as control sample) and after Abelmoschus Manihot administration. Pattern recognition analysis method was used to differentiate components between Abelmoschus Manihot-treated group and its controlled comparison. These components could be considered as Abelmoschus Manihot-related metabolites in vivo. RESULTS: LC-MS based metabolomics could be an advanced tool to help us find metabolites with regards to its capacity of processing large datasets, differentiating and classifying of sample groups, as well as its indiscriminative nature of biomarker and metabolite identification. Using this method, seven metabolites were identified, which are flavonoid aglycone glucuronidation, sulfatation, and methylation metabolites. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that UPLC-MS based- pattern recognition analysis approach can be used to quickly identify Abelmoschus Manihot related metabolites in biological fluids. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the potential application of combining the UPLC-MS approach with the metabolomics approach in identifying the metabolites of TCM.	abelmoschus manihot diabetic nephropathy
4	In Vitro Evaluations of Cytotoxicity of Eight Antidiabetic Medicinal Plants and Their Effect on GLUT4 Translocation.Despite the enormous achievements in conventional medicine, herbal-based medicines are still a common practice for the treatment of diabetes. Trigonella foenum-graecum, Atriplex halimus, Olea europaea, Urtica dioica, Allium sativum, Allium cepa, Nigella sativa, and Cinnamomum cassia are strongly recommended in the Greco-Arab and Islamic medicine for the treatment and prevention of diabetes. Cytotoxicity (MTT and LDH assays) of the plant extracts was assessed using cells from the liver hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2) and cells from the rat L6 muscle cell line. The effects of the plant extracts (50% ethanol in water) on glucose transporter-4 (GLUT4) translocation to the plasma membrane was tested in an ELISA test on L6-GLUT4myc cells. Results obtained indicate that Cinnamomon cassia is cytotoxic at concentrations higher than 100  mu g/mL, whereas all other tested extracts exhibited cytotoxic effects at concentrations higher than 500  mu g/mL. Exposing L6-GLUT4myc muscle cell to extracts from Trigonella foenum-graecum, Urtica dioica, Atriplex halimus, and Cinnamomum verum led to a significant gain in GLUT4 on their plasma membranes at noncytotoxic concentrations as measured with MTT assay and the LDH leakage assay. These findings indicate that the observed anti-diabetic properties of these plants are mediated, at least partially, through regulating GLUT4 translocation.	GLUT4 diabetic
2	Abrus precatorius Poisoning: A Retrospective Study of 112 Patients.Abrus precatorius is a rare but important cause of plant poisoning, especially in tropical countries like India. Most of the published literature on Abrus is limited a few case reports. Hence, we did a retrospective study the clinical features and outcome of Abrus poisoning. Case records of patients admitted to medicine wards during 7 years were included in the study. A total of 112 patients were studied. The majority were females (78%), and most of the patients were between 13 and 30 years (81%). Diarrhea was the most common symptom (66%), and blood in stools was present in (33%). Six patients had died with a mortality rate of (5.35%).	abrus precatorius abrus poisoning
2	Efficacy and safety of HT080 for lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia: A study protocol for a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (LUTS/BPH) are one of the most common conditions seen in middle-aged and elderly men and threaten their quality of life. Since conventional pharmacotherapy for LUTS/BPH can lead to sexual side effects, herbal therapies are widely used as complementary and alternative treatments worldwide. HT080 is an herbal extract of Cinnamomum cassia and Rosa Laevigata, both of which have been used to treat symptoms typically associated with BPH in traditional Asian medicine. The aims of this trial are to assess whether HT080 can alleviate LUTS/BPH in middle-aged and elderly men, and to investigate the safety of HT080. METHODS/DESIGN: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, two-arm parallel group trial will be conducted in men with moderate LUTS/BPH. A total of 100 eligible men aged 40 to 75 years with an International Prostate Symptom Score of 8 to 19 will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio and receive either HT080 (500 mg) or placebo twice a day for 12 weeks. All participants will be evaluated for efficacy and safety at baseline and weeks 6 and 12. The primary endpoint is the change in International Prostate Symptom Score between baseline and week 12. The secondary efficacy variables are uroflowmetry parameters (maximal urinary flow rate and post-void residual volume), serum prostate-specific antigen, testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone levels, the International Index of Erectile Function score, and participant-reported global response assessment scores. The safety assessments include adverse events, laboratory tests results, vital signs, and physical examination. DISCUSSION: This is a first-in human trial designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of HT080 among middle-aged and elderly men with LUTS/BPH. This prospective study with a double-blind randomized design will provide high-quality evidence supporting the use of HT080 for LUTS/BPH.

2	Activity-directed-fractionation and isolation of four antibacterial compounds from Abrus precatorius L., roots.Root extracts of the plant Abrus precatorius L., was tested for antibacterial activity. Various solvent fractions exhibited inhibitory activity against 13 gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Root extracts were analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC). The antibacterial activity was localized to specific chromatophores in the chloroform fraction through a bioautography assay. It was found localized to four chromatophores out of seven. The chromatophores were isolated from the TLC plates and rechecked for activity against Slaphylococcus aureus A, using a disc diffusion assay. Among the four active principles isolated, AP 3 (Rf 0.87) exhibited maximum activity i.e. 56% inhibition of growth of S. aureus A, in disc diffusion assay compared to the standard antibiotic Ampicillin. Results of this study suggest that chloroform extractable phytochemicals in A. precatorius L. may yield promising molecules with antibiotic activity.	a. precatorius antibacterial activity
1	Efficient quantification of the phenolic profiles of Zanthoxylum bungeanum leaves and correlation between chromatographic fingerprint and antioxidant activity.Sixteen subsequent fractions were prepared from the ethyl acetate fraction of Zanthoxylum bungeanum leaves after bio-guided chromatographic separation. The HPLC profiles and antioxidant activity of the various fractions indicated that the content of eight phenolic compounds (chlorogenic acid, epicatechin, rutin, hyperoside, trifolin, quercitrin, afzelin and quercetin) and antioxidant activity vary significantly, and high concentrations of a combination of eight phenolic compounds would result in an increase of the antioxidant activity. These results suggested that the eight compounds could be used as chemical markers for quality assessment of Z. bungeanum leaves. Correlation between chromatographic fingerprint and antioxidant activity of the fractions showed that quercitrin and hyperoside play crucial roles in the antioxidant activity, and they can be seen as the milestone for quality control. The findings also suggested that five obtained fractions (E-3-3, E-2-4, E-7, E-5 and E-4) could become useful supplements for functional food ingredients and health-related products. 	z. bungeanum rutin
1	Validation of a high-performance liquid chromatography method for the determination of (-)-alpha-bisabolol from particulate systems.A reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography method has been developed and validated for determination and quantitation of the natural sesquiterpene (-)-alpha-bisabolol. Furthermore the application of the method was done by characterization of chitosan milispheres and liposomes entrapping Zanthoxylum tingoassuiba essential oil, which contains appreciable amount of (-)-alpha-bisabolol. A reversed-phase C(18) column and gradient elution was used with the mobile phase composed of (A) acetonitrile-water-phosphoric acid (19:80:1) and (B) acetonitrile. The eluent was pumped at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min with UV detection at 200 nm. In the range 0.02-0.64 mg/mL the assay showed good linearity (R(2 )= 0.9999) and specificity for successful identification and quantitation of (-)-alpha-bisabolol in the essential oil without interfering peaks. The method also showed good reproducibility, demonstrating inter-day and intra-day precision based on relative standard deviation values (up to 3.03%), accuracy (mean recovery of 100.69% +/- 1.05%) and low values of detection and quantitation limits (0.0005 and 0.0016 mg/mL, respectively). The method was also robust for showing a recovery of 98.81% under a change of solvent in standard solutions. The suitability of the method was demonstrated by the successful determination of association efficiency of the (-)-alpha-bisabolol in chitosan milispheres and liposomes.	zanthoxylum tingoassuiba essential oil
1	Larvicidal activity and structure activity relationship of cinnamoyl amides from Zanthoxylum armatum and their synthetic analogues against diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella.Cinnamoyl amides isolated from Zanthoxylum armatum (Rutaceae) and their synthetic analogues were tested for their insecticidal activity against the second instar larvae of diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Yponomeutidae) to determine the promising structures with insecticidal activity. Most of the test compounds showed promising activity against larvae of P. xylostella. However, the activities of different compounds varied depending on the presence of different substituents at various positions of both the aromatic rings A and B. Among the tested compounds, 8, N-(3-bromo-4-methoxyphenethyl)cinnamamide showed best larvicidal activity with an LC50 = 62.13 mg/L followed by 6, N-(3 -bromophenethyl)cinnamamide (LC50=128.49 mg/L) and 2 N-(4 -methoxyphenylethyl)cinnamamide (LC50 = 225.65 mg/L). 	zanthoxylum armatum cinnamoyl amides
3	Miscellaneous terpenoid constituents of Abies nephrolepis and their moderate cytotoxic activities.Three monoterpenoids and two triterpenoids were isolated from Abies nephrolepis together with 53 known terpenoids. The structures of the compounds were established by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. The absolute configuration of 3-hydroxycamphane-2-carboxylic acid was established as (1S,2R,3S,4R) by Cu-Kalpha X-ray crystallography. All 58 isolates were tested for cytotoxic activity against four tumor cells viz. A549 (human lung adenocarcinoma), Colo205 (colon adenocarcinoma), QGY-7703 (human hepatoma) and THP-1 (human monocytic leukemia). alpha-Cadinol exhibited the best effects on A549, Colo205 and QGY-7703 with IC(50) values of 8.6, 8.1 and 4.6 mug/mL, respectively.	alpha-Cadinol hepatoma
2	Exploration of nutraceutical potential of herbal oil formulated from parasitic plant.BACKGROUND: Cuscuta reflexa (C. reflexa) is a parasitic climber of medicinal importance. The present study was aimed to evaluate the nutraceutical potential of C. reflexa stems collected from different hosts and to evaluate the role of the herbal formulation in dandruff, hair fall control as well as hair growth promoter. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hair formulations of C. reflexa collected from different host plants were prepared in the form of herbal oils (10% w/v). C. reflexa stems were extracted using mustard oil as base oil by using direct boiling technique. Prepared oil was studied as hair tonic. The experimental protocols used were anti-dandruff hair growth activity, as well as hair fall reduction. Herbal hair oils versus mustard oil were evaluated by applying oils on human volunteers with hair fall and dandruff problem whereas promotion of hair growth activity was conducted on rats. The formulated oils were also characterised for proximate analysis, physiochemical composition, as well as antimicrobial activity. RESULT: The test oils of C. reflexa collected from Azadiracta indica and Zizyphus jujuba were effective in the promotion of hair growth, dandruff control, as well as reduction in hair fall activity. CONCLUSION: All the formulated oils showed potent antimicrobial activity against all selected strains of bacteria and fungi.	c. reflexa reduction in hair fall
2	From type 2 diabetes to antioxidant activity: a systematic review of the safety and efficacy of common and cassia cinnamon bark.Common (Cinnamomum verum, C. zeylanicum) and cassia (C. aromaticum) cinnamon have a long history of use as spices and flavouring agents. A number of pharmacological and clinical effects have been observed with their use. The objective of this study was to systematically review the scientific literature for preclinical and clinical evidence of safety, efficacy, and pharmacological activity of common and cassia cinnamon. Using the principles of evidence-based practice, we searched 9 electronic databases and compiled data according to the grade of evidence found. One pharmacological study on antioxidant activity and 7 clinical studies on various medical conditions were reported in the scientific literature including type 2 diabetes (3), Helicobacter pylori infection (1), activation of olfactory cortex of the brain (1), oral candidiasis in HIV (1), and chronic salmonellosis (1). Two of 3 randomized clinical trials on type 2 diabetes provided strong scientific evidence that cassia cinnamon demonstrates a therapeutic effect in reducing fasting blood glucose by 10.3%-29%; the third clinical trial did not observe this effect. Cassia cinnamon, however, did not have an effect at lowering glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c). One randomized clinical trial reported that cassia cinnamon lowered total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides; the other 2 trials, however, did not observe this effect. There was good scientific evidence that a species of cinnamon was not effective at eradicating H. pylori infection. Common cinnamon showed weak to very weak evidence of efficacy in treating oral candidiasis in HIV patients and chronic salmonellosis.	cinnamon diabetes
1	Phytochemical and biological activities of four wild medicinal plants.The fruits of four wild plants, namely, Capparis decidua, Ficus carica, Syzygium cumini, and Ziziphus jujuba, are separately used as traditional dietary and remedial agents in remote areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. The results of our study on these four plants revealed that the examined fruits were a valuable source of nutraceuticals and exhibited good level of antimicrobial activity. The fruits of these four investigated plants are promising source of polyphenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, and saponins. These four plants' fruits are good sources of iron, zinc, copper, manganese, selenium, and chromium. It was also observed that these fruits are potential source of antioxidant agent and the possible reason could be that these samples had good amount of phytochemicals. Hence, the proper propagation, conservation, and chemical investigation are recommended so that these fruits should be incorporated for the eradication of food and health related problems. 	syzygium cumini polyphenols
1	Combined analysis by GC (RI), GC-MS and 13C NMR of the supercritical fluid extract of Abies alba twigs.Two samples (leaves and twigs) of Abies alba Miller from Corsica were extracted using supercritical CO2 and their chemical compositions were compared with those of the essential oils obtained from the same batch of plant material. In total 45 components were identified using combined analysis by GC (RI), GC-MS and 13C NMR. It was observed that the contents of monoterpenes (mainly represented by limonene, alpha-pinene and camphene) were significantly lower in the supercritical fluid extract (SFE) than in the essential oil (EO). Conversely, the proportions of sesquiterpenes were much higher in CO2 extracts than in essential oils (around 30% vs 4%). Cis-abienol, a diterpene alcohol, was identified only in SFE, and the proportions of this constituent (7.5% and 17.3%) were determined using quantitative 13C NMR since it was under estimated using the standard conditions of GC.	abies alba monoterpenes
2	Invasion inhibitors of human fibrosarcoma HT 1080 cells from the rhizomes of Zingiber cassumunar: structures of phenylbutanoids, cassumunols.The methanolic extract and its EtOAc-soluble fraction from the rhizomes of Zingiber cassumunar inhibited invasion of human fibrosarcoma HT 1080 cells. From the EtOAc-soluble fraction, eight new phenylbutanoids, cassumunols A-H, were isolated together with 30 known constituents. The structures of new phenylbutanoids were elucidated on the basis of chemical and physicochemical evidence. Principal constituents were examined the inhibitory effects on the invasion of HT 1080 cells. Among them, phlain I and III, (E)-1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)buta-1,3-diene, (E)-1-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)buta-1,3-diene, and (-)-beta-sesquiphellandrene showed anti-invasion effects. Interestingly, (E)-1-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)buta-1,3-diene [inhibition (%) 46.8 +- 7.2 (p&lt;0.05) at 30 microM] significantly inhibited the invasion, and only a weak cytotoxic effect was observed.	zingiber cassumunar fibrosarcoma ht
3	Quantification of flavoring constituents in cinnamon: high variation of coumarin in cassia bark from the German retail market and in authentic samples from indonesia.Coumarin is a flavoring which can cause hepatotoxicity in experimental animals and in a proportion of the human population. The tolerable daily intake (TDI) may be exceeded in consumers with high intake of cinnamon containing high levels of coumarin. The objective of this study was to determine these levels in cinnamon samples and to identify possible factors influencing them. A HPLC method to quantify coumarin and related constituents (cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, eugenol) in a single run was used. Results found in 47 cinnamon powder samples obtained from the German retail market confirmed high levels of coumarin in cassia cinnamon. A huge variation was observed in stick samples from two packages (range from below the limit of detection to about 10000 mg/kg). Cassia bark samples of five trees received directly from Indonesia were analyzed additionally. Interestingly, a high variation was observed in one of the trees, whereas no coumarin was detected in the samples of two other trees. In conclusion, coumarin levels in cassia cinnamon can vary widely even within a single tree.	coumarin hepatotoxicity
1	Imaging cell wall architecture in single Zinnia elegans tracheary elements.The chemical and structural organization of the plant cell wall was examined in Zinnia elegans tracheary elements (TEs), which specialize by developing prominent secondary wall thickenings underlying the primary wall during xylogenesis in vitro. Three imaging platforms were used in conjunction with chemical extraction of wall components to investigate the composition and structure of single Zinnia TEs. Using fluorescence microscopy with a green fluorescent protein-tagged Clostridium thermocellum family 3 carbohydrate-binding module specific for crystalline cellulose, we found that cellulose accessibility and binding in TEs increased significantly following an acidified chlorite treatment. Examination of chemical composition by synchrotron radiation-based Fourier-transform infrared spectromicroscopy indicated a loss of lignin and a modest loss of other polysaccharides in treated TEs. Atomic force microscopy was used to extensively characterize the topography of cell wall surfaces in TEs, revealing an outer granular matrix covering the underlying meshwork of cellulose fibrils. The internal organization of TEs was determined using secondary wall fragments generated by sonication. Atomic force microscopy revealed that the resulting rings, spirals, and reticulate structures were composed of fibrils arranged in parallel. Based on these combined results, we generated an architectural model of Zinnia TEs composed of three layers: an outermost granular layer, a middle primary wall composed of a meshwork of cellulose fibrils, and inner secondary wall thickenings containing parallel cellulose fibrils. In addition to insights in plant biology, studies using Zinnia TEs could prove especially productive in assessing cell wall responses to enzymatic and microbial degradation, thus aiding current efforts in lignocellulosic biofuel production.	zinnia elegans carbohydrate
2	Attempted suicide, by mail order: Abrus precatorius.OBJECTIVE: Abrus precatorius is cultivated in many subtropical areas. The seeds exist in a variety of colors such as black, orange, and most commonly, glossy red. A black band is found at the end of the seed. The plant contains multiple pods which typically contain three to five Abrus seeds. The seeds contain abrin, which inhibits ribosomal function, halting protein synthesis and leading to cellular death. A unique aspect of this case is the use of the internet to order a potentially lethal poison as well as transmission of a picture to identify the seed. CASE REPORT: A 20-year-old man presented to the emergency department complaining of vomiting and watery diarrhea for 6-8 h prior to arrival. He denied any medication use, recent illness, travel, or changes in his diet. Initial vital signs were normal. The patient was diagnosed with viral gastroenteritis. During his evaluation, the patient admitted to feeling suicidal. While awaiting psychiatry evaluation, the patient's father arrived with a box of small hard red seeds, which he believed that his son ingested in a suicide attempt. The seeds could not be identified by the staff. A picture of the seeds was transmitted by e-mail to the New York City Poison Control Center, allowing their identification as A. precatorius. The patient was reinterviewed and admitted to chewing and swallowing 10 seeds. Given the potential toxicity of abrin, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. He continued to have frequent episodes of emesis as well as diarrhea. He gradually improved over 2 days. He admitted to ordering a box of Abrus seeds online from Asia after reading on the Internet about their use in suicide. He was eventually discharged for outpatient follow-up with no permanent sequelae. CONCLUSION: Abrin has an estimated human fatal dose of 0.1-1 mug/kg. Most cases of Abrus seed ingestions are unintentional and occur in children. Ingesting the intact seeds typically results in no clinical findings, as they pass through the gastrointestinal tract due to their hard shell. Abrin released during chewing is poorly absorbed systemically from the gastrointestinal tract. This causes the vomiting and diarrhea with resultant hypovolemia and electrolyte disturbances, which can be severe and life threatening, particularly in areas with less advanced health care systems. Management is primarily supportive.	a. precatorius diarrhea
2	Syzygium aromaticum L.: Traditional herbal medicine against cagA and vacA toxin genes-producing drug resistant Helicobacter pylori.The Pan-Drug Resistant (PDR), Helicobacter pylori remains an intractable challenge in public health worldwide and this pathogenicity is mainly due to the presence of a cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) and vacuolating cytotoxin A (VacA). On the other hand, plant extracts such as Syzygium aromaticum contain a diverse array of secondary metabolites, which could be potentially used to combat H. pylori pathogens. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the biomedical potential of S. aromaticum extract against cytotoxin-associated genes producing PDR H. pylori. In this investigation, out of 45 gastric antral biopsy specimens of dyspeptic patients, 20 strains were confirmed as H. pylori. Eight (40%) out of 20 strains were PDR H. pylori while the rest of the strains were Multi-Drug Resistant (MDR) strains. Genotypic analyses of PDR H. pylori strains showed that cagA and vacA genes were found to be 75% and 87.5%, respectively and m2s2 was the most common subtype of vacA gene. S. aromaticum showed a significant higher anti-H. pylori activity compared to that of Cinnamomum zeylanicum and Thymus vulgaris. Eugenol was the major phenolic compound (28.14%) detected in the methanolic extract of S. aromaticum. Clearly, results of the toxicological assessment confirmed the safety of S. aromaticum for use. Hence, these results suggest that S. aromaticum could be a new useful natural antimicrobial agent that could potentially combat cytotoxin genes-producing drug-resistant H. pylori. Moreover, these findings provide a scientific basis for the development of antimicrobial agents from traditional herbal medicines for gastroprotection against gastric ulcer.	s. aromaticum gastric ulcer
3	Renal protective effect and action mechanism of Huangkui capsule and its main five flavonoids.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The flower of Abelmoschus manihot (Linn.) Medicus (A. manihot), as a traditional Chinese Herbal medicine, was used widely in China with efficacy of inducing diuresis for treating strangurtia, and subdhing swelling and detoxicating. It has been reported that Huangkui capsule, prepared by the extract of the flower of A. manihot, can reduce the content of urinary protein, serum creatinine and serum urea nitrogen in nephropathy rats and processes renoprotective activity, while the action mechanism need to illuminate deeply. AIMS OF THE STUDY: In this study, we investigated the protection effect of Huangkui capsule on tubulointerstitial fibrosis in chronic renal failure (CRF) rats and its mechanism against high glucose-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in renal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2) of its bioactive components. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The animals were divided into normal group, CRF model group and Huangkui capsule-treated group. Hematoxylin eosin (HE) staining and Masson staining were applied to observe pathological changes in renal tissue of different groups. Biochemical indicators including serum urea nitrogen (BUN), urine protein (UP) and serum creatinine (Scr) were measured according to the manufacturer's instructions of kits. HK-2 cell damaged model was established to access the protection effect and action mechanism of five main flavonoids from Huangkui capsule. The experimental cells were divided into eight groups: control group, model group, positive drug group and five main flavonoids treated groups. The dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) assay was used to determine the reactive oxygen species (ROS) in different groups. Western blot was applied to analyze the expression of pathogenesis-related proteins in different groups. RESULTS: The results stated that Huangkui capsule significantly inhibited the elevation of Scr, BUN, UP, the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), phosphorylation-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK1/2), NADPH Oxidase 1, NADPH Oxidase 2 and NADPH Oxidase 4 in adenine-induced CRF rats. The main bioactive components of quercetin (QT), hyperoside (HY), isoquercitrin (IQT), gossypetin-8-O-beta-D-glucuronide (GG) and quercetin-3'-O-glucoside (QG) at the dosage of 100microM, like NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium, exhibited a significant effect on inhibiting the expression of alpha-SMA, p-ERK1/2, NADPH Oxidase 1, NADPH Oxidase 2 and NADPH Oxidase 4 in high glucose-induced HK-2 cells, especially GG. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated that Huangkui capsule and the flavonoids components prevent tubulointerstitial fibrosis in CRF rat involvement in the action mechanism of inhibiting NADPH oxidase/ROS/ERK pathway.	flavonoids nephropathy
1	Effects of HuangKui capsules on glibenclamide pharmacokinetics in rats.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY: The main components of HuangKui capsules' are the total flavonoids extracted from the flowers of Abelmoschus manihot L medic. They have been widely used to treat chronic glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy and nephrotic syndrome. The combination of HuangKui capsules and glibenclamide is a possible therapy for patients with diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy. However, there is no report about effects of HuangKui capsules on the glibenclamide pharmacokinetics till now. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study was aimed investigating the effect of HuangKui capsules on pharmacokinetics of glibenclamide in rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eight rats were administered with an oral dose of HuangKui capsules (0.75gkg(-1)) once daily for 10 consecutive days. All the rats were administered orally with the glibenclamide (1mgkg(-1)) before the first time and after the last time given HuangKui capsules. LC-MS/MS was utilized to determine the concentration of glibenclamide in rat plasma and to calculate the corresponding pharmacokinetic parameters. The statistical differences of the two cycles were evaluated by paired-samples t-test. RESULTS: In the rats treated with HuangKui capsules and glibenclamide, the t(1/2), the time point of maximum plasma concentration (T(max)) of glibenclamide increased obviously (p&lt;0.05) compared with the glibenclamide alone, while maximum plasma concentrations (C(max)), area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC((0-t))) decreased significantly (p&lt;0.05). There was no significant difference between other parameters. CONCLUSION: HuangKui capsules can reduce the absorption of glibenclamide and accelerate the metabolism of glibenclamide.	abelmoschus manihot flavonoids

1	Components and insecticidal activity against the maize weevils of Zanthoxylum schinifolium fruits and leaves.In our screening program for new agrochemicals from Chinese medicinal herbs and wild plants, Zanthoxylum schinifolium essential oils were found to possess strong insecticidal activity against the maize weevil Sitophilus zeamais. The essential oils of Z. schinifolium fruits and leaves were extracted via hydrodistillation and investigated by GC and GC-MS. Estragole (69.52%) was the major compound of the essential oil of fresh fruits, followed by linalool (8.63%) and limonene (4.34%) and 94.33% of the total components were monoterpenoids. The main components of the essential oil of fresh leaves were linalool (12.94%), ar-tumerone (8.95%), limonene (6.45%) and elixene (5.43%) and only 50.62% were monoterpenoids. However, the essential oil from purchased fruits contained linalool (33.42%), limonene (13.66%) and sabinene (5.72%), followed by estragole (4.67%), nerol (4.56%) and 4-terpineol (4.27%). Estragole, linalool and sabinene were separated and purified by silica gel column chromatography and preparative thin layer chromatography, and further identified by means of physicochemical and spectrometric analysis. The essential oil from the fresh fruits (LD50 = 15.93 mug/adult) possessed two times more toxicity to the insects compared with that of fresh leaves (LD50 = 35.31 mug/adult). Estragole, linalool and sabinene exhibited contact activity against S. zeamais with LD50 values of 17.63, 13.90 and 23.98 mug/adult, respectively. The essential oils of Z. schinifolium possessed strong fumigant toxicity against S. zeamais adults with LC50 values of 13.19 mg/L (fresh fruits), 24.04 mg/L (fresh leaves) and 17.63 mg/L (purchased fruits). Estragole, linalool and sabinene also exhibited strong fumigant toxicity against the maize weevils with LC50 values of 14.10, 10.46 and 9.12 mg/L, respectively.	maize weevils linalool
2	Effect of four medicinal plants on amyloid-beta induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells.Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) is implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder. This study was designed to determine the effect of four medicinal plants used to treat neurodegenerative diseases on Abeta-induced cell death. Cytotoxicity of the ethanol extracts of the plants was determined against SH-SY5Y (human neuroblastoma) cells which were untreated, as well as toxically induced with Abeta, using the MTT and neutral red uptake assays. Cell viability was reduced to 16% when exposed to 20 microM Abeta25-35 for 72 h. The methanol extract of the roots of Ziziphus mucronata Willd., Lannea schweinfurthii (Engl.) Engl. and Terminalia sericea Burch. ex DC., were the least toxic to the SH-SY5Ycells at the highest concentration tested (100 microg/ml). All four plants tested were observed to reduce the effects of Abeta-induced neuronal cell death, indicating that they may contain compounds which may be relevant in the prevention of AD progression. 	ziziphus mucronata willd AD

From the EtOAc-soluble fraction, eight new phenylbutanoids, cassumunols A-H, were isolated together with 30 known constituents. The structures of new phenylbutanoids were elucidated on the basis of chemical and physicochemical evidence. Principal constituents were examined the inhibitory effects on the invasion of HT 1080 cells. Among them, phlain I and III, (E)-1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)buta-1,3-diene, (E)-1-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)buta-1,3-diene, and (-)-beta-sesquiphellandrene showed anti-invasion effects. Interestingly, (E)-1-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)buta-1,3-diene [inhibition (%) 46.8 +- 7.2 (p&lt;0.05) at 30 microM] significantly inhibited the invasion, and only a weak cytotoxic effect was observed.	zingiber cassumunar (E)-1-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)buta-1,3-diene
2	Abrus precatorius agglutinin-derived peptides induce ROS-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis through JNK and Akt/P38/P53 pathways in HeLa cells.10kDAGP, a tryptic digest of Abrus precatorius lectin 'Agglutinin' is known to induce apoptosis by mitochondria-dependent pathways in human cervical cancer (HeLa) cells. The present study was focused on deciphering the detailed molecular mechanism of apoptosis induction in vitro by 10kDAGP and also its in vivo therapeutic efficacy. For in vivo model, HeLa cell encapsulated hollow fiber was implanted in Swiss Albino mice and treated with 10kDAGP. Our results showed that 10kDAGP was able to enter the cell within a span of 20min and co-localized with mitochondria after 90min. of incubation. A drastic loss of mitochondrial membrane potential was noted within 6h of 10kDAGP administration along with an increase in ROS generation. ROS further led to symptoms of early apoptosis by deregulating Akt (Protein Kinase B) and activating c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK), p38 Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK), p53, and autophagy starting from ~8h of incubation. Besides in vitro conditions, 10kDAGP activated JNK to mediate cancer cell killing in vivo. Therefore, 10kDAGP can be an excellent therapeutic agent as it can act through different ways in the cellular system. Future studies are directed to screen out active peptides from the pool of peptides and to study whether the mode of action is in synergistic way or in individual forms. 	abrus precatorius cancer
1	Kaikasaponin III and soyasaponin I, major triterpene saponins of Abrus cantoniensis, act on GOT and GPT: influence on transaminase elevation of rat liver cells concomitantly exposed to CCl4 for one hour.The antihepatotoxic activities of soyasaponin I and kaikasaponin III, triterpenoidal saponins isolated from Abri Herba, the whole plant of Abrus cantoniensis, were studied on liver injury induced by CCl4 in primary cultured rat hepatocytes. The antihepatotoxic activities of these saponins and glycyrrhizin (positive control) were demonstrated by measuring the levels of glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT) and glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT). Soyasaponin I inhibited the elevation of GOT and GPT activities. The activities were comparable to those of glycyrrhizin. On the other hand, kaikasaponin III was more effective than soyasaponin I and glycyrrhizin. Kaikasaponin III showed the antihepatotoxic activity at less than 100 micrograms/ml. Furthermore, the highest activity was observed even in the lower doses (50, 100 micrograms/ml). However, soyasaponin I and kaikasaponin III showed some toxicity at the highest dose (500 micrograms/ml), though glycyrrhizin did not show toxicity at any dose.	abrus cantoniensis triterpene
2	A comparative antibacterial evaluation of raw and processed Gunja (Abrus precatorius Linn.) seeds.BACKGROUND: Seed of Gunja (Abrus precatorius Linn.), a known poisonous drug, is used extensively in various ayurvedic formulations with great therapeutic significance. Ayurveda recommends the administration of Gunja in diseases like Indralupta (alopecia), Sotha (edema), Krmi (helminthes), Kustha (skin diseases), Kandu (itching), Prameha (urinary disorders) etc., after being treated with specific Sodhana (purification) procedures. OBJECTIVE: To assess the antimicrobial action of of raw and Shodhita (Processed) Gunja seeds. METHODS: Gunja seeds after being processed with Godugdha (cow's milk), Nimbu swarasa (Lemon juice), Kanji (Sour gruel) and water, as the media, were evaluated for its antibacterial effect against clinically important bacterial strains using agar well diffusion method. RESULTS: Aqueous extracts of raw seeds of Gunja exert its antibacterial effect on both Gram positive, as well as Gram negative bacteria but none of the Sodhita Gunja seeds showed any bactericidal effect on any bacterial strains. Chloroform extracts of all the Sodhita Gunja seed extracts could inhibit bacterial growth but with variations. CONCLUSION: The study displayed that chloroform extracts of raw and sodhita samples for bacterial study were much sensitive than the aqueous extracts.	abrus precatorius itching
1	In vitro activities of plant extracts on human Loa loa isolates and cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells.Loa loa, a filarial worm, can cause fatal encephalitis in humans. In an attempt to find alternatives to the standard treatments (ivermectin and diethylcarbamazine citrate), we tested 12 methanolic extracts of nine traditional plant remedies. The extracts (100-0.09 microg/ml) were incubated with 20 Loa loa microfilariae isolated from patients at 37 degrees C with 5% CO(2) in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal serum and antibiotics. Activity was evaluated 120 h later by counting live microfilariae under a microscope. Cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells was estimated by measuring 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2-5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide transformation to formazan at 450 nM in a spectrophotometer. The plants tested were Lophira alata, Greenwayodendron suaveolens, Uapaca togoensis, Zanthoxylum heitzii, Peperomia pellucida, Piptadeniastrum africanum, Petersianthus macrocarpus, Vernonia conferta, and Vernonia hymenolepis. Chemical screening showed that most of the extracts contained reducing sugars, tannin or polyphenols, sterols or triterpenes, saponosides, and alkaloids. None contained carotinoids and few contained flavonoids. The 50% lethal concentration ranged from 0.22 to 70.28 microg/ml, while the 50% inhibitory concentration for eukaryotic cells (IC(50)) ranged from 8.52 to 119.52 microg/ml. Extracts of P. macrocarpus (selectivity index = 72.16), P. africanum (13.69), Z. heitzii (12.11), and L. alata (9.26) were highly selective for L. loa.	p. africanum tannin
2	Herbal medicines used in the treatment of malaria in Budiope county, Uganda.AIM OF THE STUDY: This study was conducted to document herbal medicines (HMs) used in the treatment of malaria as well as the existing knowledge, attitudes and practices related to malaria recognition, control and treatment in Budiope county, Uganda. METHODS: Data was collected using semi-structured interviews, and open- and close-ended questionnaires. RESULTS: The respondents had a good understanding of malaria, and could recognize it and distinguish it from other fever types. They were also aware that malaria was spread by mosquitoes. Malaria prevalence was high, and affected individuals an average of six times a year. Respondents avoided mosquito bites by using mosquito nets, clearing bush around their homesteads, and burning plant parts to generate smoke. They preferred treating malaria using allopathic medicines because, according to them, they lacked the appropriate traditional knowledge necessary to exploit plants for the treatment of malaria. Secondly, allopathic medicines were believed to be superior to HMs in the treatment of malaria. Twenty-seven species were used for the treatment of malaria. The most frequently mentioned were Vernonia amygdalina, Momordica foetida, Zanthoxylum chalybeum, Lantana camara and Mangifera indica. Drugs from these plants were prepared from single species as water extracts and were administered in variable doses over varied time periods.	mangifera indica malaria
2	Fumigant, contact, and repellent activities of essential oils against the darkling beetle, Alphitobius diaperinus.The fumigant, contact, and repellent activities of four essential oils extracted from Citrus limonum (Sapindales: Rutaceae), Litsea cubeba (Laurales: Lauraceae), Cinnamomum cassia, and Allium sativum L. (Asparagales: Alliaceae) against 6th instars and adults of the darkling beetle, Alphitobius diaperinus (Panzer) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), one of the main pests of materials and products of Juncus effuses L. (Poales: Juncaceae) during the storage period, were assayed, and chemical ingredients were analyzed with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in this study. While the major ingredients found in C. limonum and C. cassia were limonene and (E)-cinnamaldehyde, the main constituents of L. cubea were D-limonene, (E)-3,7-dimethyl-,2,6-octadienal, (Z)-3,7-dimethyl,2 ,6-octadienal, and diallyl disulphide (18.20%), while the main constituents of and A. sativum were di-2-propenyl trisulfide and di-2-propenyl tetrasulfide. The fumigation activities of A. sativum and C. limonum on A. diaperinus adults were better than those of the other two essential oilss. The toxicities of A. sativum and C. limonum were almost equitoxic at 96 hr after treatment. Essential oils from Allium sativum and L. cubeba also showed good contact activities from 24 hr to 48 hr, and toxicities were almost equitoxic 48 hr posttreatment. The repellent activities of A. sativum and L. cubeba oils on 6th instars were also observed, showing repellence indexes of 90.4% and 88.9% at 12 hr after treatment, respectively. The effects of A. sativum on AChE activity of 6th instars of A. diaperinus were strongest compared to the other essential oils, followed by C. limonum, L. cubeba, and C. cassia. These results suggest that the essential oils of C. limonum and A. sativum could serve as effective control agents of A. diaperinus.	a. sativum toxicities
1	Metabolic profiles of the Flos Abelmoschus manihot extract by intestinal bacteria from the normal and CKD model rats based on UPLC-Q-TOF/MS.Flos Abelmoschus manihot is a traditional herbal medicine widely used in clinical practice to tackle chronic kidney disease (CKD) for thousands of years. Nowadays, many studies indicate that gut bacteria are closely related to the progression of CKD and CKD-related complications. In this study, a UPLC-Q-TOF/MS method coupled with the MetaboLynx  software was established and successfully applied to investigate the metabolites and metabolic profile of Flos A. manihot extract by intestinal bacteria from normal and CKD rats. Eight parent components and eight metabolites were characterized by their protonated ions. Among these compounds, 15 were detected in the two group samples while M16 was only determined in the CKD model samples. Compared with the quercetin-type glycosides, fewer myricetin-type and gossypetin-type metabolites were obtained in the two group samples. These metabolites suggested that deglycosylation and methylation are the major metabolic pathways of Flos A. manihot extract. Few differences of metabolite classes were observed in the two group samples. However, the concentrations of aglycones such as quercetin, myricetin and gossypetin in the normal samples were notably higher than those in the CKD model samples. The results are important in unravelling the pharmacological effects of A. manihot and clarifying its mechanism of action in vivo.	a. manihot gossypetin
1	The complete amino acid sequences of the B-chains of abrin-a and abrin-b, toxic proteins from the seeds of Abrus precatorius.The amino acids of the B-chains of two abrins (designated as abrin-a and abrin-b) from the seeds of Abrus precatorius have been sequenced. The sequence of the B-chain of abrin-a was solved by analysis of peptides derived by enzymatic digestions with trypsin, lysylendopeptidase, and chymotrypsin, as well as by chemical cleavage with cyanogen bromide. The sequence of the B-chain of abrin-b was analyzed by sequence analysis of tryptic peptides and comparing these sequences with those of corresponding peptides of the B-chain of abrin-a. The B-chains of abrin-a and abrin-b consist of 268 amino acid residues and share 256 identical residues. Comparison of their sequences with that of the ricin B-chain shows that 60% of the residues of both abrin B-chains are identical to those of the ricin B-chain and that two saccharide-binding sites in ricin B-chain identified by a crystallographic study are highly conserved in both abrin B-chains.	abrus precatorius peptides
1	Cinnamomum cassia Presl: A Review of Its Traditional Uses, Phytochemistry, Pharmacology and Toxicology.Cinnamomum cassia Presl is a tropical aromatic evergreen tree of the Lauraceae family, commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine. It is also a traditional spice, widely used around the world. This paper summarizes the achievements of modern research on C. cassia, including the traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacology and toxicology. In addition, this review also discusses some significant issues and the potential direction of future C. cassia research. More than 160 chemicals have been separated and identified from C. cassia. The main constituents of C. cassia are terpenoids, phenylpropanoids, glycosides, etc. Modern studies have confirmed that C. cassia has a wide range of pharmacological effects, including antitumour, anti-inflammatory and analgesic, anti-diabetic and anti-obesity, antibacterial and antiviral, cardiovascular protective, cytoprotective, neuroprotective, immunoregulatory effects, anti-tyrosinase activity and other effects. However, the modern studies of C. cassia are still not complete and more in-depth investigations need to be conducted in alimentotherapy, health product, toxicity and side effects, and more bioactive components and potential pharmacological effects need to be explored in the future.	c. cassia phenylpropanoids
1	Trimer procyanidin oligomers contribute to the protective effects of cinnamon extracts on pancreatic beta-cells in vitro.AIM: Cinnamon extracts rich in procyanidin oligomers have shown to improve pancreatic beta-cell function in diabetic db/db mice. The aim of this study was to identify the active compounds in extracts from two species of cinnamon responsible for the pancreatic beta-cell protection in vitro. METHODS: Cinnamon extracts were prepared from Cinnamomum tamala (CT-E) and Cinnamomum cassia (CC-E). Six compounds procyanidin B2 (cpd1), (-)-epicatechin (cpd2), cinnamtannin B1 (cpd3), procyanidin C1 (cpd4), parameritannin A1 (cpd5) and cinnamtannin D1 (cpd6) were isolated from the extracts. INS-1 pancreatic beta-cells were exposed to palmitic acid (PA) or H2O2 to induce lipotoxicity and oxidative stress. Cell viability and apoptosis as well as ROS levels were assessed. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was examined in PA-treated beta-cells and murine islets. RESULTS: CT-E, CC-E as well as the compounds, except cpd5, did not cause cytotoxicity in the beta-cells up to the maximum dosage using in this experiment. CT-E and CC-E (12.5-50 mug/mL) dose-dependently increased cell viability in both PA- and H2O2-treated beta-cells, and decreased ROS accumulation in H2O2-treated beta-cells. CT-E caused more prominent beta-cell protection than CC-E. Furthermore, CT-E (25 and 50 mug/mL) dose-dependently increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in PA-treated beta-cells and murine islets, but CC-E had little effect. Among the 6 compounds, trimer procyanidins cpd3, cpd4 and cpd6 (12.5-50 mumol/L) dose-dependently increased the cell viability and decreased ROS accumulation in H2O2-treated beta-cells. The trimer procyanidins also increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in PA-treated beta-cells. CONCLUSION: Trimer procyanidins in the cinnamon extracts contribute to the pancreatic beta-cell protection, thus to the anti-diabetic activity.	cinnamon procyanidin
1	Assessment of coumarin levels in ground cinnamon available in the Czech retail market.The objective of this study was to determine the coumarin content of ground cinnamon purchased from retail markets in the Czech Republic. No sample was labelled with information on the botanical source, but, in some cases, the countries of origin were specified. For comparison, a single cinnamon sample imported directly from a plantation in Sri Lanka that came from Cinnamomum verum was analyzed. Results from 60 ground cinnamon samples comprising twelve brands confirmed a high content of coumarin, with mean levels ranging from 2,650 to 7,017 mg   kg(-1). The high coumarin content confirmed that these cinnamon samples obtained from cassia cinnamon were in contrast to the sample from Sri Lanka, which was coumarin-free.	cinnamon coumarin
1	Protective Effect of Selected Medicinal Plants against Hydrogen Peroxide Induced Oxidative Damage on Biological Substrates.Oxidative stress is developed due to susceptibility of biological substrates to oxidation by generation of free radicals. In degenerative diseases, oxidative stress level can be reduced by antioxidants which neutralize free radicals. Primary objective of this work was to screen four medicinal plants, namely, Andrographis paniculata, Costus speciosus, Canthium parviflorum, and Abrus precatorius, for their antioxidant property using two biological substrates-RBC and microsomes. The antioxidative ability of three solvent extracts, methanol (100% and 80%) and aqueous leaf extracts, was studied at different concentrations by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances method using Fenton's reagent to induce oxidation in the substrates. The polyphenol and flavonoid content were analyzed to relate with the observed antioxidant effect of the extracts. The phytochemical screening indicated the presence of flavonoids, polyphenols, tannins, and beta-carotene in the samples. In microsomes, 80% methanol extract of Canthium and Costus and, in RBC, 80% methanol extract of Costus showed highest inhibition of oxidation and correlated well with the polyphenol and flavonoid content. From the results it can be concluded that antioxidants from medicinal plants are capable of inhibiting oxidation in biological systems, suggesting scope for their use as nutraceuticals. 	andrographis paniculata polyphenol
2	Cinnamon and Chronic Diseases.Cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum and Cinnamon cassia), the eternal tree of tropical medicine, belongs to the Lauraceae family and is one of the most important spices used daily by people all over the world. It contains a lot of manganese, iron, dietary fiber, and calcium. Cinnamon contains derivatives, such as cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid, cinnamate, and numerous other components such as polyphenols and antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, anticancer effects. Several reports have dealt with the numerous properties of cinnamon in the forms of bark, essential oils, bark powder, and phenolic compounds, and each of these properties can play a key role in human health. Recently, many trials have explored the beneficial effects of cinnamon in Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, arthritis, and arteriosclerosis, but still we need further investigations to provide additional clinical evidence for this spice against cancer and inflammatory, cardioprotective, and neurological disorders.	cinnamon arthritis
3	In vitro cytotoxic activity of isolated acridones alkaloids from Zanthoxylum leprieurii Guill. et Perr.Chemical investigation of the roots and fruits of Zanthoxylumleprieurii Guill. et Perr. led to the isolation of three new alkaloids including two acridone derivatives, 3-hydroxy-1,4-dimethoxy-10-methyl-9-acridone (2) and 3-hydroxy-1,2-dimethoxy-10-methyl-9-acridone (3) named helebelicine A and B, respectively, and one secobenzo[c]phenantridine, 10-O-demethyl-12-O-methylarnottianamide (10), together with thirteen other compounds. The structures of compounds 2, 3 and 10 as well as those of the known compounds were elucidated by using spectroscopic methods and by comparison with reported data. The brine-shrimp (artemia salina) lethality bioassay of the chloroform extract of the fruits showed modest cytotoxicity with LD(50) at 13.1microg/mL. Isolated compounds 1, 4-6 were found to be moderately active against lung carcinoma cells (A549), colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (DLD-1) and normal cells (WS1) with IC(50) values ranging from 27 to 77microM. In contrast to the positive control etoposide used, the cytotoxicity of the most active compound 4 was found to be selective against cancer cells in comparison to normal cells WS1 with IC(50) of 51+/-8microM and 4.3+/-0.4microM, respectively.	acridones alkaloids lung carcinoma
1	Synergistic antioxidant activity of green tea with some herbs.Cardiovascular diseases, cancer, arthritis, etc. are caused by free radicals that are byproducts of metabolic pathways. Selected plants namely Vitis vinifera, Phyllanthus emblica L., Punica granatum, Cinnamomum cassia, Ginkgo biloba L., and Camellia sinensis Linn. are reported to produce antioxidant property. This study is undertaken to support the hypothesis that formulation of a polyherbal combination of these plants shows a synergistic effect with green tea. The extracts of each drug were characterized by phytochemical studies and tests for phenolics and flavonoids. In vitro antioxidant activity for individual drug and its combination was determined by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), superoxide, and nitric oxide free radical scavenging methods. Our results suggest that a combination of all these herbs with green tea can synergistically enhance antioxidant activity and thus lower doses of each herb with green tea may be used. Antioxidant potential of polyherbal combination was also comparable to that of standard ascorbic acid. Studies showed that selected individual plants contained abundant quantity of phenolics and flavonoids and their polyherbal combination with green tea was found to produce best antioxidant activity among all individual extracts. This will help in avoiding undesirable side effects due to higher doses of single herb.	phyllanthus emblica l flavonoids
1	Fumigant toxicity of cassia and cinnamon oils and cinnamaldehyde and structurally related compounds to Dermanyssus gallinae (Acari: Dermanyssidae).The toxicity of two cassia oils, four cinnamon oils and (E)-cinnamaldehyde and (E)-cinnamic acid and 34 structurally related compounds to adult Dermanyssus gallinae (De Geer) collected from a poultry house was examined using a vapour-phase mortality bioassay. Results were compared with those of dichlorvos, a conventional acaricide. The cassia and cinnamon oils (cinnamon technical, cinnamon #500, cassia especial, cassia true, cinnamon bark and cinnamon green leaf) exhibited good fumigant toxicity (LD(50), 11.79-26.40 mug cm(-3)). alpha-Methyl-(E)-cinnamaldehyde (LD(50), 0.45 mug cm(-3)) and (E)-cinnamaldehyde (0.54 mug cm(-3)) were the most toxic compounds and the toxicity of these compounds was comparable to that of dichlorvos (0.30 mug cm(-3)). Potent fumigant toxicity was also observed in allyl cinnamate, ethyl-alpha-cyanocinnamate, (E)-2-methoxylcinnamic acid and (Z)-2-methoxylcinnamic acid (LD(50), 0.81-0.92 mug cm(-3)). Structure-activity relationships indicate that structural characteristics, such as types of functional groups and carbon skeleton rather than vapour pressure parameter, appear to play a role in determining toxicity. The essential oils and compounds described merit further study as potential acaricides for the control of D. gallinae populations as fumigants with contact action due to global efforts to reduce the level of highly toxic synthetic acaricides in the agricultural environment.	cinnamon ethyl-alpha-cyanocinnamate
1	Silver fir (Abies alba) trunk extract protects guinea pig arteries from impaired functional responses and morphology due to an atherogenic diet.BACKGROUND: Diet, rich in plant polyphenols prevents atherogenesis that manifests as reduced vascular relaxation and formation of plaques. HYPOTHESIS: Atherosclerosis could be reduced by the intake of silver fir (Abies alba) extract (SFTE), rich in polyphenols. STUDY DESIGN: Chronic, in vivo treatment animal study. METHODS: Guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) were fed for 8 weeks with one of the following three diets: atherogenic, basic or atherogenic + SFTE. After isolation, we measured the relaxation and contractile responses of the thoracic aorta. Additionally, we measured the area of fatty plaques on the aortic walls. RESULTS: Compared to the basic diet, the atherogenic diet decreased the ability of the aorta to relax by 63% (p &lt; 0.001). The addition of SFTE to the atherogenic diet improved the aorta relaxation response compared to that of the atherogenic diet without SFTE (the decrease relative to the basic diet was 26%, p &lt; 0.001). The aorta contractility did not differ between the groups. The SFTE group generated significantly fewer atherosclerotic plaques than did the atherogenic group. The areas of atherosclerotic plaques were 7.4, 0.3 and 1.6% in the aortas of guinea pigs receiving atherogenic, basic or atherogenic + SFTE diets, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In a guinea pig model, prolonged treatment with antioxidative polyphenol-rich SFTE prevents aortic functional and morphological changes caused by an atherogenic diet.	abies alba polyphenol
2	Secondary metabolites from the root wood of Zanthoxylum wutaiense and their antitubercular activity.Bioassay-guided fractionation of the root wood of Zanthoxylum wutaiense led to the isolation of five new compounds, wutaipyranol A (1), 8-methoxywutaipyranol A (2), demethoxywutaiensal (3), demethoxywutaiensol (4), and dihydrodemethoxywutaiensol (5), together with six known compounds. Their structures were elucidated by 1D- and 2D-NMR, as well as MS analyses. Among the isolates, wutaipyranol A (1), 8-methoxywutaipyranol A (2), and demethoxywutaiensal (3) exhibited antitubercular activities against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H(37) Rv in vitro, with MIC values of 52.4, 55.6, and 45.8 mug/ml, respectively.	zanthoxylum wutaiense wutaipyranol a
1	New polyunsaturated fatty acid amides isolated from the seeds of Zanthoxylum piperitum.Five linear fatty acid amides (1-5) of the sandshool class, including two new compounds, were isolated from Zanthoxylum piperitum seeds.

1	Three new compounds from Cinnamomum cassia.Three new compounds, including two new diterpenoids, named epianhydrocinnzeylanol (1) and cinnacasiol H (2), and one hydroxylasiodiplodin, (3R,4S,6R)-4,6-dihydroxy-de-O-methyllasiodiplodin (3), together with five known diterpenoids (4-8) and two known phenolic glycosides (9-10) were isolated from the barks of Cinnamomum cassia. Their structures were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analysis and comparison of the chemical shift values with those of related known compounds. The anti-inflammatory activities of the isolates were evaluated on nitric oxide production in lipopolysaccharide-induced BV-2 microglial cells and the compounds showed weak inhibition activities. 	cinnamomum cassia diterpenoids
1	The Use of Essential Oils and Their Isolated Compounds for the Treatment of Oral Candidiasis: A Literature Review.In this literature review, we present the main scientific findings on the antifungal activity of essential oils (EOs) applicable for a new drug formulation to treat oral candidiasis. Seven literature databases were systematically searched for eligible in vitro and clinical trials. Selected articles were screened for biological activity, botanical species, phytochemical composition, study design, and methodological quality. A total of 26 articles were included in the review, of which 21 were in vitro studies and 5 clinical trials. The most promising EOs were obtained from Allium tubeorosum, Cinnamomum cassia, Cinnamomum zeylanicum, and Coriandrum sativum L. Among the phytochemicals, citral and thymol were the most active. Clinical trials indicated that the EOs from Pelargonium graveolens and Zataria multiflora are potentially effective to treat oral candidiasis. Further nonclinical and clinical studies with these EO are warranted to determine their potential use and safety for the treatment of oral candidiasis.	cinnamomum cassia EOs

2	Antioxidative effects of Cinnamomi cassiae and Rhodiola rosea extracts in liver of diabetic mice.Both Cinnamomi cassiae and Rhodiola rosea extracts are used as anti-diabetic folk medicines. Recently, increased oxidative stress was shown to play an important role in the etiology and pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus and its complications. This study was designed to examine the effects of Cinnamomi cassiae and Rhodiola rosea extracts on blood glucose, lipid peroxidation, the level of reduced glutathione and its related enzymes (glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase), and the activity of the antioxidant enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase) in the liver of db/db mice. Diabetic C57BL/Ks db/db mice were used as experimental models. Mice were divided into control (n=10), Cinnamomi cassiae (200 mg/kg/day, n=10), and Rhodiola rosea (200 mg/kg/day, n=10) treated groups for 12 weeks of treatment. These type II diabetic mice were used to investigate the effects of Cinnamomi cassiae and Rhodiola rosea on blood glucose, reduced glutathione, glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase, lipid peroxidation, catalase and superoxide dismutase. Cinnamomi cassiae and Rhodiola rosea extracts significantly decreased on blood glucose, increased levels of reduced glutathione and the activities of glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase in the liver. Extract treatment also significantly decreased lipid peroxidation. Cinnamomi cassiae and Rhodiola rosea extracts may be effective for correcting hyperglycemia and preventing diabetic complications.	rhodiola rosea diabetic complications
1	Topical antiinflammatory activity of the major lipophilic constituents of the rhizome of Zingiber cassumunar. Part I: The essential oil.The essential oil of the rhizome of Zingiber cassumunar was found to exhibit a topical antiinflammatory effect, when tested using the model of carrageenan-induced hind paw edema in rats (ID(50) = 22 mg oil/paw). Individual assessment of topical antiinflammatory activity of the five major components of the oil demonstrated that (E)-1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)butadiene (DMPBD), terpinen-4-ol and alpha-terpinene significantly inhibited edema formation, whereas sabinene and gamma-terpinene were inactive up to 6 mg/paw. The most active compound, DMPBD, was found to be an antiinflammatory agent twice as potent as the reference drug diclofenac (ID(50) = 3 vs 6 mg/paw, respectively).	zingiber cassumunar diclofenac
2	Water-extracted branch of Cinnamomum cassia promotes lung cancer cell apoptosis by inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase activity.Cinnamomum cassia Blume has been widely reported as the anti-tumor agent. However, the precise mechanism underlying its pro-apoptotic action is still not clear. Restraining aerobic glycolysis through suppression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDHK) is a promising strategy for cancer inhibition. In this study, we performed to investigate the anti-tumor action of C. cassia is mediated by PDHK inhibition. The inhibition of water-extracted branch of C. cassia (WBCC) on the activity of PDHK using both in vitro and cell-based kinase assay were examined in several lung cancer cells. WBCC reduced viabilities of several lung cancer cells with minimal cytotoxicity on normal bronchial epithelial cells. WBCC decreased lactate production through inhibiting activity of PDHK. In consequence of PDHK inhibition, WBCC increased ROS production, which damage mitochondria membrane stability. In addition, WBCC induced ROS- and mitochondria-dependent apoptotic cell death. Among the components of WBCC, cinnamic acid was founded as a major inhibitor on PDHK activity. This is first report that WBCC induces apoptosis of lung cancer cells through inhibiting PDHK activity. Our findings suggest that WBCC and cinnamic acid can be potential candidates for developing novel anti-cancer drugs through glycolysis metabolism.	cinnamic acid cancer

1	[Effect of flavonoids from Abelmoschus manihot on proliferation, differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocyte and insulin resistance].Abelmoschus manihot was rich in flavonoids, which has been reported the activity on protecting angiocarpy and improving renal function. This study aimed to explore the action mechanism of five flavonoids from A. manihot on how to ameliorating insulin resistance through the regulation of the glucose and expression of PPARgamma, C/EBPalpha, SREBP-1, resistin, visfatin, adiponectin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. After the 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were differentiated into mature adipocytes, insulin resistance model was built. Insulin resistance adipocytes were treated with 5, 100 mumol L-1 quercetin, isoquercitrin, hyperoside, quercitrin-3'-O-glucoside, gossypetin-8-O-beta-glucoside. The glucose was indirectly determined by BCA kit. The mRNA expression levels of PPARgamma, C/EBPalpha, SREBP-1, resistin, visfatin, adiponectin were detected by real-time quantitative PCR. Results showed that five flavonoids at 5 mumol L-1 could accelerate preadipocytes proliferation and inhibit that at 100 mumol L-1 Compared with the normal group, glucose uptake reduced significantly in model group (P&lt;0.01). With the treatment of five flavonoids at 100 mumol L-1, glucose consumption increased significantly (P&lt;0.01). The high expression of PPARgamma, C/EBPalpha, adiponectin expression was significantly increased (P&lt;0.01), and low expression of SREBP-1, resistin, visfatin after respective administration with five flavonoids at 100 mumol L-1 promoted adipocyte differentiation. This study showed that, HY, JY, QT, QG, GG can control preadipocytes proliferation, promote adipocyte differentiation and regulate the expression of relative factors with lipid metabolism, such as PPARgamma, C/EBPalpha, SREBP-1, adiponectin, resistin, visfatin, increasing glucose utilization and improving insulin resistance in 3T3-L1 adipocyte.	a. manihot quercetin
1	Metabolism of hibifolin by human intestinal bacteria.Hibifolin, the highest-content bioactive flavonoid of the flowers of Abelmoschus manihot, was incubated with human intestinal bacteria, and four metabolites (1-4) were obtained from the incubated solution by chromatographic methods. The structures of the four metabolites were elucidated as gossypetin 8-O-beta-D-4''-deoxy- Delta(4'')-glucuropyranoside (1), gossypetin (2), quercetin (3), and 8-methoxy-quercetin (4), respectively, on the basis of UV, NMR, and MS data. Metabolite 1 was obtained as a new compound with a specific beta-D-4''-deoxy-Delta(4'')-glucuropyranosyl moiety, which was formed through a unique and novel metabolic pathway that has not been reported previously.	abelmoschus manihot 8-methoxy-quercetin
1	Microwave-assisted extraction of jujube polysaccharide: Optimization, purification and functional characterization.The operational parameters involved in microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) of jujube polysaccharide including microwave power, water to raw material ratio and extraction temperature and time were optimized by RSM. MAE at 400W, 75 C, 60 min, using 30 g water/g powdered jujube was the best condition for maximum yield (9.02%) of polysaccharide. Two novel water-soluble polysaccharides (JCP-1 and JCP-2) with average molecular weights of 9.1x10(4)-1.5x10(5)Da in term of the symmetrical narrow peaks were identified using the analytical purification procedures. The JCP-1 and JCP-2 mainly composed of glucose, arabinose, galactose and rhamnose in molar ratios of 1.4:2.1:4.2:0.9 and 1.2:1.8:4.1:1.1, respectively. The use of 1.5% JCP-1 led to a high emulsifying stability (95.5%) in a model oil-in-water type emulsion with a reduced surface tension (44.1 mN/m) and droplet size (1.32 mum), and an increased apparent viscosity (0.13 Pas) during 21-day cold storage. The antioxidant activities were increased in dose-dependent manners (25-200 mug/mL).	jujube arabinose
1	Ethno botanical and Phytophrmacological potential of Abrus precatorius L.: A review.Medicinal plants are being widely used, either as a single drug or in combination in health care delivery system. Medicinal plants can be important source of previously unknown chemical substances with potential therapeutic effects. Abrus precatorius L. is commonly known as Gunja or Jequirity and abundantly found all throughout the plains of India, from Himalaya down to Southern India and Ceylon. This plant is having medicinal potential to cure various diseases. The roots, leaves and seeds of this plant are used for different medicinal purpose. It principally contains flavonoids, triterpene glycosides, abrin and alkaloids. The plant have been reported for neuromuscular effects, neuro-protective, abortifacient, antiepileptic, anti-viral, anti-malarial, antifertility, nephroprotective, immunomodulator, immunostimulatory properties, anti-inflammatory activity, antidiabetic effect, etc. As this is a potential medicinal plant, present review reveals chemical constituents of leaf, root and seeds of Abrus precatorius. The plant is considered as a valuable source of unique natural products for development of medicines against various diseases and also for the development of industrial products. 	abrus precatorius flavonoids
2	An Arrow Poison (Abrus Precatorius) Causing Fatal Poisoning in a Child.Ingestion of whole seeds of Abrus precatorius often does not produce serious illness. It generally presents initially with gastrointestinal manifestations. Haemolysis, acute renal damage, hepatotoxicity and seizures are the other manifestations. Herewith we report a child with accidental ingestion of abrus precatorius seeds who presented with altered sensorium and convulsions. The case is being reported on account of its rarity in its initial neurological manifestation and has not been reported earlier in paediatric age group. 	abrus precatorius Haemolysis
1	Invasion inhibitors of human fibrosarcoma HT 1080 cells from the rhizomes of Zingiber cassumunar: structures of phenylbutanoids, cassumunols.The methanolic extract and its EtOAc-soluble fraction from the rhizomes of Zingiber cassumunar inhibited invasion of human fibrosarcoma HT 1080 cells. From the EtOAc-soluble fraction, eight new phenylbutanoids, cassumunols A-H, were isolated together with 30 known constituents. The structures of new phenylbutanoids were elucidated on the basis of chemical and physicochemical evidence. Principal constituents were examined the inhibitory effects on the invasion of HT 1080 cells. Among them, phlain I and III, (E)-1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)buta-1,3-diene, (E)-1-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)buta-1,3-diene, and (-)-beta-sesquiphellandrene showed anti-invasion effects. Interestingly, (E)-1-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)buta-1,3-diene [inhibition (%) 46.8 +- 7.2 (p&lt;0.05) at 30 microM] significantly inhibited the invasion, and only a weak cytotoxic effect was observed.	zingiber cassumunar (-)-beta-sesquiphellandrene
2	Abrin poisoning.Abrin is a toxic protein obtained from the seeds of Abrus precatorius (jequirity bean), which is similar in structure and properties to ricin. Abrin is highly toxic, with an estimated human fatal dose of 0.1-1 microgram/kg, and has caused death after accidental and intentional poisoning. Abrin can be extracted from jequirity beans using a relatively simple and cheap procedure. This satisfies one criterion of a potential chemical warfare agent, although the lack of large scale production of jequirity seeds means that quantity is unavailable for ready mass production of abrin for weapons. This contrasts with the huge cultivation of Ricinus seeds for castor oil production. At the cellular level, abrin inhibits protein synthesis, thereby causing cell death. Many of the features observed in abrin poisoning can be explained by abrin-induced endothelial cell damage, which causes an increase in capillary permeability with consequent fluid and protein leakage and tissue oedema (the so-called vascular leak syndrome). Most reported cases of human poisoning involve the ingestion of jequirity beans, which predominantly cause gastrointestinal toxicity. Management is symptomatic and supportive. Experimental studies have shown that vaccination with abrin toxoid may offer some protection against a subsequent abrin challenge, although such an approach is unlikely to be of benefit in a civilian population that in all probability would be unprotected.	abrus precatorius death
3	Antinociceptive Activity of Zanthoxylum piperitum DC. Essential Oil.Zanthoxylum piperitum DC. (ZP) is a traditional medicinal plant used mainly in countries from Asia such as Japan. This study aimed to investigate the antinociceptive effect of ZP essential oil (ZPEO). The major component present in the essential oil was beta-phellandrene (29.39%). Its antinociceptive activity was tested through animal models (formalin-, capsaicin-, and glutamate-induced paw licking and hot plate). The anti-inflammatory effect was evaluated through the carrageenan-induced leukocyte migration into the subcutaneous air pouch (SAP), with measurement of cytokines. The results showed antinociceptive effect for ZPEO for the first phase of the formalin-induced licking, glutamate, and hot plate tests. However, ZPEO had no effect on reducing paw licking induced by capsaicin. Finally, ZPEO had no effect against inflammation induced by carrageenan. 	essential oil inflammation
2	[Experimental research on prevention and treatment of fatty liver rats with Abrus cantoniensis].OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of Abrus cantoniensis (AC) on blood lipid metabolism, pathomorphological change of the liver and fenestrae of liver sinus endothelial cell (LSEC) in fatty liver disease rats. METHODS: SD rats were divided into 7 groups: blank control group,fatty liver model group, simvastatin group (7.2 mg/kg), Gynostemma pentaphyllum group (16.2 mg/kg), high dose (40 g/kg), middle dose (20 g/kg) and low dose (10 g/kg) of AC groups. All rats except blank control group were fed with high fat diet for the first 3 weeks, then treated with different conditions as previously mentioned for the next 3 weeks while keep on feeding with high fat diet. At the 43rd day,the abdominal aortic blood was collected for measuring the serum concentration of AST, ALT, TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, and liver tissues were taken to make pathological sections for observation by optical microscope or were prepared for scanning electronic microscope. RESULTS: The levels of AST, ALT, TC, TG, LDL-C were obviously decreased while HDL-C were increased in fatty liver rats by AC high dose. Meanwhile the cell morphology of liver tissues and the fenestraes of LSEC were improved as well. CONCLUSION: AC can ameliorate the levels of blood lipid in fatty liver rats and improve the pathological change of liver tissues. To some extent AC has the function of prevention and treatment of fatty liver.	abrus cantoniensis fatty liver disease
2	Herbal medicines used in the treatment of malaria in Budiope county, Uganda.AIM OF THE STUDY: This study was conducted to document herbal medicines (HMs) used in the treatment of malaria as well as the existing knowledge, attitudes and practices related to malaria recognition, control and treatment in Budiope county, Uganda. METHODS: Data was collected using semi-structured interviews, and open- and close-ended questionnaires. RESULTS: The respondents had a good understanding of malaria, and could recognize it and distinguish it from other fever types. They were also aware that malaria was spread by mosquitoes. Malaria prevalence was high, and affected individuals an average of six times a year. Respondents avoided mosquito bites by using mosquito nets, clearing bush around their homesteads, and burning plant parts to generate smoke. They preferred treating malaria using allopathic medicines because, according to them, they lacked the appropriate traditional knowledge necessary to exploit plants for the treatment of malaria. Secondly, allopathic medicines were believed to be superior to HMs in the treatment of malaria. Twenty-seven species were used for the treatment of malaria. The most frequently mentioned were Vernonia amygdalina, Momordica foetida, Zanthoxylum chalybeum, Lantana camara and Mangifera indica. Drugs from these plants were prepared from single species as water extracts and were administered in variable doses over varied time periods.	vernonia amygdalina malaria
1	Zanthoxylum ailanthoides Sieb and Zucc. extract inhibits growth and induces cell death through G2/M-phase arrest and activation of apoptotic signals in colo 205 human colon adenocarcinoma cells.The effects of 50% ethanolic stem extracts of Zanthoxylum ailanthoides Sieb and Zucc. (ZASZ) on the cell viability, cell cycle and apoptosis were investigated in a human colon adenocarcinoma cell line (colo 205). The results demonstrated that ZASZ induced morphological changes and decreased the cell viability. ZASZ promoted Wee1, checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2), p21 and p53 levels, decreased cyclin B and cdc25c associated with that led to G(2)/M phase arrest. ZASZ-triggered apoptosis was confirmed by 4' -6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining and DNA gel electrophoresis. ZASZ increased the levels of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and growth arrest and DNA damage inducible gene 153 (GADD153), and promoted an increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca(2+) release, and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) accompanied by cytochrome c release that was due to the decrease of Bcl-2 and increase of Bax levels in the colo 205 cells. ZASZ also induced the protein levels of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and endonuclease G (Endo G), increased the levels of caspase-3, -7 and -9, and stimulated the levels of fatty acid synthase (Fas) and Fas ligand in the colo 205 cells. ZASZ contains phenolic compounds, including flavone, chlorogenic acid and isofraxidin, among which, flavone was found to be the most effective in reducing cell viability and proliferative responses in the colo 205 cells. ZASZ induces cytotoxicity and apoptosis in colo 205 cells which provides the rationale for studies in animal models on the utilization of ZASZ as a potential cancer therapeutic compound.	zanthoxylum ailanthoides flavone
1	Phytochemical and biological activities of four wild medicinal plants.The fruits of four wild plants, namely, Capparis decidua, Ficus carica, Syzygium cumini, and Ziziphus jujuba, are separately used as traditional dietary and remedial agents in remote areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. The results of our study on these four plants revealed that the examined fruits were a valuable source of nutraceuticals and exhibited good level of antimicrobial activity. The fruits of these four investigated plants are promising source of polyphenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, and saponins. These four plants' fruits are good sources of iron, zinc, copper, manganese, selenium, and chromium. It was also observed that these fruits are potential source of antioxidant agent and the possible reason could be that these samples had good amount of phytochemicals. Hence, the proper propagation, conservation, and chemical investigation are recommended so that these fruits should be incorporated for the eradication of food and health related problems. 	ficus carica flavonoids
3	Acute demyelinating encephalitis due to Abrus precatorius poisoning--complete recovery after steroid therapy.INTRODUCTION: Poisoning from Abrus precatorius is attributed to a toxalbumin (abrin) that acts by inhibiting protein synthesis and rarely can cause immuno-mediated demyelination. We report a case of abrin poisoning with demyelination. CASE REPORT: A 19-year-old man presented with a history of ingesting crushed Abrus precatorius seeds following a family quarrel. He developed vomiting, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea, followed by a seizure and an altered sensorium. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed demyelination in the bilateral-medial temporal lobes. The patient was treated with supportive care, and intravenous methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisone, and recovered fully. DISCUSSION: Abrin is an immuno-modulator that may cause immune-mediated demyelination. We report the clinical course of a patient with demyelination after abrin poisoning, treated with corticosteroids, and document his clinical recovery. CONCLUSION: Demyelination is a rare complication of Abrus precatorius poisoning. In our case, the demyelination was demonstrated by MRI. Although our patient appeared to recover completely following methylprednisolone therapy, the suggestion that methylprednisolone or other corticosteroids might be useful in treating this demyelination needs experimental verification and clinical validation before concluding that it is a beneficial therapy.	toxalbumin demyelination
1	In vitro assessment of synergistic combinations of essential oils against Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus (Acari: Ixodidae).Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus (Acari: Ixodidae), is one of the most important ectoparasite of cattle, responsible for causing severe economic losses in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The development of resistance to most of the commonly used chemical acaricides has stimulated the search for new herbal products as an eco-friendly tick control alternative. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro acaricidal activity of essential oils (EOs) of cloves (Syzygium aromaticum), bark of cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum) and leaves of lemon grass (Cymbopogon citratus) against unfed larvae of R. (B.)microplus by larval packet test. Also, various combinations were prepared by mixing of equal concentrations of any two and all three EOs and used to study the effects of interactions of mixtures against larvae of R. (B.) microplus. The lethal concentrations at 50% (LC50), 90% (LC90) and 99% (LC99) with 95% confidence limits (CL) were estimated by Probit analysis using PoloPlus. The computer software, CompuSyn, was used for determining the effects of interactions (synergistic, additive or antagonistic) of EO mixtures by calculation of Combination index (CI) and Dose-reduction index (DRI). Among the individual and mixture of two EOs, cinnamon EO and cinnamon EO + lemon grass EO combination showed highest acaricidal activity against R. (B.) microplus larvae. Further, the combination of cinnamon EO + lemon grass EO showed high synergism with CI value of 0.381, followed by cinnamon EO + clove EO showing moderate synergism whereas, clove EO + lemon grass EO showed only additive effect, with favorable dose reduction for each constituent drug in all three combinations. The combination of all three EOs (1:1:1) showed high synergism (CI value of 0.376) and favorable dose reduction (DRI index of 8.19, 25.64 and 4.64 for clove, cinnamon and lemon grass EOs, respectively) against R. (B.) microplus larvae.	cinnamon essential oils
1	The chemical composition and nutritional potential of the tribal pulse, Abrus precatorius L.The boiled seeds of Abrus precatorius L. are eaten by the residents of the Andaman Islands in India. The seeds were analysed for proximate composition, total (true) protein, seed protein fractions, amino acid profile of seed proteins, minerals and certain antinutritional factors. The seed proteins are rich in most of the essential amino acids, and they are deficient only in cystine and threonine, when compared to the WHO/FAO requirement pattern. The antinutritional factors (total free phenols, tannins, trypsin inhibitor activity and haemagglutinating activity) were also investigated.	abrus precatorius phenols
1	Anti-inflammatory activities of essential oils and their constituents from different provenances of indigenous cinnamon (Cinnamomum osmophloeum) leaves.CONTEXT: Cinnamomum osmophloeum Kaneh. (Lauraceae) is one of the indigenous tree species in Taiwan. This tree species has been of interest to researchers because the chemical constituents of its essential oil are similar to those of Cinnamomum cassia Presl. bark oil, known as cinnamon oil, which is commonly used in foods and beverages. OBJECTIVE: The anti-inflammatory activities of the leaf essential oils and their major compounds from seven provenances of C. osmophloeum are investigated here for the first time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chemical compositions of hydrodistilled essential oils obtained from C. osmophloeum leaves were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and the effects of essential oils on nitric oxide (NO) production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated RAW 264.7 macrophages were investigated. RESULTS: The leaf essential oils of cinnamaldehyde type and mixed type strongly inhibited NO production, with IC(50) values ranging from 9.7-15.5 mug/mL. Furthermore, trans-cinnamaldehyde is responsible for the inhibitory activity of cinnamaldehyde type, and T-cadinol and alpha-cadinol are responsible for the inhibitory activity of mixed type. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that the leaf essential oils and their constituents of C. osmophloeum have excellent anti-inflammatory activities and thus have great potential as a source for natural health products.	c. osmophloeum essential oils
1	Residue analysis and risk assessment of tebuconazole in jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill).In this study, a sensitive and reliable analytical method, based on a modified Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe procedure, was established for determination of tebuconazole in jujube. After extraction with acetonitrile, the samples were cleaned up by dispersive solid-phase extraction with primary secondary amine, and determined by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. At fortification levels of 0.01, 0.1 and 2.0 mg kg-1 , the average recoveries of tebuconazole in jujube were in the range 97.6-101.9%, with relative standard deviations of 1.5-3.5%. The dissipation and residual levels of tebuconazole in jujube under field conditions were investigated. Tebuconazole dissipated relatively slowly in jujube, with a half-life of 33.0 days. The terminal residue experiments of tebuconazole in jujube were conducted in four locations in China and the risk was evaluated using risk quotients (RQ). RQ values were found to be significantly lower than RQ = 1, indicating that the risk to human health of using the recommended doses of tebuconazole in jujube was not significant. This study could provide guidance for the safe and reasonable use of tebuconazole in jujube and serve as a reference for the establishment of limit of maximum residue in China.	jujube tebuconazole
1	[GC-MS analysis and cytotoxic activity of the supercritical extracts from roots and stems of Zanthoxylum nitidum].The volatile components of roots and stems of Zanthoxylum nitidum were investigated by supercritical fluid carbon dioxide extraction (SFE-CO2) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry(GC-MS). Thirty-one and fifty-one compounds were identified in the supercritical extracts from roots and stems of Z. nitidum, respectively, and total twenty-seven compounds were the common constituents. Among them, the major constituents in root and stem supercritical extracts were spathulenol (18.49 and 26.18%), n-hexadecanoic acid (14.24% and 12.79%), ar-tumerone (6.95% and 8.88%), oleic acid (8.39% and 5.71%) and hexanoic acid (4.39% and 7.78%). The in-vitro MTT assay showed that the volatile components of roots and stems of Z. nitidum did not exhibited any cytotoxic activity against human cancer Huh-7 and normal IEC-6 cells. These results indicated the same nature of the volatile constituents in the root and stem of Z. nitidum. This investigation may provide further evidence for expansion of medicinal parts of Z. nitidum.	z. nitidum spathulenol
1	Investigations on the antibacterial effect of conifer needle oils on bacteria isolated from the feces of captive Capercaillies (Tetrao urogallus L., 1758).In winter, free-living Capercaillies feed almost exclusively upon needles of various conifer species. An important part of the energy and protein requirements of captive Capercaillies, however, is supplied by food rich in starch and proteins. The fecal flora of captive Capercaillies is considerably different from the flora of free-living Capercaillies. Bacterial diseases are frequent in captivity. The aim of the present study is to determine whether the essential oils from conifer needles possess antibacterial properties against several bacteria, some of which are facultatively pathogenic for Capercaillies. Needles of Pinus sylvestris contain few tannins, which could be a reason for the Capercaillies' preference for these needles. The needles of Abies alba contain high amounts of tannins and essential oils, which could explain the refusal of Capercaillies to eat these needles. The antibacterial effect of commercially available essential oils on the bacteria is investigated with a filter paper disc method and in a liquid medium. The essential oils possess a bacteriostatic or a bactericidal effect against some of the tested bacteria. Feeding on natural forage plants may help prevent the colonization of the intestines by facultatively pathogenic bacteria. The authors discuss why Capercaillies, especially young birds that are to be released, should be fed with natural forage plants.	abies alba essential oils
1	(E)-4-(3,4-Dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-en-1-ol Enhances Melanogenesis through Increasing Upstream Stimulating Factor-1-Mediated Tyrosinase Expression.We investigated the potential melanogenic effect of compounds from Zingiber cassumunar Roxb. Our data revealed that chloroform-soluble extract of Z. cassumunar enhanced melanin synthesis in B16F10 melanoma cells. Among the components of the chloroform extract, (E)-4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-en-1-ol (DMPB) increased melanogenesis in both B16F10 cells and human primary melanocytes. In B16F10 cells, DMPB enhanced the activation of ERK and p38, and the level of tyrosinase. Although the level of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor was unchanged in DMPB-treated B16F10 cells, DMPB increased levels and nuclear localization of upstream stimulating factor-1 (USF1). Consistently, DMPB-mediated melanin synthesis was diminished in USF1-knockdown cells. Furthermore, DMPB induced hyperpigmentation in brown guinea pigs in vivo. Together, these data suggest that DMPB may promote melanin synthesis via USF1 dependent fashion and could be used as a clinical therapeutic agent against hypopigmentation-associated diseases. 	z. cassumunar (E)-4-(3,4-Dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-en-1-ol
1	Anti-complementary activity of triterpenoides from fruits of Zizyphus jujuba.In order to determine on the anti-complement activity of triterpenes, following eleven triterpenoides were isolated from the fruits of the Zizyphus jujuba MILL: ceanothane-type triterpenes: colubrinic acid (1), zizyberenalic acid (11); lupane-type triterpenes: alphitolic acid (2), 3-O-cis-p-coumaroyl alphitolic acid (3), 3-O-trans-p-coumaroyl alphitolic acid (4), betulinic acid (7), betulonic acid (9); and oleanane-type triterpenes: 3-O-cis-p-coumaroyl maslinic acid (5), 3-O-trans-p-coumaroyl maslinic acid (6), oleanolic acid (8), oleanonic acid (10). These compounds were examined for their anti-complement activity against the classical pathway of the complement system. Among them, compounds 5, 6, and 8 exhibited significant anti-complement activity with IC(50) values of 101.4, 143.9, and 163.4 microM, respectively, whereas the ceanothane-type and the lupane-type triterpenes were inactive. This suggests that the oleanane-structure plays an important role in inhibiting the hemolytic activity of human serum against erythrocytes.	zizyphus jujuba lupane
1	Potent modulation of P-glycoprotein activity by naturally occurring phenylbutenoids from Zingiber cassumunar.Five phenylbutenoid derivatives from the rhizomes of Zingiber cassumunar Roxb. (Zingiberaceae) were evaluated for their P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitory effects in a P-gp over-expressing multidrug resistant (MDR) human breast cancer cell line, MCF-7/ADR. As a result, a phenylbutenoid dimer, (+/-)-trans-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-[(E)-3,4-dimethoxystyryl]cyclohex-1-ene (1), exhibited highly potent P-gp inhibitory activity, decreasing the IC(50) value of daunomycin (DNM) to 4.31 +/- 0.40 microm in the cells (DNM IC(50) = 37.1 +/- 0.59 microm). The positive control, verapamil decreased the IC(50) value of DNM to 6.94 +/- 0.40 microm. Three phenylbutenoid monomers, 2-4 from this plant, also resulted in a significant decrease in the IC(50) values of DNM compared with the control. In particular, compound 1 markedly enhanced [(3)H]-DNM accumulation and significantly reduced [(3)H]-DNM efflux compared with the control, and this effect was more potent than that of verapamil, a well-known P-gp inhibitor. These results suggest that compound 1 of Z. cassumunar can be developed as a potent chemo-sensitizing agent that reverses P-gp-mediated MDR in human cancer chemotherapy.	z. cassumunar phenylbutenoid
1	New fatty acid esters originate during storage by the interaction of components in prasaplai, a Thai traditional medicine.Prasaplai is a Thai traditional preparation composed of twelve ingredients; during storage three newly emerging compounds were detected by HPLC. Their structures were established as the new (E)-4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-en-1-yl linoleate, (E)-4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-en-1-yl oleate and the known (E)-4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-en-1-yl palmitate on the basis of spectral data and chemical evidence. The artificial esters were already observable after one day of storage of the freshly prepared dry mixture, and steadily increased during a storage period of 30 days and more. A systematic search indicated that the three esters arose from the interaction of compounds contained in the rhizomes of Zingiber cassumunar and the seeds of Nigella sativa.	zingiber cassumunar (e)-4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-en-1-yl linoleate
1	Cinnamon extract induces tumor cell death through inhibition of NFkappaB and AP1.BACKGROUND: Cinnamomum cassia bark is the outer skin of an evergreen tall tree belonging to the family Lauraceae containing several active components such as essential oils (cinnamic aldehyde and cinnamyl aldehyde), tannin, mucus and carbohydrate. They have various biological functions including anti-oxidant, anti-microbial, anti-inflammation, anti-diabetic and anti-tumor activity. Previously, we have reported that anti-cancer effect of cinnamon extracts is associated with modulation of angiogenesis and effector function of CD8+ T cells. In this study, we further identified that anti-tumor effect of cinnamon extracts is also link with enhanced pro-apoptotic activity by inhibiting the activities NFkappaB and AP1 in mouse melanoma model. METHODS: Water soluble cinnamon extract was obtained and quality of cinnamon extract was evaluated by HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) analysis. In this study, we tested anti-tumor activity and elucidated action mechanism of cinnamon extract using various types of tumor cell lines including lymphoma, melanoma, cervix cancer and colorectal cancer in vitro and in vivo mouse melanoma model. RESULTS: Cinnamon extract strongly inhibited tumor cell proliferation in vitro and induced active cell death of tumor cells by up-regulating pro-apoptotic molecules while inhibiting NFkappaB and AP1 activity and their target genes such as Bcl-2, BcL-xL and survivin. Oral administration of cinnamon extract in melanoma transplantation model significantly inhibited tumor growth with the same mechanism of action observed in vitro. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that anti-tumor effect of cinnamon extracts is directly linked with enhanced pro-apoptotic activity and inhibition of NFkappaB and AP1 activities and their target genes in vitro and in vivo mouse melanoma model. Hence, further elucidation of active components of cinnamon extract could lead to development of potent anti-tumor agent or complementary and alternative medicine for the treatment of diverse cancers.	cinnamomum cassia carbohydrate
1	Tree species effects on decomposition and forest floor dynamics in a common garden.We studied the effects of tree species on leaf litter decomposition and forest floor dynamics in a common garden experiment of 14 tree species (Abies alba, Acer platanoides, Acer pseudoplatanus, Betula pendula, Carpinus betulus, Fagus sylvatica, Larix decidua, Picea abies, Pinus nigra, Pinus sylvestris, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Quercus robur, Quercus rubra, and Tilia cordata) in southwestern Poland. We used three simultaneous litter bag experiments to tease apart species effects on decomposition via leaf litter chemistry vs. effects on the decomposition environment. Decomposition rates of litter in its plot of origin were negatively correlated with litter lignin and positively correlated with mean annual soil temperature (MAT(soil)) across species. Likewise, decomposition of a common litter type across all plots was positively associated with MAT(soil), and decomposition of litter from all plots in a common plot was negatively related to litter lignin but positively related to litter Ca. Taken together, these results indicate that tree species influenced microbial decomposition primarily via differences in litter lignin (and secondarily, via differences in litter Ca), with high-lignin (and low-Ca) species decomposing most slowly, and by affecting MAT(soil), with warmer plots exhibiting more rapid decomposition. In addition to litter bag experiments, we examined forest floor dynamics in each plot by mass balance, since earthworms were a known component of these forest stands and their access to litter in litter bags was limited. Forest floor removal rates estimated from mass balance were positively related to leaf litter Ca (and unrelated to decay rates obtained using litter bags). Litter Ca, in turn, was positively related to the abundance of earthworms, particularly Lumbricus terrestris. Thus, while species influence microbially mediated decomposition primarily through differences in litter lignin, differences among species in litter Ca are most important in determining species effects on forest floor leaf litter dynamics among these 14 tree species, apparently because of the influence of litter Ca on earthworm activity. The overall influence of these tree species on leaf litter decomposition via effects on both microbial and faunal processing will only become clear when we can quantify the decay dynamics of litter that is translocated belowground by earthworms.	lumbricus terrestris lignin
1	Zanthoxylum caribaeum (Rutaceae) essential oil: chemical investigation and biological effects on Rhodnius prolixus nymph.A chemical investigation and bioassays against fifth-instar nymphae of the hematophagous insect Rhodnius prolixus, vector of Chagas disease, were conducted with the essential oil from Zanthoxylum caribaeum. The main results may be summarized as follows: (i) 54 components were identified, corresponding to 90.4% of the relative composition; sesquiterpenes (47.3%) and monoterpenes (41.2%) are the major constituents; (ii) muurola-4,5-trans-diene and isodaucene are described for the first time as chemical constituents of the essential oil from leaves of this species; (iii) topical treatment with the crude essential oil induced high levels of paralysis (from 18.88 to 33.33%) and mortality (from 80 to 98.9%) depending on the dose applied (0.5 to 5.0 mul per insect); (iv) feeding treatment with the crude essential oil also induced high levels of mortality (from 48.8 to 100%) but low levels of paralysis (from 2.22 to 7.77%) depending on the dose applied (0.5 to 5.0 mul/ml of blood); (v) in the continuous treatment, only the dose of 5.0 mul/cm(2) was able to promote statistical significant levels of mortality (63.3%) but no paralysis were detected. However in this group, occasionally, only few insects displayed malformations of legs and wings after treatment; and (vi) any treatment was able to disrupt the metamorphosis process since the low adult stage emergence observed to all groups was due the high insect mortality. These observations suggest the interference of Z. caribaeum compounds on the triatomine neuroendocrine system. The significance of these results in relation to the relevant biological events in R. prolixus as well as the possible use of insect growth regulators present in Z. caribaeum oil in integrated vector control programs against hematophagous triatomine species is herein discussed.	r. prolixus essential oil
3	Inhibitory effect of Zanthoxylum bungeanum seed oil on ovalbumin-induced lung inflammation in a murine model of asthma.The present study aimed to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of Zanthoxylum bungeanum seed oil (Z. seed oil) to alleviate airway inflammation in asthmatic mice. The asthmatic mice were treated with vehicle, ovalbumin (OVA), or OVA + Z. seed oil (2 g/kg) for between 24 h and 14 days. Following treatment, inflammatory cell infiltration and pulmonary tissue damage were assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining, and immunohistochemistry. The expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules and mitogen activated protein kinase signaling proteins were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, reverse transcription quantitative-polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. In asthmatic mice, administration of Z. seed oil attenuated lung tissue injury and airway remodeling, and inhibited the infiltration of leukocytes and eosinophils into the airway by reducing the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines compared with OVA-treated mice (P&lt;0.05). Z. seed oil also reduced the levels of inflammatory chemokine and adhesion molecules via downregulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and activation of c-JUN N-terminal kinase in the Z. seed-treated mice compared with OVA-treated mice (P&lt;0.05). Thus, data from the present study indicates that Z. seed oil can suppress pulmonary inflammation and tissue injury during asthma, and suggests that it may be used to effectively treat allergen-induced asthma. 	z. seed oil asthma
1	Screening for in vitro metabolites of Abelmoschus manihot extract in intestinal bacteria by ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry.Abelmoschus manihot has drawn much attention recently due to its potential beneficial health effects after oral administration. However, the metabolic fate of A. manihot in intestinal flora is not well understood. In this paper, we describe a strategy using ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF MS) with automated data analysis software (MetaboLynx ) for fast analysis of the metabolic profile of flavonoids from A. manihot in intestinal flora. The human and rat incubated samples collected 72 h in the anaerobic incubator were analyzed by UPLC-Q-TOF MS within 10 min. A total of 14 metabolites were identified in human and rat incubated solution compared with blank samples. The results indicated that hydrolysis, hydroxylation and acetylation were the major metabolic pathways of flavonoids in A. manihot extract in vitro. MS(E) was used for simultaneous acquisition of precursor ion information and fragment ion data at high and low collision energy in one analytical run, which facilitated the fast structural characterization of metabolites. This work demonstrated the potential of the UPLC-Q-TOF MS approach using Metabolynx for fast and automated identification of metabolites of natural product in intestinal flora.	a. manihot flavonoids
2	Antimicrobial effect of extracts from Chinese chive, cinnamon, and corni fructus.Extracts were prepared from Chinese chive (Allium tuberosum), cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia), and corni fructus (Cornus officinalis) and used to evaluate their antimicrobial activity on common foodborne microorganisms, alone and in combination. The mixed extract, consisting of three extracts in equal volumes, showed an entire antimicrobial spectrum and had excellent stability to heat, pH, and storage. The mixed extract exhibited better inhibition on growth of Escherichia coli than potassium sorbate at 2-5 mg/mL. The mixed extract inhibited the growth of Pichia membranaefaciens at levels as low as 2 mg/mL. When the mixed extract was used in foods, the expected antimicrobial effect in orange juice, pork, and milk was observed. After gel filtration chromatography, each extract was partially purified into fractions, and one fraction in each extract showed enhanced antimicrobial activity. Overall, the mixed extract was of promising potential for incorporation into various food products for which a natural antimicrobial additive is desired.	cinnamomum cassia antimicrobial activity
1	Purification, structural characterization, and hypolipidemic effects of a neutral polysaccharide from Ziziphus Jujuba cv. Muzao.A neutral polysaccharide (PZMP1) with a molecular weight of 16.97 kDa was isolated from Ziziphus Jujuba cv. Muzao with water extraction, ethanol precipitation, and purification with DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow and Sephacryl S-300 column chromatography. PZMP1 was structurally characterized with high-performance gel-permeation chromatography, gas chromatography, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, methylation analysis, NMR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. The results show that PZMP1 is a homogeneous heteropolysaccharide composed of arabinose, galactose, glucose, mannose, and xylose in a molar percentage of 17.36: 3.29:2.68:1.05:1.00. The majorly backbone of PZMP1 is composed of 1,3,5-linked Araf, 1,3-linked Araf, 1,5-linked Araf, 1,4-linked Glcp, and 1-linked Araf, 1-linked Glcp. According to an NMR analysis, the repeating unit of PZMP1 is a linear backbone with branches at positions O-3, and O-5. PZMP1 also displays effective dose-dependent hypolipidemic activity, suggesting that it is a natural hypolipidemic agent, which could contribute to the functional food qualities of jujube fruit.	jujube polysaccharide
1	Antibacterial compounds from Zanthoxylum rhetsa.A new amide, zanthorhetsamide (1), along with nine known compounds (2-10) was isolated from the roots and stem barks of Zanthoxylum rhetsa. The structure was characterized by spectroscopic methods. In addition, the antibacterial activity of the isolates was evaluated. Dihydrochelerythrine (4) exhibited strong activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus SK1 and moderate activity against Escherichia coli TISTR 780 with MIC values of 8 and 16 mug/mL, respectively.	zanthoxylum rhetsa zanthorhetsamide
1	Insecticidal and fumigant activities of Cinnamomum cassia bark-derived materials against Mechoris ursulus (Coleoptera: attelabidae).The insecticidal and fumigant activities of Cinnamomum cassia (Blume) bark-derived materials against the oak nut weevil (Mechoris ursulus Roelofs) were examined using filter paper diffusion and fumigation methods and compared to those of the commercially available Cinnamomum bark-derived compounds (eugenol, salicylaldehyde, trans-cinnamic acid, and cinnamyl alcohol). The biologically active constituent of the Cinnamomum bark was characterized as trans-cinnamaldehyde by spectroscopic analysis. In a test with the filter paper diffusion method, trans-cinnamaldehyde showed 100 and 83.3% mortality at rates of 2.5 and 1.0 mg/filter paper, respectively. At 2.5 mg/paper, strong insecticidal activity was produced from eugenol (90.0% mortality) and salicylaldehyde (88. 9%), whereas trans-cinnamic acid revealed moderate activity (73.3%). At 5 mg/paper, weak insecticidal activity (50.0%) was produced from cinnamyl alcohol. In a fumigation test, the Cinnamomum bark-derived compounds were much more effective against M. ursulus larvae in closed cups than in open ones. These results indicate that the insecticidal activity of test compounds was attributable to fumigant action, although there is also significant contact toxicity. As a naturally occurring insect-control agent, the Cinnamomum bark-derived materials described could be useful as a new preventive agent against damage caused by M. ursulus.	Cinnamomum eugenol
1	Antitumor activity of 2-hydroxycinnamaldehyde for human colon cancer cells through suppression of beta-catenin signaling.The antiproliferative and antitumor activities of 2-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (1), a phenylpropanoid isolated from the bark of Cinnamomum cassia, were investigated using human colorectal cancer cells. Compound 1 exhibited antiproliferative effects in HCT116 colon cancer cells, accompanied by modulation of the Wnt/beta-catenin cell signaling pathway. This substance was found also to inhibit beta-catenin/T-cell factor (TCF) transcriptional activity in HEK293 cells and HCT116 colon cancer cells. Further mechanistic investigations in human colon cancer cells with aberrantly activated Wnt/beta-catenin signaling showed that 1 significantly suppressed the binding of beta-catenin/TCF complexes to their specific genomic targets in the nucleus and led to the down-regulation of Wnt target genes such as c-myc and cyclin D1. In an in vivo xenograft model, the intraperitoneal administration of 1 (10 or 20 mg/kg body weight, three times/week) for four weeks suppressed tumor growth in athymic nude mice implanted with HCT116 colon cancer cells significantly, without any apparent toxicity. In an ex vivo biochemical analysis of the tumors, compound 1 was also found to suppress Wnt target genes associated with tumor growth including beta-catenin, c-myc, cyclin D1, and survivin. The suppression of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway is a plausible mechanism of action underlying the antiproliferative and antitumor activity of 1 in human colorectal cancer cells. 	cinnamomum cassia 2-hydroxycinnamaldehyde
2	Repellency of aromatic medicinal plant extracts and a steam distillate to Aedes aegypti.The repellent activity of methanol extracts from 23 aromatic medicinal plant species and a steam distillate against female blood-starved Aedes aegypti was examined in the laboratory by skin test and compared with that of N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (deet). Responses varied according to plant species. At a dose of 0.1 mg/cm2, the repellency of extracts of Cinnamomum cassia bark (91%), Nardostachys chinensis rhizome (81%), Paeonia suffruticosa root bark (80%), and Cinnamomum camphora steam distillate (94%) was comparable to deet (82%). The duration of the effectiveness for extracts from C. cassia bark and N. chinensis rhizome was comparable to deet and lasted for approximately 1 h. Relatively short duration of repellency was observed in P. suffruticosa root bark extract and C. camphora steam distillate. The plants described merit further study as potential mosquito repellent agents.	c. cassia mosquito repellent
1	Trans-cinnamaldehyde improves neuroinflammation-mediated NMDA receptor dysfunction and memory deficits through blocking NF-kappaB pathway in presenilin1/2 conditional double knockout mice.A chronic neuroinflammatory response has been considered as a critical pathogenesis promoting neurodegenerative progression in Alzheimer's disease (AD). During neuroinflammatory process, microglia are excessively activated and simultaneously release numerous pro-inflammatory mediators that cause synaptic dysfunction in the forebrain prior to neuronal degeneration and memory deficits in AD. Thus, prevention of neuroinflammation-mediated synaptic dysfunction may be a potential therapeutic approach against neurodegenerative disorders. Trans-cinnamaldehyde (TCA) is a primary bioactive component derived from the stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia, and it possesses potent anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities in in vivo and in vitro experiments. However, the in-depth molecular mechanisms of TCA underlying anti-neuroinflammatory and neuroprotective effects on memory deficits in AD are still unclear. The presenilin 1 and 2 conditional double knockout (PS cDKO) mice exhibit AD-like phenotypes including obvious neuroinflammatory responses and synaptic dysfunction and memory deficits. Here, PS cDKO were used to evaluate the potential neuroprotective effects of TCA against neuroinflammation-mediated dementia by performing behavioral tests, electrophysiological recordings and molecular biology analyses. We observed that TCA treatment reversed abnormal expression of synaptic proteins and tau hyperphosphorylation in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of PS cDKO mice. TCA treatment also ameliorated NMDA receptor (NMDAR) dysfunction including impaired NMDAR-mediated responses and long-term potentiation (LTP) induction in the hippocampus of PS cDKO mice. Moreover, TCA possesses an ability to suppress neuroinflammatory responses by diminishing microglial activation and levels of pro-inflammatory mediators in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of PS cDKO mice. Importantly, improving NMDAR dysfunction and memory deficits of PS cDKO mice was due to the inhibition of neuroinflammatory responses through TCA's interruptive effect on the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway. Therefore, TCA may be a potential anti-neuroinflammatory agent for deterring neurodegenerative progression of AD.	cinnamomum cassia TCA
2	Insect repellent activity of medicinal plant oils against Aedes aegypti (Linn.), Anopheles minimus (Theobald) and Culex quinquefasciatus Say based on protection time and biting rate.This study investigated insect bite protection and length of the protection with 30 repellents which were divided into 3 categories: plant oil, essential oil and essential oil with ethyl alcohol, tested against three mosquito species, Aedes aegypti, Anopheles minimus and Culex quinquefasciatus, under laboratory conditions. The plant oil group was comprised of Phlai (Zingiber cassumunar) and Sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum). Both substances were effective as repellents and feeding deterrents against An. minimus (205 minutes protection time and a biting rate of 0.9%), Cx. quinquefasciatus (165 minutes protection time and 0.9% biting rate) and Ae. aegypti (90 minutes protection time and 0.8% biting rate). Essential oil from citronella grass (Cymbopogon nardus) exhibited protection against biting from all 3 mosquito species: for An. minimus, Cx. quinquefasciatus and Ae. aegypti, the results were 130 minutes and 0.9%, 140 minutes and 0.8%, and 115 minutes and 0.8%, respectively. The period of protection time against Ae. aegypti for all repellent candidates tested was lower than the Thai Industrial Standards Institute (TISI) determined time of greater than 2 hours.	zingiber cassumunar essential oil
1	Non-cell-autonomous postmortem lignification of tracheary elements in Zinnia elegans.Postmortem lignification of xylem tracheary elements (TEs) has been debated for decades. Here, we provide evidence in Zinnia elegans TE cell cultures, using pharmacological inhibitors and in intact Z. elegans plants using Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy, that TE lignification occurs postmortem (i.e., after TE programmed cell death). In situ RT-PCR verified expression of the lignin monomer biosynthetic cinnamoyl CoA reductase and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase in not only the lignifying TEs but also in the unlignified non-TE cells of Z. elegans TE cell cultures and in living, parenchymatic xylem cells that surround TEs in stems. These cells were also shown to have the capacity to synthesize and transport lignin monomers and reactive oxygen species to the cell walls of dead TEs. Differential gene expression analysis in Z. elegans TE cell cultures and concomitant functional analysis in Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in identification of several genes that were expressed in the non-TE cells and that affected lignin chemistry on the basis of pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis. These data suggest that living, parenchymatic xylem cells contribute to TE lignification in a non-cell-autonomous manner, thus enabling the postmortem lignification of TEs.	z. elegans lignin
2	Plants used to treat epilepsy by Tanzanian traditional healers.A cross-sectional study performed in Temeke District (Dar es Salaam, Tanzania) showed that 5.5% of the traditional healers have knowledge for the treatment of epilepsy. Of the 100 healers interviewed, 30 (30%) believed that epilepsy was caused by witchcraft, while 19 (19%) thought epilepsy has a genetic origin which can be inherited. Other healers thought epilepsy can be caused by head injury or malaria (24%), and the remaining 27% did not know the cause. Most of the healers (92%) could present an accurate account on the symptoms of the disease, including dizziness, loss of consciousness, abrupt falling down, frothing from the mouth, loss of memory, biting of the tongue, confusion, and restlessness. They showed competence in the treatment of the disease, whereby 60 plants that are commonly used were mentioned. Abrus precatorius L. (Leguminosae), Clausena anisata (Willd.) Oliv. (Rutaceae) and Hoslundia opposita Vahl (Lamiaceae), which are among the plants mentioned, have proven anticonvulsant activity, while a few other species on their list have been reported to be useful in the treatment of epilepsy. Biological testing of these plants, using different models of convulsions is, suggested.	abrus precatorius epilepsy
0	Compounds from Sichuan and Melegueta peppers activate, covalently and non-covalently, TRPA1 and TRPV1 channels.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Oily extracts of Sichuan and Melegueta peppers evoke pungent sensations mediated by different alkylamides [mainly hydroxy-alpha-sanshool (alpha-SOH)] and hydroxyarylalkanones (6-shogaol and 6-paradol). We assessed how transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) and TRP vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), two chemosensory ion channels, participate in these pungent sensations. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The structure-activity relationships of these molecules on TRPA1 and TRPV1 was measured by testing natural and synthetic analogues using calcium and voltage imaging on dissociated dorsal root ganglia neurons and human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing the wild-type channels or specific cysteine mutants using glutathione trapping as a model to probe TRPA1 activation. In addition, using Trpv1 knockout mice, the compounds' aversive responses were measured in a taste brief-access test. KEY RESULTS: For TRPA1 activation, the cis C6 double bond in the polyenic chain of alpha-SOH was critical, whereas no structural specificity was required for activation of TRPV1. Both 6-shogaol and 6-paradol were found to activate TRPV1 and TRPA1 channels, whereas linalool, an abundant terpene in Sichuan pepper, activated TRPA1 but not TRPV1 channels. Alkylamides and 6-shogaol act on TRPA1 by covalent bonding whereas none of these compounds activated TRPV1 through such interactions. Finally, TRPV1 mutant mice retained sensitivity to 6-shogaol but were not responsive to alpha-SOH. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The pungent nature of components of Sichuan and Melegueta peppers was mediated via interactions with TRPA1 and TRPV1 channels and may explain the aversive properties of these compounds.	6-shogaol TRPA1
1	Simultaneous determination of three flavonoid C-glycosides in mice biosamples by HPLC-ESI-MS method after oral administration of Abrus mollis extract and its application to biodistribution studies.A simple HPLC-ESI-MS method was developed for the determination of vicenin-2 (1), isoschaftoside (2), and schaftoside (3) of Abrus mollis extract in mice plasma and tissues (heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys). The separation was achieved by HPLC on a Shim-Pack CLC-ODS column with a mobile phase composed of 0.1% formic acid (mobile phase A, 72%) and methanol-isopropanol (9:1) (mobile phase B, 28%). The electrospray source of the MS was operated in the selective ion monitoring (SIM) mode at m/z 593 ([M-H]-) for 1, and 563 ([M-H]-) for 2 and 3, respectively. The limit of detection (LOD) of 1-3 was in the range of 8.5-12.6 ng/mL for plasma, and 32.5-49.4 ng/g for tissue tested. The limit of quantification (LOQ) was found to be 25 ng/mL for plasma, and 100 ng/g for tissue. The calibration curves were linear in all matrices (r2 &gt; 0.994) in the concentration range of 25-500 ng/mL in plasma or 100-1250 ng/g in tissue, respectively. Intra-day and inter-day precision studies demonstrate that the method is precise with coefficients of variation intra-day and inter-day below 5.9 and 7.4% for all the samples, respectively. The recoveries of three flavonoid C-glycosides ranged from 95.3 to 106.4% for plasma, and 92.6 to 107.3% for tissues. Following oral administration of A. mollis extract to mice at a dose of 72 mg/kg, the concentrations of 1-3 in plasma and tissues were quantifiable in bio-samples collected up to 180 min. The method described is suitable for studies on the distribution of three flavonoid C-glycosides of A. mollis extract in plasma and different tissues of mice.	abrus mollis schaftoside
1	Differential antiproliferation effect of 2'-benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde in K-ras-transformed cells via downregulation of thiol antioxidants.2'-Benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde (BCA), one of the derivatives of 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (HCA) isolated from the bark of Cinnamomum cassia, induces apoptosis in human cancer cells. We found that BCA induces stronger antiproliferative effects in K-ras-transformed cells (RK3E-ras) than in isogenic non-transformed cells (RK3E). Treatment of RK3E-ras with BCA resulted in increased ROS generation and depletion of intracellular glutathione, whereas BCA-treated RK3E showed no significant increase in the ROS level with concurrent increase in intracellular glutathione (GSH). Thiol antioxidants recovered cell proliferation inhibition caused by BCA in both cell lines, while non-thiol antioxidants failed to recover cell death. BCA decreased metallothionein (MT) expression in RK3E-ras, while inducing remarkable MT expression in RK3E. The increase of intracellular GSH in RK3E is partially caused by differential induction of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS) due to BCA treatment. To evaluate the upstream pathway for differential expression of gamma-GCS and MT, we analyzed early DJ-1 (PARK7) and NF-E2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) changes after BCA treatment. In RK3E, DJ-1 expression considerably increased for 3 h with concurrent induction of Nrf2, whereas in RK3E-ras cells BCA decreased these protein levels. Based on these findings, it seems that the therapeutic selectivity of BCA in RK3E-ras results from decreased thiol antioxidants via decreased DJ-1 and Nrf2 expression.	cinnamomum cassia HCA
2	ZPDC glycoprotein inhibits inflammation-related cytokine and protein via nuclear factor-kappa B in dextran sulfate sodium-stimulated ICR mouse.The purpose of this study is to investigate the anti-inflammatory potentials of a 24-kDa glycoprotein isolated from Zanthoxylum piperitum DC fruit (ZPDC glycoprotein) in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-stimulated ICR mouse colitis. ZPDC glycoprotein was administered to mice at 10 and 20 mg/kg for 7 days and then the mice were co-treated with 5% DSS for another 7 days in presence of ZPDC glycoprotein and killed on day 15. The results showed that ZPDC glycoprotein has inhibitory effects on levels of disease activity index and large intestine shortening in DSS-treated mice. In addition, ZPDC glycoprotein suppresses the formation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, production of inducible nitric oxide, and release of lactate dehydrogenase in DSS-treated mice plasma. Interestingly, we found that consumption of ZPDC glycoprotein (20 mg/kg) significantly inhibited the expressions of interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and cyclooxygenase-2 via modulation of transcriptional activity of nuclear factor-kappa B in DSS-treated mice colon. Collectively, these results suggest that ZPDC glycoprotein is useful for prevention of inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases.	zanthoxylum piperitum colitis
2	Efficacy and safety of Flos Abelmoschus manihot (Malvaceae) on type 2 diabetic nephropathy: A systematic review.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Flos Abelmoschus manihot (Malvaceae) on type 2 diabetic nephropathy (DN). METHODS: The Cochrane Library, PubMed/MEDLINE, Excerpta Medical Database, Chinese electronic literature databases, and the references of relevant articles were searched in March 2012 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that reported the effects of Flos A. manihot on type 2 DN patients with overt but subnephrotic-range proteinuria (500-3,500 mg/24 h). The quality of trials was evaluated using the Cochrane-recommended method. The results were summarized as risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes or mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes. RESULTS: Seven trials (531 patients) were included. Flos A. manihot significantly decreased proteinuria [MD -317.32 mg/24 h, 95% confidence interval (CI) [-470.48, -164.17],P&lt;0.01]. After excluding a trial that only included patients with well-preserved renal function, Flos A. manihot was associated with a significant decrease in serum creatinine (MD -11.99 mumol/L, 95% CI [-16.95, -7.04],P&lt;0.01). Serious adverse events were not observed. The most common adverse event was mild to moderate gastrointestinal discomfort; however, patients receiving this herb did not have an increased risk for tolerated gastrointestinal discomfort (RR 1.48, 95% CI [0.39, 5.68],P=0.57). CONCLUSIONS: Flos A. manihot may be considered as an important adjunctive therapy with the first-line and indispensable therapeutic strategies for type 2 DN. High-quality RCTs are urgently needed to confirm the effect of Flos A. manihot on definite endpoints such as end-stage renal disease.	a. manihot diabetic nephropathy
1	Composition of essential oils from seeds of Abies koreana.The essential oils from seeds of nine Abies koreana specimens have been studied using GC-MS-FID and NMR methods, leading to the determination of 96 volatiles, which constituted over 99% of the oils. The hydrodistilled oils of fresh, resinous scent were isolated with yields in the range of 3.8-8.5%. The results showed that the essential oil of Korean fir seeds contained 70-95% monoterpenes and 1-20% oxygenated monoterpenes as the dominant groups. The numerous sesquiterpenes, diterpenes and their oxygenated derivatives constituted only 2-8% of the oil. The major component of the seed essential oil was limonene (41-72 g/100g); the laevorotary form of this terpene predominated. A. koreana seeds seem to be a rich source of both essential oil and (-)-limonene, whose average enantiomeric excess was above 95%.	a. koreana terpene
2	Cassia cinnamon for the attenuation of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance resulting from sleep loss.Epidemiological investigations reveal a concomitant increase in sleep loss and metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, over the past several decades. An increasing body of scientific evidence indicates that acute sleep loss induces insulin resistance and glucose intolerance profiles similar to those of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. Experimentally, cassia cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia) supplementation facilitates glucose disposal in healthy humans, which may be achieved by enhancing (1) insulin sensitivity via increased phosphorylation of signaling proteins and (2) insulin-sensitive glucose transporter 4-mediated glucose uptake into muscle cells. Because peripheral insulin resistance is primarily a consequence of reduced muscle insulin sensitivity, C. cassia and C. cassia extracts may attenuate insulin resistance and glucose intolerance observed following sleep loss.	cinnamon sleep loss
1	Apoptosis inducing activity of benzophenanthridine-type alkaloids and 2-arylbenzofuran neolignans in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells.Thirteen compounds belonging to different classes of alkaloids (1-9) and lignans (10-13), isolated from the methanol extract of roots of the African medicinal plant Zanthoxylum capense, were assayed for their ability as apoptosis inducers in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells. The cytotoxicity of these compounds was evaluated in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells by the MTS assay. Out of the tested compounds, three benzophenanthridine alkaloids (1, 4, and 7), a dibenzyl butyrolactone lignan (10), and two 2-arylbenzofuran neolignans (12 and 13) displayed significant cytotoxicity to HCT116 cells, confirmed by the Guava ViaCount viability assay. The selected compounds (1, 4, 7, 10, 12, and 13) were further tested for apoptosis induction activity in HCT116 cells, by evaluation of nuclear morphology following Hoechst staining, and by caspase-3 like activity assays. Morphologic evaluation of HCT116 nuclei following Hoechst staining and fluorescence microscopy revealed that compounds 1, 4, 7, 10, 12, and 13 induced apoptosis in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells, producing similar, or higher, apoptosis levels when compared with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), the cornerstone cytotoxic used in colon cancer treatment for several decades. In fact, HCT116 cells developed morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis, including chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation and formation of apoptotic bodies. Importantly, compounds 4 and 13 at 20 muM were the most promising in this study, inducing respectively ~11- and 7-fold increases in apoptotic cells as compared to vehicle control, whereas 5-FU increased apoptosis by ~2-fold. Apoptosis induction for compounds 4 and 13 was further confirmed by caspase-3-like activity assays, which showed respectively ~2- and 1.5-fold increases in caspase-3-like activity compared to vehicle control. These results suggested that specific benzophenanthridine alkaloids and 2-arylbenzofuran neolignans isolated from Zanthoxylum capense show strong anticancer activity in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells.	zanthoxylum capense benzophenanthridine
1	Fine root decomposition rates do not mirror those of leaf litter among temperate tree species.Elucidating the function of and patterns among plant traits above ground has been a major research focus, while the patterns and functioning of belowground traits remain less well understood. Even less well known is whether species differences in leaf traits and their associated biogeochemical effects are mirrored by differences in root traits and their effects. We studied fine root decomposition and N dynamics in a common garden study of 11 temperate European and North American tree species (Abies alba, Acer platanoides, Acer pseudoplatanus, Carpinus betulus, Fagus sylvatica, Larix decidua, Picea abies, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Quercus robur, Quercus rubra and Tilia cordata) to determine whether leaf litter and fine root decomposition rates are correlated across species as well as which species traits influence microbial decomposition above versus below ground. Decomposition and N immobilization rates of fine roots were unrelated to those of leaf litter across species. The lack of correspondence of above- and belowground processes arose partly because the tissue traits that influenced decomposition and detritus N dynamics different for roots versus leaves, and partly because influential traits were unrelated between roots and leaves across species. For example, while high hemicellulose concentrations and thinner roots were associated with more rapid decomposition below ground, low lignin and high Ca concentrations were associated with rapid aboveground leaf decomposition. Our study suggests that among these temperate trees, species effects on C and N dynamics in decomposing fine roots and leaf litter may not reinforce each other. Thus, species differences in rates of microbially mediated decomposition may not be as large as they would be if above- and belowground processes were working in similar directions (i.e., if faster decomposition above ground corresponded to faster decomposition below ground). Our results imply that studies that focus solely on aboveground traits may obscure some of the important mechanisms by which plant species influence ecosystem processes.	abies alba lignin
2	A comparative antibacterial evaluation of raw and processed Gunja (Abrus precatorius Linn.) seeds.BACKGROUND: Seed of Gunja (Abrus precatorius Linn.), a known poisonous drug, is used extensively in various ayurvedic formulations with great therapeutic significance. Ayurveda recommends the administration of Gunja in diseases like Indralupta (alopecia), Sotha (edema), Krmi (helminthes), Kustha (skin diseases), Kandu (itching), Prameha (urinary disorders) etc., after being treated with specific Sodhana (purification) procedures. OBJECTIVE: To assess the antimicrobial action of of raw and Shodhita (Processed) Gunja seeds. METHODS: Gunja seeds after being processed with Godugdha (cow's milk), Nimbu swarasa (Lemon juice), Kanji (Sour gruel) and water, as the media, were evaluated for its antibacterial effect against clinically important bacterial strains using agar well diffusion method. RESULTS: Aqueous extracts of raw seeds of Gunja exert its antibacterial effect on both Gram positive, as well as Gram negative bacteria but none of the Sodhita Gunja seeds showed any bactericidal effect on any bacterial strains. Chloroform extracts of all the Sodhita Gunja seed extracts could inhibit bacterial growth but with variations. CONCLUSION: The study displayed that chloroform extracts of raw and sodhita samples for bacterial study were much sensitive than the aqueous extracts.	abrus precatorius edema
2	The in-vitro antimicrobial activity of Abrus precatorius (L) fabaceae extract on some clinical pathogens.OBJECTIVES: To investigate the in-vitro antimicrobial activities of the extracts of Abrus precatorius on some clinical isolates as resistance to available and affordable antibiotics by these pathogens is on the increase. METHOD: In this study the antimicrobial effects of the extracts of Abrus precatorius from leaves, stem and the seed oil were tested against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, three clinical S. aureus isolates from different sources, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus anginosus (S.milleri), Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium spp (toxigenic strain of the mitis biotype), Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as Candida albicans using the agar well diffusion technique. Aqueous and methanolic extraction, using the soxhlet extractor was carried out on all plant parts used while petroleum ether was the solvent used to extract the seed oil. To measure the MIC values, various concentrations of the stock, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8 and 4 microg/ml were assayed against the test bacteria. RESULT: At the different concentrations of the extracts used (512 microg/ml - 4 microg/ml), Staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive organism with an MIC of 8 ug/ml for the leaf extract. Extract from the stem and seed oil were potent against some of the gram-positive bacteria and Candida albicans but not against S anginosus, E. faecalis and gram-negative bacteria tested. The pH of the extracts ranged between pH5 and pH8. This study demonstrates that Abrus precatorius particularly the seed oil has a potent antimicrobial activity. CONCLUSION: The results substantiate the ethno botanical use of different parts of Abrus precatorius for the treatment of various bacteria-related diseases. Topical application of Abrus precatorius extracts in ointments may be recommended especially for treating superficial infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus.	abrus precatorius antimicrobial activity
1	Derivatives of the Lignan 7'-Hydroxymatairesinol with Antioxidant Properties and Enhanced Lipophilicity.The lignan 7'-hydroxymatairesinol (1), extracted from the knotwoods of fir (Abies alba), spruce (Picea abies), and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), exhibited unexpected reactivity when esterification reactions were attempted on the hydroxy group at position C-7'. To circumvent the rapid intramolecular cyclization procedure, leading quantitatively to the lignan conidendrin (7), a simple strategy for 7'-esterification of 1 under mild conditions (three steps, up to 80% overall yield) was developed. Compared to hydroxymatairesinol (1) (log K'w = 1.49), the derivatives (2-5) had increased lipophilicity with log K'w &gt; 3.1, as determined by a UHPLC method. Compounds 1-5 exhibited potent antioxidant properties in the same range as the standards ascorbic acid and alpha-tocopherol (IC50 = 20-25 muM) and higher than that of BHT using a DPPH radical-scavenging assay.	abies alba lignan 7'-hydroxymatairesinol
2	Clinical effects of Zingiber cassumunar (Plai): A systematic review.Zingiber cassumunar Roxb. known locally as "Plai" in Thai, has been used for treating bruise, sprain and musculoskeletal pain. Several pre-clinical studies demonstrated the anti-inflammatory effect of Plai. However, current evidence of clinical effects of Plai is still unclear. This study aimed to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of Plai among all identified indications. Of the 808 articles identified by a systematic review, six studies were included. Four studies were randomized controlled trials, while two studies were quasi-experimental studies involving 178 patients in intervention group and 177 patients in control group. Duration of treatment ranged from 7days to 2 months. Our findings showed that 14% Plai cream had a strong trend of benefits in pain reduction for muscle pain and ankle sprain. However, evidence supporting the effects of Plai on acne vulgaris treatment and anti-histamine effect are still unclear.	zingiber cassumunar roxb pain
1	Volatile organic nitrogen-containing constituents in ambrette seed Abelmoschus moschatus Medik (Malvaceae).A detailed investigation of the basic fraction of a CO2 extract of ambrette seeds (Abelmoschus moschatus) revealed a total of 58 nitrogen-containing compounds. The identification of these compounds was carried out by GC-MS and NMR. All the identified nitrogen-containing compounds are reported here for the first time in ambrette seeds. Among these are 27 pyrazine derivatives and 12 pyridines, including the tentative identification of four new natural compounds, 1-(6-ethyl-3-hydroxypyridin-2-yl)ethanone (1), 1-(3-hydroxy-5,6-dimethylpyridin-2-yl)ethanone (2), 1-(3-hydroxy-6-methylpyridin-2-yl)ethanone (3), and 1-(3-hydroxy-5-methylpyridin-2-yl)ethanone (4). The odor of the basic fraction was assumed to be due to these pyrazines and pyridines and also the presence of seven thiazoles. The odors described suggest that these N-compounds contribute to what is described in perfumery terms as the "natural and rounded" character of the ambrette extract.	abelmoschus moschatus thiazoles
1	Foliar and cortex oleoresin variability of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) in Albania.Terpene composition of needle and cortical oleoresin from lateral shoots were analyzed by GC/MS for four Silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) populations scattered in natural species range in Albania. More than sixty compounds were detected in the needle oleoresin, which was characterized by a high content of alpha-pinene, camphene, beta-pinene, limonene and bornyl acetate. Three monoterpenes, alpha-pinene, beta-pinene and limonene, and two sesquiterpenes, beta-caryophyllene and germacrene D, comprised the majority of cortical oleoresin. The terpene composition differences among the populations that led to the recognition of two chemotypes. The needle oleoresin from the provinces of Puka, Bulqiza and Llogara were characterised by high amounts of beta-pinene, camphene and alpha-pinene and low amounts of limonene, while that from Drenova had high amounts of beta-pinene and limonene. A similar pattern was found in the cortical oleoresin with the exception of camphene that was a minor contributor. Geographical and seasonal variation between the populations was, also, investigated. Multivariate analysis of both needle and cortical oleoresin separated Drenova (southeastern population) from the other sites. When both major monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes were considered four chemical profiles could be attributed. Based on their chemical profiles, the populations can be divided into two groups: Populations with high content of beta-pinene and alpha-pinene but a low content of limonene (Puka, Bulqiza and Llogara), typical of most of A. alba populations in all its distribution range. Population with a high content of limonene and a moderate content of beta-pinene and alpha-pinene (Drenova).	a. alba alpha-pinene
2	Cassia cinnamon for the attenuation of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance resulting from sleep loss.Epidemiological investigations reveal a concomitant increase in sleep loss and metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, over the past several decades. An increasing body of scientific evidence indicates that acute sleep loss induces insulin resistance and glucose intolerance profiles similar to those of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. Experimentally, cassia cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia) supplementation facilitates glucose disposal in healthy humans, which may be achieved by enhancing (1) insulin sensitivity via increased phosphorylation of signaling proteins and (2) insulin-sensitive glucose transporter 4-mediated glucose uptake into muscle cells. Because peripheral insulin resistance is primarily a consequence of reduced muscle insulin sensitivity, C. cassia and C. cassia extracts may attenuate insulin resistance and glucose intolerance observed following sleep loss.	cinnamon diabetes mellitus
2	In vitro anti-Helicobacter pylori action of 30 Chinese herbal medicines used to treat ulcer diseases.Infection by Helicobacter pylori has been ascertained to be an important etiologic impetus leading usually to chronic active gastritis and gastric ulcer with growing incidences worldwide. Utilizing as the test pathogen a standard and five clinic strains of Helicobacter pylori, the antibacterial action was assessed in vitro with ethanol extracts of 30 Chinese herbal medicines which have been frequently prescribed since ancient times for treating gastritis-like disorders. Among the 30 tested materials, the ethanol extracts of Abrus cantoniensis (Fabaceae), Saussurea lappa (Asteraceae) and Eugenia caryophyllata (Myrtaceae) were strongly inhibitory to all test strains (MICs: approximately 40 microg/ml), and Hippophae rhamnoides (Elaeagnaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii (Liliaceae), Magnolia officinalis and Schisandra chinensis (Magnoliaceae), Corydalis yanhusuo (Papaveraceae), Citrus reticulata (Rutaceae), Bupleurum chinense and Ligusticum chuanxiong (Apiaceae) substantially active with MICs close to 60.0 microg/ml. As to antibacterial actions of the aqueous extracts of the same drugs, those derived from Cassia obtusifolia (Fabaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii and Eugenia caryophyllata were remarkably inhibitory against all the six Helicobacter pylori strains (MICs: approximately 60 microg/ml). The work compared almost quantitatively the magnitude of the anti-Helicobacter pylori actions of the 30 most prescribed gastritis-treating Chinese herbal drugs, and located as well some source plants where potent anti-Helicobacter pylori phytochemicals could be characterized.	saussurea lappa ulcer diseases
1	UHPLC-TOFMS coupled with chemometric method as a powerful technique for rapid exploring of differentiating components between two Ziziphus species.To rapidly explore the differentiating components and the potential chemical markers for discrimination between those Chinese medicinal herbs with similar chemical characteristics, an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-TOFMS coupled with multivariate statistical analysis method was proposed and validated by using two Ziziphus species (Z. jujuba and Z. jujuba var. spinosa) as the model herbs. After the samples were analyzed using UHPLC-TOFMS, the data sets of retention time (RT)-m/z pairs, ion intensities and sample codes were further processed with orthogonal partial least squared discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) to holistically compare the difference between the fruits of these two Ziziphus species, and to generate an S-plot. Those compounds correlating to the points at the two ends of "S" were regarded as the most differentiating components between these two kinds of samples. By comparing the mass/UV spectra and retention times with those of reference compounds, these components were finally characterized as zizyberenalic acid, palmitoleic acid, oleic acid, pomonic acid and rutin, and these compounds would be the potential chemical markers for discrimination of these jujube products. The results suggested that this newly established approach could be used to rapidly determine the subtle differences and explore the potential chemical markers for differentiation within the herbs with similar chemical ingredients.	jujube zizyberenalic acid
1	In vitro efficacy of 75 essential oils against Aspergillus niger.Aspergillus niger is an opportunistic human pathogen and a strong air pollutant. A study was conducted with 75 different essential oils for the inhibition of hyphal growth and spore formation in Aspergillus niger. Cinnamomum zeylanicum (bark), Cinnamomum zeylanicum (leaf), Cinnamomum cassia, Syzygium aromaticum and Cymbopogon citratus were the top five essential oils which demonstrated marked inhibitory effect against hyphal growth and spore formation of A. niger. The chemical composition of these five most active essential oils was investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectra (GC-MS). Most of the other essential oils were found challenging to combat A. niger, suggesting their use as strong aroma therapeutic agents.	a. niger essential oils
0	Nitidine chloride prevents OVX-induced bone loss via suppressing NFATc1-mediated osteoclast differentiation.Nitidine chloride (NC), a bioactive alkaloid isolated from Zanthoxylum nitidum, has been used as a herbal ingredient in toothpaste that prevents cavities for decades. It also displays potential antitumor and anti-inflammation properties. However, its anticatabolic effect on bone is not known. We investigated the effect of NC on osteoclastogenesis, bone resorption and RANKL-induced NF-kappaB and NFATc1 signalling. In mouse-derived bone marrow monocytes (BMMs), NC suppressed RANKL-induced multinucleated tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive osteoclast formation and bone resorption in a dose dependent manner. NC attenuated the expression of osteoclast marker genes including cathepsin K, D2, calcitonin receptor, NFATc1, and TRAP. Further, NC inhibited RANKL-activated NF-kappaB and NFATc1 signalling pathways. In vivo study revealed that NC abrogated oestrogen deficiency-induced bone loss in ovariectomized mice. Histological analysis showed that the number of osteoclasts was significantly lower in NC-treated groups. Collectively, our data demonstrate that NC suppressed osteoclastogenesis and prevented OVX-induced bone loss by inhibiting RANKL-induced NF-kappaB and NFATc1 signalling pathways. NC may be a natural and novel treatment for osteoclast-related bone lytic diseases.	NC NFATc1
2	Inbreeding depression influences genet size distribution in a marine angiosperm.Although inbreeding depression is a major genetic phenomena influencing individual fitness, it is difficult to measure in wild populations. An alternative approach is to correlate heterozygosity, measured using highly polymorphic markers, with a fitness-correlated trait. In clonal plants, genet size is predicted to be fitness correlated. Here we test the prediction that the genet size distribution of the marine clonal plant Zostera marina (eelgrass) is influenced by inbreeding depression. We used nine polymorphic microsatellite markers to access the fine scale clonal structure and to measure individual heterozygosity within 4 plots (each corresponds to 256 m2, sampled at 1-m intervals) in two populations along the German Baltic Coast. The same plots were also sampled for flowering and vegetative shoots to obtain estimates for sexual reproductive output at the level of the genetic individual. We found substantial differences in the genet size distribution between the two populations that may be explained by different disturbance frequency. In both populations, clone size was significantly positively correlated with the total number of flowering shoots, indicating that larger clones have a higher reproductive output. Individual heterozygosity was significantly positively associated with clone size. The effect was much stronger in Falkenstein (low disturbance) than in Maasholm (high disturbance). The results indicate that in a low disturbance population the relatively outbred clones occupy a higher proportion of the available space, possibly because they outcompete relatively inbred neighbours.	zostera marina depression
1	Synergistic antioxidant activity of green tea with some herbs.Cardiovascular diseases, cancer, arthritis, etc. are caused by free radicals that are byproducts of metabolic pathways. Selected plants namely Vitis vinifera, Phyllanthus emblica L., Punica granatum, Cinnamomum cassia, Ginkgo biloba L., and Camellia sinensis Linn. are reported to produce antioxidant property. This study is undertaken to support the hypothesis that formulation of a polyherbal combination of these plants shows a synergistic effect with green tea. The extracts of each drug were characterized by phytochemical studies and tests for phenolics and flavonoids. In vitro antioxidant activity for individual drug and its combination was determined by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), superoxide, and nitric oxide free radical scavenging methods. Our results suggest that a combination of all these herbs with green tea can synergistically enhance antioxidant activity and thus lower doses of each herb with green tea may be used. Antioxidant potential of polyherbal combination was also comparable to that of standard ascorbic acid. Studies showed that selected individual plants contained abundant quantity of phenolics and flavonoids and their polyherbal combination with green tea was found to produce best antioxidant activity among all individual extracts. This will help in avoiding undesirable side effects due to higher doses of single herb.	ginkgo biloba l flavonoids
2	Phytochemical profiles and biological activity evaluation of Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim seed against asthma in murine models.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim seed (ZBMS) has been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) as an ingredient of polyherbal formulations for the treatment of inflammation and asthma. The aim of this study was to analyze the major composition and to evaluate the anti-asthma activity of ZBMS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Some murine models including acetylcholine/histamine-induced asthma, ovalbumin-induced airway inflammation, ear edema and toe swelling measurement, citric acid-induced cough, and anti-stress abilities were investigated to fully study the anti-asthma activity of ZBMS.GC chromatography was also performed to analyze the major fatty acid composition of ZBMS. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that the major fatty acid composition of ZBMS includes oleic acid (20.15%), linoleic acid (26.54%), and alpha-linolenic acid (30.57%), which was the leading component of ZBMS, and that the total fatty acid content of ZBMS was 77.27%. The murine models demonstrated that ZBMS displays a protective effect on guinea pig sensitization, a dose-dependent inhibition of the increases in RL and decreases in Cdyn, which resulted in the relief of auricle edema and toe swelling in mice and anti-stress activity. CONCLUSION: Our results validate the traditional use of ZBMS for the treatment of asthma and other inflammatory joint disorders, and suggest that ZBMS has potential as a new therapeutic agent for asthma management.	zanthoxylum bungeanum maxim toe swelling
3	Hypnotic effect of jujubosides from Semen Ziziphi Spinosae.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Semen Ziziphi Spinosae, the seed of Ziziphus jujuba Mill. var. spinosa (bunge) Hu ex H.F. Chow has been widely used in treating insomnia and anxiety. AIM OF THE STUDY: In this study, we investigated the hypnotic effect of jujubosides, one of the major components (saponin) of Semen Ziziphi Spinosae, in both day and night period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After the administration of jujubosides (9 mg/kg once per day for 3 days), sleep parameters were examined by EEG and EMG analysis in normal rats and the action of jujubosides on pentobarbital-induced sleep assessed by the loss-of righting reflex. RESULTS: During daytime (9:00-15:00), jujubosides significantly increased the total sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep without significant influence on non-REM (NREM) sleep. During nighttime (21:00-3:00), jujubosides significantly increased the total sleep and NREM sleep especially the light sleep while showed no significant effect on REM sleep and slow wave sleep (SWS). In pentobarbital-treated mice, jujubosides significantly augmented the hypnotic effect of pentobarbital (45 mg/kg, i.p.), proved by increasing sleep time and this augmentative effect was potentiated by 5-hydroxytryptophan (2mg/kg, i.p.). Furthermore, jujubosides inhibited the para-chlorophenylalanine-induced suppression of pentobarbital-induced hypnosis. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that the hypnotic effect of jujubosides on normal rats may be influenced by circadian rhythm and the serotonergic system may involve in the hypnotic effect of jujubosides. Jujubosides may be good source of lead compounds for novel hypnotics.	jujubosides insomnia
1	New fatty acid esters originate during storage by the interaction of components in prasaplai, a Thai traditional medicine.Prasaplai is a Thai traditional preparation composed of twelve ingredients; during storage three newly emerging compounds were detected by HPLC. Their structures were established as the new (E)-4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-en-1-yl linoleate, (E)-4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-en-1-yl oleate and the known (E)-4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-en-1-yl palmitate on the basis of spectral data and chemical evidence. The artificial esters were already observable after one day of storage of the freshly prepared dry mixture, and steadily increased during a storage period of 30 days and more. A systematic search indicated that the three esters arose from the interaction of compounds contained in the rhizomes of Zingiber cassumunar and the seeds of Nigella sativa.	zingiber cassumunar (e)-4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-en-1-yl palmitate
1	Cytotoxic mannopyranosides of indole alkaloids from Zanthoxylum nitidum.Three new mannopyranosides of indole alkaloids, methyl 7-(beta-D-mannopyranosyloxy)-1H-indole-2-carboxylate (1), methyl 7-[(3-O-acetyl-beta-D-mannopyranosyl)oxy]-1H-indole-2-carboxylate (2), and 2-methyl-1H-indol-7-yl beta-D-mannopyranoside (3), were isolated from an EtOH extract of the roots of Zanthoxylum nitidum. Their structures were identified as new compounds on the basis of the spectroscopic analyses. Bioactivity evaluation revealed that these alkaloids possess significant cytotoxicities against all the tested tumor cell lines with IC50 values of less than 30 muM. 	zanthoxylum nitidum alkaloids
3	New indolopyridoquinazoline, benzo[c]phenanthridines and cytotoxic constituents from Zanthoxylum integrifoliolum.Three new alkaloids, 7,8-dehydro-1-methoxyrutaecarpine, isodecarine, and 8-demethyloxychelerythrine, together with sixteen known compounds, norchelerythrine, oxychelerythrine, decarine, dihydrocherythrinylacetaldehyde, 6-acetonyldihydrochelerythrine, rutaecarpine, 1-hydroxyrutaecarpine, gamma-fagarine, skimmianine, (-)-matairesinol, (-)-isoarctigenin, (+)-epipinoresinol, d-sesamin, lupeol, canthin-6-one, and arnottianamide have been isolated from the root bark of Zanthoxylum integrifoliolum. The structures of these new compounds were determined through spectral analyses. Among the isolates, 7,8-dehydro-1-methoxyrutaecarpine, norchelerythrine, oxychelerythrine, dihydrocherythrinylacetaldehyde, 6-acetonyldihydrochelerythrine, 1-hydroxyrutaecarpine, gamma-fagarine, skimmianine, (-)-matairesinol, and canthin-6-one exhibited cytotoxicities (ED50 values &lt; 4 microg/mL) against P-388 or HT-29 cell lines in vitro.	indolopyridoquinazoline cytotoxicities
3	Inhibitory effect of ailanthoidol on 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate-induced tumor promotion in mouse skin.Many components derived from dietary or medicinal plants showing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential have been found to possess chemopreventive properties. In our previous study, we achieved the total synthesis of ailanthoidol (AT), a neolignan from Zanthoxylum ailanthoides or Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, which are used in Chinese traditional herbal medicine. In the present study, preliminarily, AT exhibited a radical quenching property by DPPH assay. Following this, we assessed the effect of AT on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced oxidative stress and inflammation in female CD-1 mouse skin which was closely linked to tumor promotion. The topical application of AT (0.5-2.5 mM; 200 microl) reduced the formation of hydrogen peroxide and inhibited the myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in the mouse skin when compared with that of the TPA-treated alone group. In addition, AT presented a suppression effect on the TPA-induced hyperplasia and leukocyte infiltration in the epidermis and edema of mouse ears. Furthermore, it showed that AT inhibited the TPA-induced expression of COX-2 protein and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity in epidermis. Finally, AT was evaluated for its ability to inhibit the TPA-induced promotion in skin tumors of female CD-1 mice. Topical application of AT 5 min prior to TPA (5 nmol) three times weekly for 12 weeks to mice which were initiated with benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) inhibited the incidence of skin tumors in mice and the average number of tumors per mice as compared to TPA-treated alone. These results indicate that AT possesses potential as a chemopreventive agent against tumor promotion.	AT tumor
1	Anticonvulsant, antidepressant-like activity of Abelmoschus manihot ethanol extract and its potential active components in vivo.Depression is the most common psychiatric comorbidity in patients with epilepsy. Searching for antiepileptic (anticonvulsant) and antidepressant-like medicines from natural products is very important for the treatment of this disease. The flower of Abelmoschus manihot (Linn.) Medicus has been reported to have neuroprotective effect against cerebral ischemia injury. In order to further explore the activity of Abelmoschus manihot on the central nervous system, the anticonvulsant and antidepressant-like effects of Abelmoschus manihot ethanol extract (AMEE) as well as its potential active components in vivo was investigated in the present study. It was found that AMEE could protect mice against PTZ-induced clonic convulsions and mortality. AMEE could also decrease immobility time in the FST in mice. Furthermore, the potential active components of AMEE in rat brain were identified by ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometer (UPLC-MS). Five parent components including isoquercitrin, hyperoside, hibifolin, quercetin-3'-O-glucoside, quercetin and three metabolites were detected in rat brain after administration of AMEE. In conclusion, eight flavonoids were identified in rat brain after administration of AMEE; meanwhile, these flavonoids might represent the potential bioactive components of AMEE and contribute to its anticonvulsant and antidepressant-like activity in vivo.	abelmoschus manihot quercetin
1	Antiproliferation of melanoma cells by polysaccharide isolated from Zizyphus jujuba.OBJECTIVE: Zizyphus jujuba, a traditional Chinese herb rich in functional components such as polysaccharide, has been widely consumed in Asian countries. The objective of this study was to determine the antiproliferation effect of melanoma cells as affected by deproteinized polysaccharide (DPP) isolated from Z. jujuba. METHODS: Deproteinized polysaccharide was obtained through boiling water extraction, ethanol precipitation, deproteinization, and dialysis, and the molecular weight of DPP was determined by high-performance gel-filtration chromatography. Melanoma cell viability was assessed by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, the cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry, the formation of apoptotic bodies was observed under a fluorescence microscope at 450 nm, and caspase-3 and caspase-9 were measured by an assay kit. RESULTS: Deproteinized polysaccharide was composed of two fractions with average molecular weights of 143 108 and 67 633 Da. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide test showed that the antiproliferation effect of DPP on melanoma cells followed a dose- and time-dependent course. The 50% inhibitory concentration of DPP in inhibiting melanoma cell growth was 3.99 +- 0.10 mg/mL after 24-h treatment but decreased significantly to 3.36 +- 0.14 mg/mL after 48 h. The cell cycle assay revealed melanoma cells to be arrested in G2/M phase. Moreover, with DPP treatment, the apoptotic bodies were generated, accompanied by an increase in caspase-3 and caspase-9 activity. CONCLUSIONS: This outcome suggested that DPP may be used as a potential anti-skin cancer agent for further in vivo and clinical trial experiments.	z. jujuba polysaccharide
2	Zanthoxylum piperitum DC ethanol extract suppresses fat accumulation in adipocytes and high fat diet-induced obese mice by regulating adipogenesis.This study was conducted to determine the anti-obesity effects of Zanthoxylum piperitum DC fruit ethanol extract (ZPE) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and obese mice fed a high-fat diet. We evaluated the influence of the addition of ZPE to a high-fat diet on body weight, adipose tissue weight, serum and hepatic lipids in C57BL/6 mice. In addition, adipogenic gene expression was determined by Western blot and real-time reverse transcription-PCR analysis. We assessed the effect of ZPE on 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation. ZPE reduced weight gain, white adipose tissue mass, and serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels (p&lt;0.05) in high-fat diet-fed C57BL/6 mice. ZPE decreased lipid accumulation and PPARgamma, C/EBPalpha, SREBP-1, and FAS protein and mRNA levels in the liver. ZPE inhibited in vitro adipocyte differentiation in a dose-dependent manner and significantly attenuated adipogenic transcription factors, such as PPARgamma, C/EBPalpha, and SREBP-1 in 3T3L1 cells. These findings suggest that Z. piperitum DC exerts an anti-obesity effect by inhibiting adipogenesis through the downregulation of genes involved in the adipogenesis pathway.	z. piperitum obesity
2	Pharmacognostic specification of Zanthoxylum limonella (Dennst.) Alston: Fruits and seeds in Thailand.Zanthoxylum limonella (Dennst.) Alston. (Rutaceae) or Ma-khwaen is one of the medicinal plants in Thai traditional medicine. To investigate the pharmacognostic specifications and chemical constituents of Z. limonella fruits and seeds. Fruits and seeds of Z. limonella were collected from 15 sources throughout Thailand; then examined the pharmacognostic specification following WHO guideline of quality control method for medicinal plant materials. Microscopic determination of Z. limonella powders demonstrated fragment of mesocarp, fragment of brown vitta, oil glands, fragment of endocarp, and endosperm containing oil globule, trichome and pale brown stone cells. Stomatal index and pellucid dots in mm2 were 19.87 and 4.2 respectively. Physico-chemical parameters unveiled that loss on drying, water content, total ash, and acid-insoluble ash should be not &gt;17.90%, 9.18%, 4.50%, and 0.60% of dried weight respectively; while ethanol, water, and hexane extractive values and volatile oil content should be not &lt;2.24%, 2.27%, 1.57% and 9.63% of dried weight respectively. Rf values of thin-layer chromatographic fingerprint of Z. limonella fruits and seeds ethanolic extract were 0.38, 0.45, 0.90, and 0.97 detected ultraviolet (UV) light 254 nm, 0.30, 0.44, 0.67, and 0.77 detected UV light 366 nm, and 0.24, 0.73, 0.78, and 0.93 detected 10% sulfuric acid. There are three main chemical compounds in Z. limonella oil including limonene (43.63%), (+)-sabinene (16.72%), and terpinen-4-ol (10.95%). The result gained from pharmacognostic specifications and chemical fingerprints could be used as standardization data of Z. limonella fruits and seeds to apply or provide for guarantee of quality.	z. limonella (+)-sabinene
1	Mediation of beta-endorphin by myricetin to lower plasma glucose in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.Streptozotocin-induced diabetic (STZ-diabetic) rats were employed to investigate the mechanism(s) whereby myricetin, the active principle of Abelmoschus moschatus (Malvaceae), exerts its glucose-lowering effects. Myricetin was purified from the aerial portion of the plant and administered intravenously. A dose-dependent decrease in plasma glucose concentration was observed 30 min following injection, in parallel with increased plasma beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity (BER). Myricetin enhanced BER release similarly from isolated adrenal medulla. Plasma glucose-lowering and BER-elevating effects of myricetin were both eliminated after bilateral adrenalectomy. Myricetin failed to lower plasma glucose after treatment with opioid mu-receptor antagonists and in opioid mu-receptor knockout diabetic mice. Injection of myricetin three times daily for three consecutive days resulted in increased expression of the glucose transporter subtype 4 (GLUT 4) in soleus muscle and in reduced expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) in liver; these inductions were preventable by opioid mu-receptor blockade. Findings support the conclusion that the plasma glucose-lowering action of myricetin in insulin-deficient animals is mediated by activation of opioid mu-receptors of peripheral tissues in response to increased beta-endorphin secretion. Opioid mu-receptor activation is held responsible for the enhancement of muscle GLUT 4 gene expression and the attenuation of hepatic PEPCK gene expression observed in these myricetin-treated diabetic animals.	abelmoschus moschatus myricetin
1	SPE-HPLC method for the determination of four flavonols in rat plasma and urine after oral administration of Abelmoschus manihot extract.A SPE-HPLC method was developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of flavonols, isoquercitrin (1), hibifolin (2), myricetin (3), quercetin-3'-O-d-glucoside (4) and quercetin (5) in rat plasma and urine after oral administration of the total flavonoids from Abelmoschus manihot (TFA). The astragalin (6) and kaempferol (7) were used as internal standards (IS). Plasma and urine samples were pretreated by solid-phase extraction using Winchem C(18) reversed-phase cartridges. Analysis of the plasma and urinary extract was performed on YMC-Pack ODS-A C(18) and Thermo ODS-2HYEPRSIL C(18) reversed-phase column, respectively and a mobile phase of acetonitrile-0.1% phosphoric acid was employed. HPLC analysis was conducted with different elution gradients. The flow rate was 1.0 mL/min and the detection wavelength was set at 370 nm. Calibration ranges in plasma for flavonols 2-5 were at 0.011-2.220, 0.014-2.856, 0.022-4.320, and 0.028-5.600 microg/mL, respectively. In urine calibration ranges for flavonols 1, 2, 4 and 5 were at 2.00-16.00, 8.56-102.72, 2.70-21.60, and 3.00-24.00 microg/mL, respectively. The RSD of intra- and inter-day was less than 5.40% and 4.89% in plasma, and less than 3.96% and 6.85% in urine for all the analyses. A preliminary experiment to investigate the plasma concentration and urinary excretion of the flavonols after oral administration of TFA to rats demonstrated that the present method was suitable for determining the flavonols in rat plasma and urine.	abelmoschus manihot isoquercitrin
1	Insecticidal and fumigant activities of Cinnamomum cassia bark-derived materials against Mechoris ursulus (Coleoptera: attelabidae).The insecticidal and fumigant activities of Cinnamomum cassia (Blume) bark-derived materials against the oak nut weevil (Mechoris ursulus Roelofs) were examined using filter paper diffusion and fumigation methods and compared to those of the commercially available Cinnamomum bark-derived compounds (eugenol, salicylaldehyde, trans-cinnamic acid, and cinnamyl alcohol). The biologically active constituent of the Cinnamomum bark was characterized as trans-cinnamaldehyde by spectroscopic analysis. In a test with the filter paper diffusion method, trans-cinnamaldehyde showed 100 and 83.3% mortality at rates of 2.5 and 1.0 mg/filter paper, respectively. At 2.5 mg/paper, strong insecticidal activity was produced from eugenol (90.0% mortality) and salicylaldehyde (88. 9%), whereas trans-cinnamic acid revealed moderate activity (73.3%). At 5 mg/paper, weak insecticidal activity (50.0%) was produced from cinnamyl alcohol. In a fumigation test, the Cinnamomum bark-derived compounds were much more effective against M. ursulus larvae in closed cups than in open ones. These results indicate that the insecticidal activity of test compounds was attributable to fumigant action, although there is also significant contact toxicity. As a naturally occurring insect-control agent, the Cinnamomum bark-derived materials described could be useful as a new preventive agent against damage caused by M. ursulus.

3	Divalent later transition metal complexes of the traditional chinese medicine (TCM) liriodenine: coordination chemistry, cytotoxicity and DNA binding studies.Liriodenine (L), a natural alkaloid, was isolated as an active component from the anticancer traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Zanthoxylum nitidum. It reacted with Mn(II), Fe(II), Co(II) and Zn(II) to afford four metal complexes: [MnCl(2)(L)(2)] (1), [FeCl(2)(L)(2)] (2), [Co(L)(2)(H(2)O)(2).Co(L)(2)(CH(3)CH(2)OH)(2)](ClO(4))(4) (3), and [Zn(2)(L)(2)(mu(2)-Cl)(2)Cl(2)] (4), which were characterized by elemental analysis, IR, ESI-MS. Their crystal structures were determined by the single crystal X-ray diffraction method. The in vitro cytotoxicity of L and complexes 1-4 against 10 human tumour cell lines was assayed. Some of these metal-based compounds exhibited enhanced cytotoxicity vs. free L to selected tumour cell lines. The binding properties of L and its complexes 1-4 to ct-DNA were investigated by spectroscopic methods and viscosity measurements. Agarose gel electrophoresis experiments were also carried out to evaluate their unwinding ability towards plasmid DNA and their inhibition towards Topoisomerase I. All the results indicate that complexes 1-4 may bind more intensively to the DNA helix than does L, and intercalative binding for complexes 1-4 and electrostatic interactions for complexes 3-4 to DNA should be considered. For complex 4, covalent binding to DNA may exist. Of special note, all these metal complexes effectively inhibit Topoisomerase I even at low concentration (&lt; or = 10 microM).	Liriodenine tumour
1	Roles of microtubules and cellulose microfibril assembly in the localization of secondary-cell-wall deposition in developing tracheary elements.The roles of cellulose microfibrils and cortical microtubules in establishing and maintaining the pattern of secondary-cell-wall deposition in tracheary elements were investigated with direct dyes to inhibit cellulose microfibril assembly and amiprophosmethyl to inhibit microtubule polymerization. When direct dyes were added to xylogenic cultures of Zinnia elegans L. mesophyll cells just before the onset of differentiation, the secondary cell wall was initially secreted as bands composed of discrete masses of stained material, consistent with immobilized sites of cellulose synthesis. The masses coalesced, forming truncated, sinuous or smeared thickenings, as secondary cell wall deposition continued. The absence of ordered cellulose microfibrils was confirmed by polarization microscopy and a lack of fluorescence dichroism as determined by laser scanning microscopy. Indirect immunofluorescence showed that cortical microtubules initially subtended the masses of dye-altered secondary cell wall material but soon became disorganized and disappeared. Although most of the secondary cell wall was deposited in the absence of subtending cortical microtubules in dye-treated cells, secretion remained confined to discrete regions of the plasma membrane. Examination of non-dye-treated cultures following application of microtubule inhibitors during various stages of secondary-cell-wall deposition revealed that the pattern became fixed at an early stage such that deposition remained localized in the absence of cortical microtubules. These observations indicate that cortical microtubules are required to establish, but not to maintain, patterned secondary-cell-wall deposition. Furthermore, cellulose microfibrils play a role in maintaining microtubule arrays and the integrity of the secondary-cell-wall bands during deposition.	zinnia elegans cellulose
1	Aroma constituents and alkylamides of red and green huajiao (Zanthoxylum bungeanum and Zanthoxylum schinifolium).Huajiao denotes the fruits of various species of Zanthoxylum in the plant family Rutaceare used for cooking. The two most commercially popular species are bungeanum (red huajiao) and schinifolium (green huajiao). Fresh huajiao has a very high content of essential oil, up to 11%, which is described as having fresh, spicy, floral, cooling, and green aroma notes. A comprehensive analysis of the essential oils by GC-MS using advanced peak deconvolution and data processing software, revealed many overlapping components. A total of 120 aroma compounds for each species has been found. In the essential oils, linalyl acetate (15%), linalool (13%), and limonene (12%) are the major components of red huajiao, whereas linalool (29%), limonene (14%), and sabinene (13%) are the major components of green huajiao. For estimation of the aroma contribution of individual components, a new concept, "aroma character impact value" (ACI), is introduced as the percentage of the ratio of the concentration of an aroma component to its odor threshold value. Despite the differences in major components, both species have six common compounds of top aroma character impact: linalool, alpha-terpineol, myrcene, 1,8-cineole, limonene, and geraniol. The tingling sensation of huajiao is caused mainly by the alkylamide hydroxy-alpha-sanshool. The tingling compound decomposes easily under hydrolytic conditions or under UV light.

1	Combined analysis by GC (RI), GC-MS and 13C NMR of the supercritical fluid extract of Abies alba twigs.Two samples (leaves and twigs) of Abies alba Miller from Corsica were extracted using supercritical CO2 and their chemical compositions were compared with those of the essential oils obtained from the same batch of plant material. In total 45 components were identified using combined analysis by GC (RI), GC-MS and 13C NMR. It was observed that the contents of monoterpenes (mainly represented by limonene, alpha-pinene and camphene) were significantly lower in the supercritical fluid extract (SFE) than in the essential oil (EO). Conversely, the proportions of sesquiterpenes were much higher in CO2 extracts than in essential oils (around 30% vs 4%). Cis-abienol, a diterpene alcohol, was identified only in SFE, and the proportions of this constituent (7.5% and 17.3%) were determined using quantitative 13C NMR since it was under estimated using the standard conditions of GC.	abies alba alpha-pinene
1	[Studies on the chemical constituents from the peel of Zanthoxylum schinifolium Sieb et Zucc].Five compounds have been isolated from the Chinese traditional drug Qinghuajiao (Zanthoxylum schinifolium Sieb et Zucc). On the basis of UV, IR, 1HNMR, 13CNMR, 1H-1H COSY, 1H-13C COSY, NOESY and MS spectroscopic analysis, four of them have been identified as bergarpten (I), umbelliferone (II), skimmianine (III) and schinifoline (IV) respectively. The compounds II, III and IV were obtained for the first time from Zanthoxylum schinifolium, and the last one is a new compound.	zanthoxylum schinifolium bergarpten
1	Quantitative and structural analysis of amides and lignans in Zanthoxylum armatum by UPLC-DAD-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS.A rapid and simple ultra performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection (UPLC-DAD) method has been developed for the simultaneous quantification of four biologically important furofuran lignans, asarinin, sesamin, fargesin and kobusin, and an amide, armatamide in Zanthoxylum armatum within 7min. The separation was carried out on a BEH C18 column (2.1mmx100mm, 1.7mum particle size) with 0.05% formic acid aqueous solution and acetonitrile as mobile phase under gradient conditions at 25 C. The method was validated and found to be linear (R(2)&gt;=0.9997), precise in terms of peak areas (intra-day RSDs&lt;=0.62% and inter-day RSDs&lt;=2.95%) and accurate (95.6-104.0%). The developed method was applied to the quality assessment of different parts (leaves, bark and seeds) of Z. armatum including locational variation of leaves samples. Significant variation in the amount of amides and furofuran lignans was observed. Tandem electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (UPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS) of samples led to the identification of sixteen compounds in the category of amides and furofuran lignans. 	z. armatum fargesin
4	Inhibitory effect of Abrus abrin-derived peptide fraction against Dalton's lymphoma ascites model.Peptides derived from larger molecules that are important modulators in cancer regression are becoming leads for development of therapeutic drugs. It has been reported that Abrus abrin, isolated from the seeds of Abrus precatorius, showed in vitro and in vivo antitumor properties by the induction of apoptosis. The present study was designed to evaluate the in vivo therapeutic effectiveness of abrin-derived peptide (ABP) fraction in Dalton's lymphoma (DL) mice model. The lethal dose (LD(50)) of ABP was found to be 2.25 mg/kg body weight and further the acute toxicity was determined with sublethal doses in normal mice. The acute toxicity like body weight, peripheral blood cell count, lympho-hematological and biochemical parameters remained unaffected till 200 microg/kg body weight of ABP. The sublethal doses of ABP showed very significant growth inhibitory properties in vivo DL mice model. There were 24%, 70.8% and 89.7% reductions in DL cell survival in 25, 50 and 100 microg/kg body weight of ABP, respectively. Analysis of the growth inhibitory mechanism in DL cells revealed nuclear fragmentation, and condensation with the appearance of the sub-G(0)/G(1) peak is indicative of apoptosis. Further, the Western blotting showed that apoptosis was mediated by the reduction in the ratio of Bcl-2 and Bax protein expression, and activation of caspase-3 through the release of cytochrome c in DL cells. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed an effective antitumor response (104.6 increase in life span (ILS) %) with a dose of 100 microg/kg body weight.	Bcl-2 cancer
1	Pharmacognostical and phytochemical evaluation of the leaves of Ziziphus xylopyrus (Retz) Willd.BACKGROUND: The fruit decoction of Ziziphus xylopyrus (Retz) Willd. is used toward increase sterility in woman intended birth control in some parts of Rajasthan, India. This plant is widely used in Turkish medicines as a potent sedative. One to two inches of the fresh stem bark of this species are chewed with 1-2 peppers, and the sap swallowed once a day for 5 days in the treatment of cough. Standardization is one of the challenges in herbal medicine. It is essential to evaluate the herbal plants scientifically and proper documentation should be made to know their medicinal properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Leaf samples of Z. xylopyrus were studied as recommended by World Health Organization for morphological, microscopic, physicochemical, phytochemical, powder characteristics and other methods for standardization. RESULTS: Morphologically the leaves are obovate or orbicular in shape, pinnate venation having aromatic odour and pungent taste. Microscopically leaves showed the presence of ground tissue, vascular strand, xylem and phloem. The crystals are mostly rosette type. Microscopic examination of powder showed the presence of stomata, covering trichomes, sclerenchyma, collenchyma, epidermal cells and vascular strands. Phytochemical screening of the plant part with various solvents revealed the presence of alkaloids, carbohydrates, steroids and sterol, glycosides, saponins, flavonoids, phenolic compounds, triterpenoids in it. Physicochemical parameters such as ash value extractive values were also determined and results showed that water soluble extractive value to be higher than alcohol soluble extractive value. CONCLUSION: Results may be helpful for further confirmation of selected species and in future these characters may be compared with the new batch of the same plant materials.	ziziphus xylopyrus steroids
2	Immunomodulatory activity of the aqueous extract of seeds of Abrus precatorius Linn (Jequirity) in mice.BACKGROUND: Various compounds of plant origin have been widely investigated since ancient times for their possible immunomodulatory properties as well as for the treatment of a wide range of diseases. OBJECTIVE: To study the immunomodulatory functions of the aqueous extract of the seeds of Abrus precatorius commonly known as Indian liquorice (Fabaceae), a medicinal plant native to central India. METHODS: Swiss albino mice were intraperitoneally treated with three doses (0.75, 1.25 and 2.5 microg/kg b.w.) of extract for 7 days. Relative organ weight, delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) response, haemagglutination titre (HT) and Phagocytic index (PI) were studied in various groups of animals. RESULTS: The results showed no significant difference in relative organ weight of spleen, liver, thymus and kidney in various groups of animals. Treatment of rats with increasing concentrations of the extract decreased the footpad thickness indicating a dose related inhibitory effect of the extract on delayed type hypersensitivity. In the HT test, the plant extract showed a suppressive effect at all doses, and these changes were significant as the dose increased. Phagocytic index was also increased in a dose dependent manner. CONCLUSION: The reduction of antibody titre, delayed type hypersensitivity response and the increase in phagocytic index indicates that Abrus precatorius has an inhibitory effect on the immune functions in mice.	abrus precatorius hypersensitivity
1	Angoline: a selective IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway inhibitor isolated from Zanthoxylum nitidum.STAT3 signaling pathway is an important target for human cancer therapy. Thus, the identification of small-molecules that target STAT3 signaling will be of great interests in the development of anticancer agents. The aim of this study was to identify novel inhibitors of STAT3 pathway from the roots of Zanthoxylum nitidum (Roxb.) DC. The bioassay-guided fractionation of MeOH extract of Z. nitidum using a STAT3-responsive gene reporter assay led to the isolation of angoline (1) as a potent and selective inhibitor of the STAT3 signaling pathway (IC50=11.56 muM). Angoline inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation and its target gene expression and consequently induced growth inhibition of human cancer cells with constitutively activated STAT3 (IC50=3.14-4.72 muM). This work provided a novel lead for the development of anti-cancer agents targeting the STAT3 signaling pathway.	z. nitidum Angoline
2	Attempted suicide, by mail order: Abrus precatorius.OBJECTIVE: Abrus precatorius is cultivated in many subtropical areas. The seeds exist in a variety of colors such as black, orange, and most commonly, glossy red. A black band is found at the end of the seed. The plant contains multiple pods which typically contain three to five Abrus seeds. The seeds contain abrin, which inhibits ribosomal function, halting protein synthesis and leading to cellular death. A unique aspect of this case is the use of the internet to order a potentially lethal poison as well as transmission of a picture to identify the seed. CASE REPORT: A 20-year-old man presented to the emergency department complaining of vomiting and watery diarrhea for 6-8 h prior to arrival. He denied any medication use, recent illness, travel, or changes in his diet. Initial vital signs were normal. The patient was diagnosed with viral gastroenteritis. During his evaluation, the patient admitted to feeling suicidal. While awaiting psychiatry evaluation, the patient's father arrived with a box of small hard red seeds, which he believed that his son ingested in a suicide attempt. The seeds could not be identified by the staff. A picture of the seeds was transmitted by e-mail to the New York City Poison Control Center, allowing their identification as A. precatorius. The patient was reinterviewed and admitted to chewing and swallowing 10 seeds. Given the potential toxicity of abrin, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. He continued to have frequent episodes of emesis as well as diarrhea. He gradually improved over 2 days. He admitted to ordering a box of Abrus seeds online from Asia after reading on the Internet about their use in suicide. He was eventually discharged for outpatient follow-up with no permanent sequelae. CONCLUSION: Abrin has an estimated human fatal dose of 0.1-1 mug/kg. Most cases of Abrus seed ingestions are unintentional and occur in children. Ingesting the intact seeds typically results in no clinical findings, as they pass through the gastrointestinal tract due to their hard shell. Abrin released during chewing is poorly absorbed systemically from the gastrointestinal tract. This causes the vomiting and diarrhea with resultant hypovolemia and electrolyte disturbances, which can be severe and life threatening, particularly in areas with less advanced health care systems. Management is primarily supportive.	a. precatorius viral gastroenteritis
2	Hepatoprotective potential of ethanolic extract of Ziziphus oenoplia (L.) Mill roots against antitubercular drugs induced hepatotoxicity in experimental models.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the hepatoprotective potential of ethanolic (50%) extract of Ziziphus oenoplia (L.) Mill (Z. oenoplia) root against isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RIF) induced liver damage in animal models. METHODS: Five groups of six rats each were selected for the study. Ethanolic extract at a dose of 150 and 300 mg/kg as well as silymarin (100 mg/kg) were administered orally once daily for 21 d in INH + RIF treated groups. The serum levels of glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase (SALP), and bilirubin were estimated along with activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase, and hepatic melondialdehyde formation. Histopathological analysis was carried out to assess injury to the liver. RESULTS: The considerably elevated serum enzymatic activities of glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, glutamate pyruvate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin due to INH + RIF treatment were restored towards normal in a dose dependent manner after the treatment with ethanolic extract of Z. oenoplia roots. Meanwhile, the decreased activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione S-transferase and glutathione peroxidase were also restored towards normal dose dependently. In addition, ethanolic extract also significantly prevented the elevation of hepatic melondialdehyde formation in the liver of INH + RIF intoxicated rats in a dose dependent manner. The biochemical observations were supplemented with histopathological examination of rat liver sections. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study strongly indicate that ethanolic extract of Z. oenoplia has a potent hepatoprotective action against INH + RIF induced hepatic damage in rats.	z. oenoplia hepatic damage
2	Therapeutic potential of root and stem bark of wild medicinal plant Ziziphus mauritiana (Lamk.) against silica induced toxicity in Wistar albino rats.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ziziphus mauritiana (Lamk.) of the family Rhamnaceae is a traditional herbal medicinal plant commonly called as 'ber' (Indian jujube). It is traditionally used as food source and helps in treatment of various diseases like malaria, asthma, diarrhoea, typhoid, diabetes, skin diseases and acts as a pain killer. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to evaluate the ability of extracts of barks of root and stem of Ziziphus mauritiana (ZM) to cure silica induced toxicity in Wistar albino rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experiments carried out on the acute toxicity studies of silica and therapeutic potential of ZM extracts were based on OECD guidelines and from these results lethal dose (LD50) values were determined. Silica was administered by IP injection at 20 mg/kg b.w. for 10 days and roots and stem barks extracts of ZM were fed orally by gavage at 400 mg/kg b.w. for 21 days. Assessments of biochemical, haematological parameters as well as liver histological examination were performed in the study. RESULTS: After 21 days of oral feeding of extracts of root and stem of ZM, it was found to alter the liver histology. Significant decrease in enzymes such as ALT, AST, ALP, LDH and urea, creatinine and uric acid levels in serum were recorded. Treatment with extracts could help enzymatic activity of liver antioxidant enzymes to settle towards normal level and significant decrease in the lipid peroxidation along with increase in the value of GSH in liver, was also observed. In addition, extracts of ZM also helped to reduce the serum NO, IL-6 and TNF-alpha level. CONCLUSION: Results of this study has suggested that the extracts of root and stem bark of ZM can be used for therapeutic purpose to prevent silica induced toxicity. ZM extracts could be utilised as natural antioxidant and immunotherapeutic medicines to protect silica induced cell damage.	jujube malaria
1	Zizimauritic acids A-C, three novel nortriterpenes from Ziziphus mauritiana.Zizimauritic acids A-C (1-3), three novel nortriterpenes with a unique A-nor-E-seco spiro-lactone ceanothane-type triterpene skeleton, together with 3 known triterpenes ceanothenic acid (4), betulinic acid (5), and ceanothic acid (6), were isolated from the roots of Ziziphus mauritiana. Compounds 1-4 showed cytotoxicities with the IC(50) values ranging from 5.05 to 11.94 mug/ml, and compounds 1 and 3 showed an inhibitory effect on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus with the IC(50) values 2.17 and 12.79 mug/ml. A plausible biosynthetic pathway of compounds 1-3 was proposed.	ziziphus mauritiana triterpenes
2	Total Phenolics and Total Flavonoids Contents and Hypnotic Effect in Mice of Ziziphus mauritiana Lam. Seed Extract.The seeds of Ziziphus mauritiana Lam. have been traditionally used for treatment of various complications including insomnia and anxiety. They are popularly used as sedative and hypnotic drugs in China, Korea, Myanmar, Vietnam, and other Asian countries. However, no scientific proof on hypnotic activity of Z. mauritiana seeds (ZMS) was reported. In this study, the hypnotic activity of 50% ethanolic extract from ZMS was observed on the loss of righting reflex in mice using pentobarbital-induced sleep mice method. The contents of total phenolics and total flavonoids in the extract were also determined. The results showed that the 50% ethanolic extract from ZMS contained total phenolics 27.62 +- 1.43 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g extract and total flavonoids 0.74 +- 0.03 mg quercetin equivalent (QE)/g extract. Oral administration of the extract at the dose of 200 mg/kg significantly increased the sleeping time in mice intraperitoneally administered with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg body weight). These results supported the traditional use of ZMS for the treatment of insomnia. The seeds of Z. mauritiana should be further developed as an alternative sedative and/or hypnotic product. 	z. mauritiana anxiety
1	Control of Aspergillus flavus in maize with plant essential oils and their components.The effects of 11 plant essential oils for maize kernel protection against Aspergillus flavus were studied. Tests were conducted to determine optimal levels of dosages for maize protection, effects of combinations of essential oils, and residual effects and toxicity of essential oils to maize plants. Principal constituents of eight essential oils were tested for ability to protect maize kernels. Essential oils of Cinnamomum zeylanicum (cinnamon), Mentha piperita (peppermint), Ocimum basilicum (basil), Origanum vulgare (origanum), Teloxys ambrosioides (the flavoring herb epazote), Syzygium aromaticum (clove), and Thymus vulgaris (thyme) caused a total inhibition of fungal development on maize kernels. Thymol and o-methoxycinnamaldehyde significantly reduced maize grain contamination. The optimal dosage for protection of maize varied from 3 to 8%. Combinations of C. zeylanicum with the remaining oils gave efficient control. A residual effect of C. zeylanicum was detected after 4 weeks of kernel treatment. No phytotoxic effect on germination and corn growth was detected with any of these oils.	c. zeylanicum o-methoxycinnamaldehyde
2	Large-scale and effective screening of Korean medicinal plants for inhibitory activity on matrix metalloproteinase-9.Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) degrades type IV collagen constituting the major structural component of the basement membrane and extra cellular membrane. The enzymatic activity is found to be elevated in tumor tissues. With the aim of finding novel MMP-9 inhibitors from natural products, 87 extracts of oriental medicinal herbs, which are used as prescriptions for cancer treatment in traditional Korean medicine, were screened for their inhibitory activities towards MMP-9. It was found that most of the hexane and chloroform fractions as well as water extracts showed a weak inhibitory effect on MMP-9 activity at a concentration of 100mug/ml. However, a strong inhibition was found in the butanol fractions of Cinnamomum cassia PRESL, Magnolia obovata THUEB., Magnolia officinalis REHD. et WILS., Magnolia officinalis REHD. et WILS. var. biloba REHD. et WILS., and Euonymus alatus (THUNB.) SIEB. with inhibitory activity (&gt;90%) at a concentration of 100 microg/ml.	magnolia officinalis cancer
2	In vitro anti-Helicobacter pylori action of 30 Chinese herbal medicines used to treat ulcer diseases.Infection by Helicobacter pylori has been ascertained to be an important etiologic impetus leading usually to chronic active gastritis and gastric ulcer with growing incidences worldwide. Utilizing as the test pathogen a standard and five clinic strains of Helicobacter pylori, the antibacterial action was assessed in vitro with ethanol extracts of 30 Chinese herbal medicines which have been frequently prescribed since ancient times for treating gastritis-like disorders. Among the 30 tested materials, the ethanol extracts of Abrus cantoniensis (Fabaceae), Saussurea lappa (Asteraceae) and Eugenia caryophyllata (Myrtaceae) were strongly inhibitory to all test strains (MICs: approximately 40 microg/ml), and Hippophae rhamnoides (Elaeagnaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii (Liliaceae), Magnolia officinalis and Schisandra chinensis (Magnoliaceae), Corydalis yanhusuo (Papaveraceae), Citrus reticulata (Rutaceae), Bupleurum chinense and Ligusticum chuanxiong (Apiaceae) substantially active with MICs close to 60.0 microg/ml. As to antibacterial actions of the aqueous extracts of the same drugs, those derived from Cassia obtusifolia (Fabaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii and Eugenia caryophyllata were remarkably inhibitory against all the six Helicobacter pylori strains (MICs: approximately 60 microg/ml). The work compared almost quantitatively the magnitude of the anti-Helicobacter pylori actions of the 30 most prescribed gastritis-treating Chinese herbal drugs, and located as well some source plants where potent anti-Helicobacter pylori phytochemicals could be characterized.	ligusticum chuanxiong ulcer diseases
4	Combined treatment with Cinnamaldehyde and beta-TCP had an additive effect on bone formation and angiogenesis in critical size calvarial defect in ovariectomized rats.Accumulating evidence suggests that improvements in osteogenesis and angiogenesis play an important role in repairing osteoporotic bone defects. Cinnamomum cassia (C. cassia), a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, is reported to show anabolic effects on osteoblasts. However, whether C. cassia could actually repair bone defects in osteoporotic conditions remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of combined treatment with Cinnamaldehyde (main oil isolated from the C. cassia) and beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP) on bone formation and angiogenesis in critical size calvarial defects in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Using a previously established OVX model, 5 mm critical size calvarial defect was established in OVX rats. All OVX rats were then randomly divided into OVX group (OVX rats + empty defect), TCP group (OVX rats + beta-TCP), and CTCP group (Cinnamaldehyde 75 mg/kg/day for 12 weeks + beta-TCP). Twelve weeks after treatment, according to Micro-CT and HE staining, combination of Cinnamaldehyde and beta-TCP had an additive effect on bone regeneration compared with other groups (p &lt; 0.05). Based on dynamic fluorochrome-labelling analysis, Cinnamaldehyde+beta-TCP continuously promoted new bone mineralization compared with other groups at each time point (p &lt; 0.05). Microfil perfusion suggested that CTCP group showed more neovascularization compared with other groups (p &lt; 0.05). Immunohistochemical assay supported the findings that Cinnamaldehyde+beta-TCP enhanced expression of OCN, VEGF and CD31. The present study demonstrated that combined treatment with Cinnamaldehyde and beta-TCP promoted bone formation and angiogenesis in osteoporotic bone defects, which provides a promising new strategy for repairing bone defects in osteoporotic conditions.

1	The cardioprotective effect of total flavonoids on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion in rats.The flowers of Abelmoschus manihot (L.) Medic is a traditional Chinese medicine used for the treatment of ischemic diseases. The present study is to investigate whether total flavones (TA) of extracted from Abelmoschus manihot L. Medic has the potential cardioprotective effect on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) damage in rats. The index of myocardial injury, inflammatory biomarkers and NLRP3-related parameters were measured, respectively. The results demonstrated that compared to I/R group, TA reduced myocardial infarction area, declined serum creatinine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, attenuated serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1beta and tumour necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) production. Moreover, TA markedly enhanced the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and reduced the amounts of malondialdehyde (MDA) in I/R rats. In addition, TA reduced myocardial I/R induced injury in rats by inhibiting NLRPR3 inflammasome. Thus, it is assumed that TA could significantly improve myocardial I/R injury in rats partially through suppressing NLRP3 activtion.	abelmoschus manihot flavonoids
3	In vitro efficacy of 75 essential oils against Aspergillus niger.Aspergillus niger is an opportunistic human pathogen and a strong air pollutant. A study was conducted with 75 different essential oils for the inhibition of hyphal growth and spore formation in Aspergillus niger. Cinnamomum zeylanicum (bark), Cinnamomum zeylanicum (leaf), Cinnamomum cassia, Syzygium aromaticum and Cymbopogon citratus were the top five essential oils which demonstrated marked inhibitory effect against hyphal growth and spore formation of A. niger. The chemical composition of these five most active essential oils was investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectra (GC-MS). Most of the other essential oils were found challenging to combat A. niger, suggesting their use as strong aroma therapeutic agents.	essential oils hyphal growth
1	Extraction of Flavonoids from the Flowers of Abelmoschus manihot (L.) Medic by Modified Supercritical CO2 Extraction and Determination of Antioxidant and Anti-Adipogenic Activity.Abelmoschus manihot (L.) Medic has been used for many years in Chinese traditional medicine. In this study, supercritical CO2 plus a modifier was utilized to extract flavonoids from the flowers of Abelmoschus manihot (L.) Medic. The effects of temperature (40  C-60  C), pressure (10-30 MPa) and different concentrations of ethanol as modifier (60%-90%, ethanol:water, v/v) on major flavonol content and the antioxidant activity of the extracts were studied by response surface methodology (RSM) using a Box-Behnken design. The flavonol content was calculated as the sum of the concentrations of seven major flavonoids, namely rutin, hyperin, isoquercetin, hibifolin, myricetin, quercetin-3'-O-glucoside and quercetin, which were simultaneously determined by a HPLC method. The antioxidant activity was evaluated by a 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydarzyl (DPPH) free radical-scavenging assay. The results showed that three factors and their interactions could be well fitted to second-order polynomial models (p &lt; 0.05). At the optimal extraction conditions for flavonol content (20 MPa, 52  C, and 85% ethanol content), the yield of flavonoids was 41.96 mg/g and the IC50 value was 0.288 mg/mL, respectively, suggesting the extract has high antioxidant activity. Furthermore, the anti-adipogenic activity of the extract on the 3T3-L1 cell line was investigated. The results indicated that it can downregulate PPARgamma and C/EBPalpha expression at mRNA. In summary, in this study, we have established a cost-effective method for the extraction of flavonoids from the flowers of Abelmoschus manihot (L.) Medic using supercritical fluid extraction and the extracts exhibited potent antioxidant and anti-adipogenic effects, suggesting a possible therapeutic approach for the prevention and treatment of obesity. 	abelmoschus manihot flavonoids
1	Inhibition of in-vitro growth of Plasmodium falciparum by Pseudocedrela kotschyi extract alone and in combination with Fagara zanthoxyloides extract.Roots of Pseudocedrela kotschyi are commonly used as chewing sticks in West Africa. This study examined the effects of the plant extract on the in-vitro growth of Plasmodium falciparum. Ring-stage synchronised cultures of the malaria parasite were exposed to 30 and 60 microg/ml of P. kotschyi extract for 51 h. Aliquots were taken from the cultures every 3 h for preparation of Giemsa-stained thin films, which were evaluated by light microscopy for degree of parasitaemia and stage distribution of parasite development. The extracts did not show any inhibitory effects on the emergence of trophozoites in treated cultures. However, the results indicate that 80% of inhibition of the parasite transformation into schizont was obtained for both tested concentrations (30 and 60 microg/ml). Experiments with (3)H-hypoxanthine incorporation showed an IC(50) of 16 microg/ml for the Pseudocedrela extract. Pseudocedrela was combined with extract of Fagara zanthoxyloides in various concentrations to determine their interactive effects on the in-vitro cultures. Isobologram analysis of the results indicated a synergistic interaction between the two extracts at low concentrations, while interactions at higher concentrations showed antagonistic effects.

1	Antibacterial alkaloids from Zanthoxylum rhoifolium.Two new dihydrobenzophenanthridine-type alkaloids, 6-methoxy dioxolo[4',5':4,5]benzo[c] dioxolo[4,5- j]phenanthridine (1) and 2,3,13-trimethoxy-5,11a-dihydro dioxolo[4',5':4,5]benzo[c]phenanthridine (2) were isolated from the stem bark of Zanthoxylum rhoifolium, together with four other previously known benzophenanthridine alkaloids, 6-acetonyldihydronitidine (3) [= 8-acetonyldihydronitidine], 6-acetonyldihydroavicine (4) [= 8-acetonyldihydroavicine], 6-acetonyldihydrochelerythrine (5) and xanthoxyline (6). The structures were elucidated mainly by spectroscopic methods, including 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. For alkaloids 1 and 2 we propose the trivial names rhoifolines A and B. The crude plant extracts and the alkaloids 3, 4 and 6 showed activity against Gram (+/-) bacteria, while the new alkaloids 1 and 2 were inactive.	zanthoxylum rhoifolium rhoifolines
1	Structures of new phenylbutanoids and nitric oxide production inhibitors from the rhizomes of Zingiber cassumunar.The methanolic (MeOH) extract from the rhizomes of Zingiber cassumunar showed nitric oxide (NO) production inhibitory effects induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mouse peritoneal macrophages. From the MeOH extract, six new phenylbutanoids, phlains I-VI, were isolated together with 16 known constituents. The structures of new phenylbutanoids were determined on the basis of physicochemical and chemical evidence. In addition, the inhibitory effects of the principal constituents on the NO production were examined. Among them, phlain III (IC50=24 microM), (E)-1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)buta-1,3-diene (69 microM), (E)-1-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)buta-1,3-diene (83 microM), and cassumunaquinone 1 (47 microM) were found to show the inhibitory effects.	zingiber cassumunar cassumunaquinone
3	Cinnamomulactone, a new butyrolactone from the twigs of Cinnamomum cassia and its inhibitory activity of matrix metalloproteinases.Cinnamomum cassia (Lauraceae) has long been used as one of the most frequently used traditional oriental medicines for the treatment of gastritis, diabetes, blood circulation disturbance and inflammatory diseases. Cinnamomulactone (1), a new butyrolactone was isolated from the twigs of C. cassia together with nine known compounds, coumarin (2), trans-cinnamic acid (3), cinnamaldehyde (4), 2-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (5), 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde (6), 2-hydroxy-cinnamyl alcohol (7), benzoic acid (8), (+)-syringaresinol (9) and phenethyl (E)-3-[4-methoxyphenyl]-2-propenoate (10). The planar structure of 1 was elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic data analysis and its configurations were determined by coupling constant (3 J HH) analysis and a comparison with specific rotation data of related compounds on the literatures. The structures of known compounds were confirmed by the comparison of their spectroscopic data to the reported values. Compound 10 was isolated for the first time from this plant. Compounds 1, 2, 4, and 9 showed inhibitory activity against matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) gene expression. Among them, compound 1 has been revealed to suppress the gene expression of MMP-3 and interleukin (IL)-1beta as well as MMP-1 in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha stimulated rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts.

1	In vitro activities of plant extracts on human Loa loa isolates and cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells.Loa loa, a filarial worm, can cause fatal encephalitis in humans. In an attempt to find alternatives to the standard treatments (ivermectin and diethylcarbamazine citrate), we tested 12 methanolic extracts of nine traditional plant remedies. The extracts (100-0.09 microg/ml) were incubated with 20 Loa loa microfilariae isolated from patients at 37 degrees C with 5% CO(2) in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal serum and antibiotics. Activity was evaluated 120 h later by counting live microfilariae under a microscope. Cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells was estimated by measuring 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2-5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide transformation to formazan at 450 nM in a spectrophotometer. The plants tested were Lophira alata, Greenwayodendron suaveolens, Uapaca togoensis, Zanthoxylum heitzii, Peperomia pellucida, Piptadeniastrum africanum, Petersianthus macrocarpus, Vernonia conferta, and Vernonia hymenolepis. Chemical screening showed that most of the extracts contained reducing sugars, tannin or polyphenols, sterols or triterpenes, saponosides, and alkaloids. None contained carotinoids and few contained flavonoids. The 50% lethal concentration ranged from 0.22 to 70.28 microg/ml, while the 50% inhibitory concentration for eukaryotic cells (IC(50)) ranged from 8.52 to 119.52 microg/ml. Extracts of P. macrocarpus (selectivity index = 72.16), P. africanum (13.69), Z. heitzii (12.11), and L. alata (9.26) were highly selective for L. loa.	l. alata tannin

2	In vitro anti-Helicobacter pylori action of 30 Chinese herbal medicines used to treat ulcer diseases.Infection by Helicobacter pylori has been ascertained to be an important etiologic impetus leading usually to chronic active gastritis and gastric ulcer with growing incidences worldwide. Utilizing as the test pathogen a standard and five clinic strains of Helicobacter pylori, the antibacterial action was assessed in vitro with ethanol extracts of 30 Chinese herbal medicines which have been frequently prescribed since ancient times for treating gastritis-like disorders. Among the 30 tested materials, the ethanol extracts of Abrus cantoniensis (Fabaceae), Saussurea lappa (Asteraceae) and Eugenia caryophyllata (Myrtaceae) were strongly inhibitory to all test strains (MICs: approximately 40 microg/ml), and Hippophae rhamnoides (Elaeagnaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii (Liliaceae), Magnolia officinalis and Schisandra chinensis (Magnoliaceae), Corydalis yanhusuo (Papaveraceae), Citrus reticulata (Rutaceae), Bupleurum chinense and Ligusticum chuanxiong (Apiaceae) substantially active with MICs close to 60.0 microg/ml. As to antibacterial actions of the aqueous extracts of the same drugs, those derived from Cassia obtusifolia (Fabaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii and Eugenia caryophyllata were remarkably inhibitory against all the six Helicobacter pylori strains (MICs: approximately 60 microg/ml). The work compared almost quantitatively the magnitude of the anti-Helicobacter pylori actions of the 30 most prescribed gastritis-treating Chinese herbal drugs, and located as well some source plants where potent anti-Helicobacter pylori phytochemicals could be characterized.	abrus cantoniensis gastritis
1	Phenylpropanoids from cinnamon bark reduced beta-amyloid production by the inhibition of beta-secretase in Chinese hamster ovarian cells stably expressing amyloid precursor protein.beta-Amyloid (Abeta) is a substance of Alzheimer disease (AD), which is generated via the amyloidogenic pathway from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-secretase and gamma-secretase. Inhibition of Abeta production is a potential therapeutic approach to AD. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that cinnamon bark (Cinnamomi Cortex Spissus), the dried bark of Cinnamomum cassia Blume (Lauraceae), and its constituents are beneficial to AD. The methanol extract of cinnamon bark efficiently reduced Abeta40 production in Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cells stably expressing APP as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Bioassay-guided isolation of cinnamon bark extract was carried out using open column chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography, and the following 6 phenylpropanoids were isolated: syringaresinol (1); medioresinol (2); coumarin (3); 2-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (4); cryptamygin A (5); and 3',5,7-trimethoxy epicatechin (6). Among these, 4 mug/mL medioresinol and cryptamygin A reduced Abeta40 production by 50% and 60%, respectively, compared with dimethyl sulfoxide-treated control cells. The IC50 values of medioresinol and cryptamygin A for the inhibition of Abeta40 production were 10.8 and 8.2 mug/mL, respectively. Furthermore, treatment of APP-CHO cells with either compound decreased the amount of beta-secretase and sAPPbeta (the proteolytic fragment of APP catalyzed by beta-secretase). These results suggest that the antiamyloidogenic activity of cinnamon bark extract was exerted by medioresinol and cryptamygin A via a reduction in the amount of beta-secretase. The extract of cinnamon bark contains potentially valuable antiamyloidogenic agents for the prevention and treatment of AD.	cinnamon cryptamygin a
1	SPE-HPLC method for the determination of four flavonols in rat plasma and urine after oral administration of Abelmoschus manihot extract.A SPE-HPLC method was developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of flavonols, isoquercitrin (1), hibifolin (2), myricetin (3), quercetin-3'-O-d-glucoside (4) and quercetin (5) in rat plasma and urine after oral administration of the total flavonoids from Abelmoschus manihot (TFA). The astragalin (6) and kaempferol (7) were used as internal standards (IS). Plasma and urine samples were pretreated by solid-phase extraction using Winchem C(18) reversed-phase cartridges. Analysis of the plasma and urinary extract was performed on YMC-Pack ODS-A C(18) and Thermo ODS-2HYEPRSIL C(18) reversed-phase column, respectively and a mobile phase of acetonitrile-0.1% phosphoric acid was employed. HPLC analysis was conducted with different elution gradients. The flow rate was 1.0 mL/min and the detection wavelength was set at 370 nm. Calibration ranges in plasma for flavonols 2-5 were at 0.011-2.220, 0.014-2.856, 0.022-4.320, and 0.028-5.600 microg/mL, respectively. In urine calibration ranges for flavonols 1, 2, 4 and 5 were at 2.00-16.00, 8.56-102.72, 2.70-21.60, and 3.00-24.00 microg/mL, respectively. The RSD of intra- and inter-day was less than 5.40% and 4.89% in plasma, and less than 3.96% and 6.85% in urine for all the analyses. A preliminary experiment to investigate the plasma concentration and urinary excretion of the flavonols after oral administration of TFA to rats demonstrated that the present method was suitable for determining the flavonols in rat plasma and urine.	abelmoschus manihot flavonols
4	Antiproliferative Activity of Cinnamomum cassia Constituents and Effects of Pifithrin-Alpha on Their Apoptotic Signaling Pathways in Hep G2 Cells.Cinnamaldehyde (Cin), cinnamic acid (Ca) and cinnamyl alcohol (Cal), major constituents of Cinnamomum cassia, have been shown to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer and other activities. In this study, our aim was to evaluate the antiproliferative activity of these compounds in human hepatoma Hep G2 cells and examine the effects of pifithrin-alpha (PFTalpha; a specific p53 inhibitor) on their apoptotic signaling transduction mechanism. The antiproliferative activity was measured by XTT assay. Expression of apoptosis-related proteins was detected by western blotting. Results showed that at a concentration of 30 muM, the order of antiproliferative activity in Hep G2 cells was Cin &gt; Ca &gt; Cal. Cin (IC(50) 9.76 +- 0.67 muM) demonstrated an antiproliferative potency as good as 5-fluorouracil (an anti-cancer drug; IC(50) 9.57 +- 0.61 muM). Further studies on apoptotic mechanisms of Cin showed that it downregulated the expression of Bcl-(XL), upregulated CD95 (APO-1), p53 and Bax proteins, as well as cleaving the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in a time-dependent pattern. PFTalpha pre-incubation significantly diminished the effect of Cin-induced apoptosis. It markedly upregulated the anti-apoptotic (Bcl-(XL)) expression and downregulated the pro-apoptotic (Bax) expression, as well as effectively blocking the CD95 (APO-1) and p53 expression, and PARP cleavage in Cin-treated cells. This study indicates that Cin was the most potent antiproliferative constituent of C. cassia, and its apoptotic mechanism in Hep G2 cells could be mediated through the p53 induction and CD95 (APO-1) signaling pathways.

1	Feeding deterrents from Zanthoxylum schinifolium against two stored-product insects.Screening for insecticidal principles from several Chinese medicinal herbs showed that the fruit pericarp of Zanthoxylum schinifolium possessed significant feeding deterrence against two stored-product insects (Tribolium castaneum and Sitophilus zeamais). From the methanol extract, two feeding deterrents were isolated by bioassay-guided fractionation. The compounds were identified as schinifoline and skimmianine from their spectroscopic data. Schinifoline has feeding deterrent activity against T. castaneum and S. zeamais adults with EC(50) values of 47.8 and 85.6 ppm respectively. Skimmianine possess feeding deterrent activity against T. castaneum and S. zeamais adults with EC(50) values of 75.7 and 129.7 ppm respectively.	zanthoxylum schinifolium Schinifoline
1	Miscellaneous terpenoid constituents of Abies nephrolepis and their moderate cytotoxic activities.Three monoterpenoids and two triterpenoids were isolated from Abies nephrolepis together with 53 known terpenoids. The structures of the compounds were established by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. The absolute configuration of 3-hydroxycamphane-2-carboxylic acid was established as (1S,2R,3S,4R) by Cu-Kalpha X-ray crystallography. All 58 isolates were tested for cytotoxic activity against four tumor cells viz. A549 (human lung adenocarcinoma), Colo205 (colon adenocarcinoma), QGY-7703 (human hepatoma) and THP-1 (human monocytic leukemia). alpha-Cadinol exhibited the best effects on A549, Colo205 and QGY-7703 with IC(50) values of 8.6, 8.1 and 4.6 mug/mL, respectively.	abies nephrolepis monoterpenoids
2	Effect of the herbal medicine dai-kenchu-to on gastrointestinal motility in patients with megacystis-microcolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIHS) and chronic idiopathic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIIP): report of two cases.Dai-kenchu-to (DKT), a traditional Japanese herbal medicine (Kampo medicine), composed of zanthoxylum fruit, ginseng root, dried ginger rhizome and malt sugar, is clinically effective for postoperative ileus and chronic constipation. MMIHS and CIIP are severe motility disorder associated with high morbidity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of DKT on functional intestinal obstruction. DKT was clinically effective for gastrointestinal motility in a case with MMIHS, but not effective in one with CIIP. MMIHS and CIIP are speculated to have different pathogenesis regarding gastrointestinal pseudo-obstruction based upon the effect of this drug.	ginseng gastrointestinal motility
1	Differences in pigment composition, photosynthetic rates and chlorophyll fluorescence images of sun and shade leaves of four tree species.The differential pigment composition and photosynthetic activity of sun and shade leaves of deciduous (Acer pseudoplatanus, Fagus sylvatica, Tilia cordata) and coniferous (Abies alba) trees was comparatively determined by studying the photosynthetic rates via CO(2) measurements and also by imaging the Chl fluorescence decrease ratio (R(Fd)), which is an in vivo indicator of the net CO(2) assimilation rates. The thicker sun leaves and needles in all tree species were characterized by a lower specific leaf area, lower water content, higher total chlorophyll (Chl) a+b and total carotenoid (Cars) content per leaf area unit, as well as higher values for the ratio Chl a/b compared to the much thinner shade leaves and needles that possess a higher Chl a+b and Cars content on a dry matter basis and higher values for the weight ratio Chls/Cars. Sun leaves and needles exhibited higher rates of maximum net photosynthetic CO(2) assimilation (P(Nmax)) measured at saturating irradiance associated with higher maximum stomatal conductance for water vapor efflux. The differences in photosynthetic activity between sun and shade leaves and needles could also be sensed via imaging the Chl fluorescence decrease ratio R(Fd), since it linearly correlated to the P(Nmax) rates at saturating irradiance. Chl fluorescence imaging not only provided the possibility to screen the differences in P(N) rates between sun and shade leaves, but in addition permitted detection and quantification of the large gradients in photosynthetic rates across the leaf area existing in sun and shade leaves.	acer pseudoplatanus chlorophyll
1	Lifting properties of the alkamide fraction from the fruit husks of Zanthoxylum bungeanum.The fruits of various Zanthoxylum species are used as a spice in the Chinese and Japanese cuisine because of their delicate flavour and tingling properties. The lipophilic hydroxyalkamides hydroxy alpha- and beta-sanshools (1a,b) have been identified as the tingling principles of these plants, and previous studies have validated a sanshool-rich lipophilic extract from the fruit husks of Z. bungeanum Maxim. (Zanthalene   ) as an anti-itching cosmetic ingredient. Because tingling is a sort of 'paralytic pungency', and Zanthalene   potently inhibits synaptic transmission, we have investigated its capacity to relax subcutaneous muscles and act as a topical lifting agent for wrinkles. An anti-wrinkles extract rich in spilanthol (2), a lipophilic alkamide having sensory properties similar to those of Zanthalene   , was used as a reference. Short-term (lifting effect) and long-term (anti-wrinkle) improvements of skin roughness parameters were evaluated by both objectives' and subjectives' measurements. An immediate 'lifting' effect was observed with the sanshool-rich lipophilic extract, at dosages at which the reference alkamide extract was inactive in the objective assays. Limited desensitization after repeated application and good overall tolerability were observed, although a modest long-term anti-wrinkle effect was shown by both products. Taken together, these observations validate the use of sanshool-rich lipophilic extracts as an efficacious, immediate-action lifting agent, and exemplify the relevance of sensory observations to foster the development of innovative cosmetic ingredients.	z. bungeanum maxim Zanthalene
3	Bioassay-guided studies on the cytotoxic and in vitro trypanocidal activities of a sesquiterpene (Muzigadial) derived from a Ugandan medicinal plant (Warburgia ugandensis).Trypanosomosis is arguably the most important disease of man and his domesticated animals in the tropics. There are few compounds available for its treatment. This has exacerbated the development of drug resistance. There is therefore urgent need to search for newer compounds to treat this important disease. Medicinal plants represent a potential source of the drugs. This paper reports a bioassay-guided study to search for possible biological activity (cytotoxic and trypanocidal) in two Ugandan medicinal plants. The methodology adopted was the so-called 'ping-pong' approach, involving phytochemical purification (column chromatography and preparative thin layer chromatography), alongside biological studies (cytotoxicity, antibacterial, trypanocidal and antifungal studies). Phytochemical investigations of Zanthoxylum chalybeum (seed) yielded a pure crystalline compound, 27-135D, which was characterized by 'HNMR as the alkaloid skimmianine. Studies on stem bark yielded three alkaloids 27-165A, 27-173A and 27-173B. All the above pure isolates, and the crude extracts of Z. chalybeum had neither biological activity nor cytotoxicity in the brine shrimp assay. A cytotoxic sesquiterpine, characterized as muzigadial, was isolated from W. ugandensis. It was highly toxic in the brine shrimp assay and also had in vitro trypanocidal activity against IL 3338 as well as IL1180; reference drug-resistant and drug-sensitive trypanosome strains respectively, comparable to diminazene aceturate and Geneticin (G418). Muzigadial also had antifungal activity against Candida albicans. It was concluded that the brine shrimp assay might be a useful predictor of trypanocidal activity of plant extracts and that muzigadial may be potentially valuable in the treatment of drug-resistant trypanosomosis.	sesquiterpine cytotoxicity
4	PUMA dependent mitophagy by Abrus agglutinin contributes to apoptosis through ceramide generation.PUMA, a BH3-only pro-apoptotic Bcl2 family protein, is known to translocate from the cytosol into the mitochondria in order to induce apoptosis. Interestingly, the induction of PUMA by p53 plays a critical role in DNA damage-induced apoptosis. In this study, we reported mitophagy inducing potential of PUMA triggered by phytolectin Abrus agglutinin (AGG) in U87MG glioblastoma cells and established AGG-induced ceramide acts as the chief mediator of mitophagy dependent cell death through activation of both mitochondrial ROS as well as ER stress. Importantly, AGG upregulates PUMA expression in U87MG cells with the generation of dysfunctional mitochondria, with gain and loss of function of PUMA is shown to alter mitophagy induction. At the molecular level, our study identified that the LC3 interacting region (LIR) located at the C-terminal end of PUMA interacts with LC3 in order to stimulate mitophagy. In addition, AGG is also found to trigger ubiquitination of PUMA which in turn interacted with p62 for prompting mitophagy suggesting that AGG turns on PUMA-mediated mitophagy in U87MG cells in both p62-dependent as well as in p62-independent manner. Interestingly, AGG-triggered ceramide production through activation of ceramide synthase-1 leads to induction of ER stress and ROS accumulation to promote mitochondrial damage as well as mitophagy. Further, upon pre-treatment with Mdivi-1, DRP1 inhibitor, AGG exposure results in suppression of apoptosis in U87MG cells indicating AGG-induced mitophagy switches to apoptosis that can be exploited for better cancer therapeutics.

2	Screening of some Tanzanian medicinal plants for their trypanocidal and cytotoxic activities.The objective of the present study was to evaluate in vitro antitrypanosomal and cytotoxic activities of crude extracts of 20 traditionally used medicinal plants of Tanzania. A total of 40 extracts (dichloromethane and methanol) were screened for antiproliferative activity of bloodstream form of T. b. brucei and human leukaemia HL-60 cell. Inhibition of cell proliferation was assessed using resazurin as vital stain. Of the 40 extracts tested, the dichloromethane extract from bark of Warburgia salutaris (Canellaceae) exhibited the most potent antitrypanosomal activity with an IC(50) value of 10.68 microg/ml. A dichloromethane extract from Lannea stuhlmannii (Anacardiaceae) was found to be the most cytotoxic extract against HL-60 (IC(50) = 27.15 microg/ml). Out of the 20 plants tested, 5 plants exhibited trypanocidal activity with IC(50) values below 20 microg/ml. These 5 plants: Entandrophragma bussei (Meliaceae), Securidaca longepedunculata (Polygalaceae), Warburgia salutaris (Canellaceae), Zanha africana (Sapindaceae) and Zanthoxylum chalybeum (Rutaceae) could therefore serve as sources of lead compounds for treatment of trypanosomiasis.	zanha africana trypanosomiasis
3	MAPK inhibitors and pifithrin-alpha block cinnamaldehyde-induced apoptosis in human PLC/PRF/5 cells.Cinnamaldehyde (Cin) has been shown to be effective in inducing apoptotic cell death in a number of human cancer cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of pifithrin-alpha (PFTalpha; a specific p53 inhibitor) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) inhibitors [namely SP600125 (a specific JNK inhibitor), SB203580 (a specific p38 inhibitor) and PD98059 (a specific ERK inhibitor)] on apoptotic signaling transduction mechanism induced by Cin in human hepatoma PLC/PRF/5 (CD95-negative) cells. Using XTT assay, Cin exhibited a powerful cytotoxic effect and apoptotic induction in PLC/PRF/5 cells. Apoptosis was elicited when cells were treated with 1 microM Cin as characterized by morphological changes and the appearance of phosphatidylserine on the outer surface of the plasma membrane. Cin down-regulated the expression of Bcl-(XL), up-regulated mutant p53 and Bax proteins and promoted caspase-3 to active forms, as well as cleaving poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in a time-dependent pattern. This could be supported by the activation and phosphorylation of MAPKs, including JNK, ERK and p38 kinases. Pre-incubation with PFTalpha and specific MAPK inhibitors significantly diminished the effect of Cin-induced apoptosis. The activities of anti-apoptotic (Bcl-(XL)) and pro-apoptotic (Bax) proteins were remarkably affected by PFTalpha and PD98059 pre-treatment. PFTalpha effectively blocked PARP cleavage in cells treated with Cin, and also markedly prevented the phosphorylation of JNK, p38 and ERK proteins. These results suggest that p53 induction and MAPK signaling pathways are required for Cin-mediated apoptosis in PLC/PRF/5 cells.	Cin cancer
3	Immunosuppressive Effects of A-Type Procyanidin Oligomers from Cinnamomum tamala.Cinnamon barks extracts have been reported to regulate immune function; however, the component(s) in cinnamon barks responsible for this effect is/are not yet clear. The aim of this study is to find out the possible component(s) that can be used as therapeutic agents for immune-related diseases from cinnamon bark. In this study, the immunosuppressive effects of fraction (named CT-F) and five procyanidin oligomers compounds, cinnamtannin B1, cinnamtannin D1 (CTD-1), parameritannin A1, procyanidin B2, and procyanidin C1, from Cinnamomum tamala or Cinnamomum cassia bark were examined on splenocytes proliferation model induced by ConA or LPS. Then, the effects of activated compound CTD-1 on cytokine production and 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) induced delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response were detected to evaluate the immunosuppressive activity of CTD-1. It was found that CT-F and CTD-1 significantly inhibited the splenocyte proliferation induced by ConA or LPS. CTD-1 dose-dependently reduced the level of IFN-gamma and IL-2 and intensively suppressed DNFB-induced DTH responses. These findings suggest that the immunosuppressive activities of cinnamon bark are in part due to procyanidin oligomers. CTD-1 may be a potential therapeutic agent for immune-related diseases. 	procyanidin hypersensitivity
1	Chitosan and a fungal elicitor inhibit tracheary element differentiation and promote accumulation of stress lignin-like substance in Zinnia elegans xylogenic culture.We investigated the effect of elicitors on xylem differentiation and lignification using a Zinnia elegans xylogenic culture system. Water-soluble chitosan and a fungal elicitor derived from Botrytis cinerea were used as elicitors. Elicitor addition at the start of culturing inhibited tracheary element (TE) differentiation in a concentration-dependent manner, and 30 mug mL(-1) of chitosan or 16.7 mug mL(-1) of the fungal elicitor strikingly inhibited TE differentiation and lignification. Addition of chitosan (at 50 mug mL(-1)) or the fungal elicitor (at 16.7 mug mL(-1)) during the culturing period also inhibited TE differentiation without inhibiting cell division, except for immature TEs undergoing secondary wall thickening. Elicitor addition after immature TE appearance also caused the accumulation of an extracellular lignin-like substance. It appears that elicitor addition at the start of culturing inhibits the process by which dedifferentiated cells differentiate into xylem cell precursors. Elicitor addition during culturing also appears to inhibit the transition from xylem cell precursors to immature TEs, and induces xylem cell precursors or xylem parenchyma cells to produce an extracellular stress lignin-like substance. 	zinnia elegans lignin
3	Inhibitory effect of 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde on nitric oxide production through inhibition of NF-kappa B activation in RAW 264.7 cells.Cinnamomum cassia has been widely used for treating dyspepsia, gastritis, and inflammatory disease. In the present study, several of cinnamaldehyde derivatives were synthesized from various cinnamic acid based on the 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde isolated from the bark C. cassia Blume was investigated to compare their NO production and NF-kappa B activity from Raw 264.7 cell since nitric oxide (NO) and NF-kappa B have been shown to be implicated factors in the inflammatory disease. The results show that HCA, among the derivatives, most significantly inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NO production and NF-kappa B transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner with an IC(50) value of 8 and 22 microM, respectively. We next investigated putative possible mechanisms of inhibitory effect of HCA on NO production. The inhibition of NO by HCA was consistent with the inhibitory effect on LPS-induced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression. Moreover, HCA inhibited LPS-induced p50 and p65 translocation resulting in the inhibition of the DNA binding activity of the NF-kappa B, a central regulator of iNOS. The present results provided evidence that HCA, among cinnamaledhyde derivatives, has the most inhibitory effect on NO production through inhibition of NF-kappa B activation, and thus can be used as an anti-inflammatory agent.	2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde inflammatory disease
3	Gastroprotective Activity of the Total Flavones from Abelmoschus manihot (L.) Medic Flowers.Background: Abelmoschus manihot (L.) Medic flower is a medicinal plant for the treatment of diseases in China. The present study was carried out to scientifically validate the gastroprotective activity and clarify the possible mechanism of the total flavones from Abelmoschus manihot (L.) Medic flower is a medicinal plant for the treatment of diseases in China. The present study was carried out to scientifically validate the gastroprotective activity and clarify the possible mechanism of the total flavones from. Methods: Gastric ulcer was induced in mice by oral administration of ethanol. The gastroprotective activity of TFA was evaluated by the gastric ulcer index and histological examinations. The gastric tissue was collected in the form of homogenate. The level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH), the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), and protein content were measured. Western blotting for the expression of Bax, Bcl-2, TNF-alpha, and NF-kappaB(p65) was also carried out. The effect of TFA was compared with that of standard antiulcer drug omeprazole (100 mg/kg). Results: This gastroprotective effect of TFA could be attributed to the increase in the activity of SOD and GSH and decrease in the levels of MDA and also decrease in the levels of Bax, TNF-alpha, and NF-kappaB(p65) was also carried out. The effect of TFA was compared with that of standard antiulcer drug omeprazole (100 mg/kg).

1	Downscaling of Industrial Turbo-Distillation to Laboratory Turbo-Clevenger for Extraction of Essential Oils. Application of Concepts of Green Analytical Chemistry.In the effort of innovation towards green analytical chemistry concepts and considering the six principles of green extraction, the industrial turbodistillation process was downscaled into a laboratory apparatus turbo-Clevenger (TC) for the extraction of essential oils. Turbodistillation is used as an industrial purpose for the extraction of essential oils from hard matrixes such as wood, barks, seeds. In this work, a TC and the conventional technique of hydrodistillation (HD, Clevenger apparatus) are used for the extraction of essential oils from three spices with hard structures (Illicium verum, Schinus terebinthifolius, and Cinnamomum cassia) and are compared. This study shows that the essential oils extracted by TC in 30 min were quantitatively (yield and kinetics profile) and qualitatively (aromatic profile) similar to those obtained using conventional hydrodistillation in 3 h. This process, which gave a reduced extraction time, was perfectly adapted to the extraction of hard matrixes.	illicium verum essential oils
2	Inhibitory effect of phytoglycoprotein (115 kDa) on the expression of TNF-alpha and interleukin-1beta via inhibition of MAP kinase in primary cultured mouse thymocytes.The present study was performed to investigate the anti-inflammatory potential of 115 kDa glycoprotein isolated from Zanthoxylum piperitum DC leaves (ZPDC glycoprotein) in primary cultured mouse thymocytes. To determine whether the ZPDC glycoprotein has inhibitory capacity against inflammation in vitro, we evaluated the activities of inflammation-related factors such as phosphorylations of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, and the activities of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetata (PMA, 50 nM)-treated mouse thymocytes. Our results showed that the ZPDC glycoprotein (200 mug/ml) has a suppressive effect on the expression of MAPK (ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK), on mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-1beta), and on protein expression of pro-inflammatory proteins (iNOS and COX-2). We speculate that the ZPDC glycoprotein is an example of a natural compound that blocks pro-inflammatory signal transduction pathways.	zanthoxylum piperitum inflammation
3	A 'toothache tree' alkylamide inhibits Adelta mechanonociceptors to alleviate mechanical pain.In traditional medicine, the 'toothache tree' and other plants of the Zanthoxylum genus have been used to treat inflammatory pain conditions, such as toothache and rheumatoid arthritis. Here we examined the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the analgesic properties of hydroxy-alpha-sanshool, the active alkylamide produced by Zanthoxylum plants. Consistent with its analgesic effects in humans, sanshool treatment in mice caused a selective attenuation of mechanical sensitivity under naive and inflammatory conditions, with no effect on thermal sensitivity. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which sanshool attenuates mechanical pain, we performed single fibre recordings, calcium imaging and whole-cell electrophysiology of cultured sensory neurons. We found that: (1) sanshool potently inhibits Adelta mechanonociceptors that mediate both sharp acute pain and inflammatory pain; (2) sanshool inhibits action potential firing by blocking voltage-gated sodium currents in a subset of somatosensory neurons, which express a unique combination of voltage-gated sodium channels; and (3) heterologously expressed Nav1.7 is most strongly inhibited by sanshool as compared to other sodium channels expressed in sensory neurons. These results suggest that sanshool targets voltage-gated sodium channels on Adelta mechanosensory nociceptors to dampen excitability and thus induce 'fast pain' analgesia.	alkylamide pain

1	Triterpenoids isolated from Zizyphus jujuba inhibit foam cell formation in macrophages.Because foam cell formation in macrophages is believed to play an essential role in the progression of early atherosclerotic lesions in vivo, prevention of foam cell formation is considered to be one of the major targets for the treatment of atherosclerosis. The present study examined the inhibitory effect of 50 crude plant extracts on foam cell formation. Among those crude extracts, Zizyphi Fructus (ZF) and Zizyphi Semen (ZS) extracts significantly inhibited the foam cell formation induced by acetylated LDL. Furthermore, triterpenoids such as oleanonic acid, pomolic acid, and pomonic acid were the major active compounds, and triterpenoids containing a carboxylic acid at C-28 play an important role in the inhibitory effect on foam cell formation in human macrophages. These data suggest that triterpenoids in Zizyphus jujuba , the plant source of ZF and ZS, may therefore be useful for the prevention of atherosclerosis.	zizyphus jujuba carboxylic acid
1	[Effect of powder's particle size on the quantitative prediction of volatile oil content in Zanthoxylum bungeagum by NIR technique].The traditional chemical methods to measure the volatile oil content of zanthoxylum bungeagum encounter some problems such as long time and low efficiency, so it is difficult to achieve rapid detection. One hundred forty-one samples including 74 zanthoxylum bungeagum maxim and 67 zanthoxylum schinifolium Sieb. et zucc were collected, from many provinces in China such as Shan Xi, Si Chuan, Gan Su, Chong Qing, Yun Nan, etc. Each sample was crushed and sorted to 8 kinds of powder samples according to the particle size of 120-mesh, 100-mesh, 80-mesh, 60-mesh, 40-mesh, 20-mesh, 10-mesh, respectively, including the material retained by the 10-mesh sieve. Then, each powder sample was labeled by one of the following serial numbers: 120, 100, 080, 060, 040, 020, 010 and 000. For each sample, the NIR spectra of 8 different kinds of particle size powders were measured using a Bruker MATRIX-I FT-NIR spectrometer. Then, the 8 different kinds of particle size powders of each sample were mixed uniformly. The volatile oil content was measured in each sample according to the distillation stipulated by the Forestry Standard of PRC-Quality Classify of Prickly Ash (LY/T 1652-2005). Based on near infrared spectroscopy technique and partial least squares (PLS), 8 calibration models of predicting volatile oil content were established by 141 powder samples with 8 different kinds of particle size. Experiments indicatd that the model was the best with the powder's particle size of 40-mesh and the determination coefficient (r2(141)) and the root mean square error of cross validation (RMSECV141) were 0.9364 and 0.421, respectively. The model was established by the calibration set with 105 samples with particle size of 40-mesh. Applying the model to the test set with 36 samples, the determination coefficient (r2(36)), the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP36), the relative standard deviation (RSD36), and the ratio of prediction to deviation (RPD36) were 0.9233, 0.452, 11.66%, and 3.624, respectively. The model, based on the same sample set but optimized by OPUS 5.0, was developed by spectral data pretreatment of the Mean Centering+Vector Normalization in the spectral region of 6 100.1-5 774.2 cm(-1) and 4 601.6-4 424.2 cm(-1). Using the model to predict the test set, r2(36), RMSEP36, RSD36, and RPD36 were 0.9862, 0.192, 4.95%, and 8.517, respectively. The results showed that the model built by samples passed through 40-mesh screen was the best and rapid detection of volatile oil content in zanthoxylum bungeagum by NIR was feasible and efficient.	zanthoxylum volatile oil
1	Validation of a high-performance liquid chromatography method for the determination of (-)-alpha-bisabolol from particulate systems.A reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography method has been developed and validated for determination and quantitation of the natural sesquiterpene (-)-alpha-bisabolol. Furthermore the application of the method was done by characterization of chitosan milispheres and liposomes entrapping Zanthoxylum tingoassuiba essential oil, which contains appreciable amount of (-)-alpha-bisabolol. A reversed-phase C(18) column and gradient elution was used with the mobile phase composed of (A) acetonitrile-water-phosphoric acid (19:80:1) and (B) acetonitrile. The eluent was pumped at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min with UV detection at 200 nm. In the range 0.02-0.64 mg/mL the assay showed good linearity (R(2 )= 0.9999) and specificity for successful identification and quantitation of (-)-alpha-bisabolol in the essential oil without interfering peaks. The method also showed good reproducibility, demonstrating inter-day and intra-day precision based on relative standard deviation values (up to 3.03%), accuracy (mean recovery of 100.69% +/- 1.05%) and low values of detection and quantitation limits (0.0005 and 0.0016 mg/mL, respectively). The method was also robust for showing a recovery of 98.81% under a change of solvent in standard solutions. The suitability of the method was demonstrated by the successful determination of association efficiency of the (-)-alpha-bisabolol in chitosan milispheres and liposomes.	zanthoxylum tingoassuiba acetonitrile
2	Tyrosinase inhibitor isolated from the leaves of Zanthoxylum piperitum.Two flavonols, quercetin (1) and quercitrin (2), were isolated from the leaves of Zanthoxylum piperitum. Their structures were established by UV, one- and two-dimensional NMR, and mass spectroscopic methods. Quercetin showed significant inhibition against mushroom tyrosinase with an IC50 value of 3.8 microg/ml, and appeared to inhibit the polyphenol oxidase activity of tyrosinase in a competitive manner (Ki = 10 +/- 0.20 microM) when L-tyrosine was used as a substrate, although it did not inhibit the melanin production of Streptomyces bikiniensis.	zanthoxylum piperitum Quercetin

1	Unified approach to catechin hetero-oligomers: first total synthesis of trimer EZ-EG-CA isolated from Ziziphus jujuba.A catechin hetero-trimer isolated from Ziziphus jujuba has been synthesized. Among three constituent monomers, (-)-epiafzelechin and (-)-epigallocatechin were prepared by de novo synthesis. Trimer formation relied on the unified approach to oligomers based on the bromo-capping and the orthogonal activation, reaching the reported structure of the natural product.	ziziphus jujuba (-)-epiafzelechin
1	In vitro activities of plant extracts on human Loa loa isolates and cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells.Loa loa, a filarial worm, can cause fatal encephalitis in humans. In an attempt to find alternatives to the standard treatments (ivermectin and diethylcarbamazine citrate), we tested 12 methanolic extracts of nine traditional plant remedies. The extracts (100-0.09 microg/ml) were incubated with 20 Loa loa microfilariae isolated from patients at 37 degrees C with 5% CO(2) in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal serum and antibiotics. Activity was evaluated 120 h later by counting live microfilariae under a microscope. Cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells was estimated by measuring 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2-5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide transformation to formazan at 450 nM in a spectrophotometer. The plants tested were Lophira alata, Greenwayodendron suaveolens, Uapaca togoensis, Zanthoxylum heitzii, Peperomia pellucida, Piptadeniastrum africanum, Petersianthus macrocarpus, Vernonia conferta, and Vernonia hymenolepis. Chemical screening showed that most of the extracts contained reducing sugars, tannin or polyphenols, sterols or triterpenes, saponosides, and alkaloids. None contained carotinoids and few contained flavonoids. The 50% lethal concentration ranged from 0.22 to 70.28 microg/ml, while the 50% inhibitory concentration for eukaryotic cells (IC(50)) ranged from 8.52 to 119.52 microg/ml. Extracts of P. macrocarpus (selectivity index = 72.16), P. africanum (13.69), Z. heitzii (12.11), and L. alata (9.26) were highly selective for L. loa.	l. alata flavonoids
1	UHPLC-TOFMS coupled with chemometric method as a powerful technique for rapid exploring of differentiating components between two Ziziphus species.To rapidly explore the differentiating components and the potential chemical markers for discrimination between those Chinese medicinal herbs with similar chemical characteristics, an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-TOFMS coupled with multivariate statistical analysis method was proposed and validated by using two Ziziphus species (Z. jujuba and Z. jujuba var. spinosa) as the model herbs. After the samples were analyzed using UHPLC-TOFMS, the data sets of retention time (RT)-m/z pairs, ion intensities and sample codes were further processed with orthogonal partial least squared discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) to holistically compare the difference between the fruits of these two Ziziphus species, and to generate an S-plot. Those compounds correlating to the points at the two ends of "S" were regarded as the most differentiating components between these two kinds of samples. By comparing the mass/UV spectra and retention times with those of reference compounds, these components were finally characterized as zizyberenalic acid, palmitoleic acid, oleic acid, pomonic acid and rutin, and these compounds would be the potential chemical markers for discrimination of these jujube products. The results suggested that this newly established approach could be used to rapidly determine the subtle differences and explore the potential chemical markers for differentiation within the herbs with similar chemical ingredients.	jujube spinosa
1	Acid-catalyzed esterification of Zanthoxylum bungeanum seed oil with high free fatty acids for biodiesel production.A technique to produce biodiesel from crude Zanthoxylum bungeanum seed oil (ZSO) with high free fatty acids (FFA) was developed. The acid value of ZSO was reduced to 1.16mg KOH/g from 45.51mg KOH/g by only one-step acid-catalyzed esterification with methanol-to-oil molar ratio 24:1, H(2)SO(4) 2%, temperature 60 degrees C and reaction time 80min, which was selected as optimum for the acid-catalyzed esterification. During the acid-catalyzed esterification, FFA was converted into fatty acid methyl esters, which was confirmed by (1)H NMR spectrum. Compared with the other two-step pretreatment procedure, this one-step pretreatment can reduce the production cost of ZSO biodiesel. Alkaline-catalyzed transesterification converted the pretreated ZSO into ZSO biodiesel. The yield of ZSO biodiesel was above 98% determined by (1)H NMR spectrum. This study supports the use of crude ZSO as a viable and valuable raw feedstock for biodiesel production.	zanthoxylum bungeanum FFA

Extracts of P. macrocarpus (selectivity index = 72.16), P. africanum (13.69), Z. heitzii (12.11), and L. alata (9.26) were highly selective for L. loa.	p. macrocarpus sterols
1	Development of flexible antimicrobial films using essential oils as active agents.The antimicrobial activity in the vapor-phase of laboratory-made flexible films of polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene/ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (PE/EVOH) incorporating essential oil of cinnamon ( Cinnamomum zeylanicum), oregano ( Origanum vulgare), clove ( Syzygium aromaticum), or cinnamon fortified with cinnamaldehyde was evaluated against a wide range of microorganisms: the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella choleraesuis; the Gram-positive bacteria Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Enterococcus faecalis; the molds Penicillium islandicum, Penicillium roqueforti, Penicillium nalgiovense, Eurotium repens, and A spergillus flavus and the yeasts Candida albicans, Debaryomyces hansenii, and Zigosaccharomyces rouxii. Films with a nominal concentration of 4% (w/w) of fortified cinnamon or oregano essential oil completely inhibited the growth of the fungi; higher concentrations were required to inhibit the Gram-positive bacteria (8 and 10%, respectively), and higher concentrations still were necessary to inhibit the Gram-negative bacteria. PP films were more effective than PE/EVOH films. The atmospheres generated by the antimicrobial films inside Petri dishes were quantitatively analyzed using headspace-single drop microextraction (HS-SDME) in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The analyses showed that the oregano-fortified PP films released higher levels of carvacrol and thymol, and the cinnamon-fortified PP films released higher levels of cinnamaldehyde, during the first 3-6 h of incubation, than the corresponding PE/EVOH films. Shelf-life tests were also performed, demonstrating that the antifungal activities of the films persisted for more than two months after their manufacture. In addition, migration tests (overall and specific) were performed, using both aqueous and fatty simulants, to ensure that the films meet EU regulations regarding food contact materials. Following contact with the tested films, the substances that had migrated into the aqueous simulants were recovered by direct immersion-single drop extraction (DI-SDME) and then analyzed by GC-MS. The fatty stimulant (isooctane) was directly injected into the chromatographic system.	cinnamon cinnamaldehyde
2	Secondary metabolites from the root wood of Zanthoxylum wutaiense and their antitubercular activity.Bioassay-guided fractionation of the root wood of Zanthoxylum wutaiense led to the isolation of five new compounds, wutaipyranol A (1), 8-methoxywutaipyranol A (2), demethoxywutaiensal (3), demethoxywutaiensol (4), and dihydrodemethoxywutaiensol (5), together with six known compounds. Their structures were elucidated by 1D- and 2D-NMR, as well as MS analyses. Among the isolates, wutaipyranol A (1), 8-methoxywutaipyranol A (2), and demethoxywutaiensal (3) exhibited antitubercular activities against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H(37) Rv in vitro, with MIC values of 52.4, 55.6, and 45.8 mug/ml, respectively.	zanthoxylum wutaiense 8-methoxywutaipyranol a
2	Anthelmintic screening of Zimbabwean plants traditionally used against schistosomiasis.Extracts of 23 plant species used popularly against schistosomiasis in Zimbabwe were screened for their anthelmintic effect. Schistosomules of the trematode Schistosoma mansoni and cysticercoids of the cestode Hymenolepis diminuta were studied in vitro. The material consisted of 58 plant extracts, of which 37 killed the newly excysted cysticercoids within an hour, when incubated in a culture medium. Lethal concentrations varied from 0.8 to 103 mg/ml. All plant extracts showed activity against the tapeworms after 24 h. Ten of the best extracts were also tested against schistosomules. Five of these extracts showed activity. Lethal concentrations varied from 0.6 to 33.8 mg/ml of dry plant material. Extracts of stem and root from Abrus precatorius (Fabaceae), of root bark and leaves from Ozoroa insignis (Anacardiaceae) and of root bark from Zizyphus mucronata (Rhamnaceae) gave the best results against tapeworms. The best results against schistosomules were obtained with stem and root extracts from Abrus precatorius (Fabaceae) and stem bark from Elephantorrhiza goetzei (Mimosaceae). Although the activity of root and root bark extracts commonly used in traditional medicine was verified in this study, our results showed that also extracts from leaf and stem can be effective anthelmintics.	abrus precatorius trematode schistosoma mansoni
1	Apoptosis inducing activity of benzophenanthridine-type alkaloids and 2-arylbenzofuran neolignans in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells.Thirteen compounds belonging to different classes of alkaloids (1-9) and lignans (10-13), isolated from the methanol extract of roots of the African medicinal plant Zanthoxylum capense, were assayed for their ability as apoptosis inducers in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells. The cytotoxicity of these compounds was evaluated in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells by the MTS assay. Out of the tested compounds, three benzophenanthridine alkaloids (1, 4, and 7), a dibenzyl butyrolactone lignan (10), and two 2-arylbenzofuran neolignans (12 and 13) displayed significant cytotoxicity to HCT116 cells, confirmed by the Guava ViaCount viability assay. The selected compounds (1, 4, 7, 10, 12, and 13) were further tested for apoptosis induction activity in HCT116 cells, by evaluation of nuclear morphology following Hoechst staining, and by caspase-3 like activity assays. Morphologic evaluation of HCT116 nuclei following Hoechst staining and fluorescence microscopy revealed that compounds 1, 4, 7, 10, 12, and 13 induced apoptosis in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells, producing similar, or higher, apoptosis levels when compared with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), the cornerstone cytotoxic used in colon cancer treatment for several decades. In fact, HCT116 cells developed morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis, including chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation and formation of apoptotic bodies. Importantly, compounds 4 and 13 at 20 muM were the most promising in this study, inducing respectively ~11- and 7-fold increases in apoptotic cells as compared to vehicle control, whereas 5-FU increased apoptosis by ~2-fold. Apoptosis induction for compounds 4 and 13 was further confirmed by caspase-3-like activity assays, which showed respectively ~2- and 1.5-fold increases in caspase-3-like activity compared to vehicle control. These results suggested that specific benzophenanthridine alkaloids and 2-arylbenzofuran neolignans isolated from Zanthoxylum capense show strong anticancer activity in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells.	zanthoxylum capense lignans
1	Isolation and Characterization of Sesquiterpenoids from Cassia Buds and Their Antimicrobial Activities.Cassia buds, the immature fruits of Cinnamomum cassia (Lauraceae), are widely consumed as a food spice, dietary supplements, flavoring agents, and preservatives. In this study, cassia buds were phytochemically investigated for the first time, leading to the isolation of 2 new sesquiterpenoids (1 and 2) and 10 known sesquiterpenoids (3-12). Their structures were determined by spectrometric and spectroscopic analyses, including nuclear magnetic resonance, high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, and circular dichroism. Cinnamosim A (1) represents the ninth example of the rare cyperane-type sesquiterpenoids. All of the compounds (1-12) isolated from cassia buds were evaluated for antimicrobial activities, with compounds 1-3, 5-8, 11, and 12 exhibiting strong antimicrobial activities against Candida albicans and compounds 6, 7, and 11 showing moderate antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The present investigation indicated that sesquiterpenoids from cassia buds might be used as potential antimicrobial agents to preserve food.	cinnamomum cassia sesquiterpenoids
1	Antibacterial and Antibiofilm Activities of Cinnamomum Sp. Essential Oil and Cinnamaldehyde: Antimicrobial Activities.To assess the activities of essential oils derived from the trunk bark of Cinnamomum zeylanicum (EOCz) and Cinnamomum cassia (EOCc) as well as cinnamaldehyde on bacterial biofilms of clinical interest. Antimicrobial activity was assessed by the broth microdilution method to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Antibiofilm activity was assessed by quantifying the biomass and determining the number of viable cells. The chemical composition of the essential oils was determined. The results showed that the major component of EOCz and EOCc was cinnamaldehyde. For the assayed substances, biofilm biomasses were reduced by up to 99.9%, and Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli biofilms were sensitive to all of the concentrations and substances analysed. In cell viability tests, 2 mg/ml of cinnamaldehyde reduced the number of viable cells by 5.74 Log CFU/ml. EOCz, EOCc, and cinnamaldehyde exhibited antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities. This work describes substances with potential use against infections caused by bacterial biofilms.	cinnamomum zeylanicum essential oils
1	Pharmacokinetics of daikenchuto, a traditional Japanese medicine (kampo) after single oral administration to healthy Japanese volunteers.The pharmacokinetics of daikenchuto (TJ-100), a pharmaceutical-grade traditional Japanese medicine, were investigated in healthy Japanese volunteers after a single oral administration of 2.5-, 5-, and 10-g doses. Six ingredients [hydroxy-alpha-sanshool (HAS), hydroxy-beta-sanshool (HBS), [6]-shogaol (6S), [10]-shogaol (10S), ginsenoside Rb1(GRB1), and ginsenoside Rg1(GRG1)] of TJ-100 were determined by using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The results indicated that HAS, an ingredient derived from Zanthoxylum piperitum fruit, exhibited the highest plasma concentration among the six ingredients investigated. The plasma concentrations of HAS, HBS, 6S, and 10S reached the maximum concentration (approximately 400, 80, 0.14, and 0.6 ng/ml, respectively, after a 5-g administration of TJ-100) within 30 min after administration, and the mean half-life was approximately 2 h. Thus, these compounds were rapidly absorbed and eliminated. The plasma concentration of GRB1 reached the maximum concentration (2 ng/ml after a 5-g administration of TJ-100) at approximately 4 h after administration and the half-life of GRB1 was approximately 40 h. The plasma concentration of GRG1 was extremely low (&lt;0.023 ng/ml). The pharmacokinetics of HAS, HBS, 6S, and 10S, were linear within the range of 2.5 to 10 g/day of TJ-100. On the other hand, the kinetics of GRB1 and GRG1 were not proportional to dosage, and plateauing was observed.	zanthoxylum piperitum ginsenoside
1	Authentication and quantitative analysis on the chemical profile of cassia bark (cortex cinnamomi) by high-pressure liquid chromatography.Cassia bark or cortex cinnamomi, the dried stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia Presl. (Lauraceae), is a popular natural spice and a commonly used herb in traditional Chinese medicine. However, adulterants are frequently found in the market. In this study, 44 samples of Cassia bark including bark from seven related Cinnamomum species were collected from fields and market. Four characteristic components, cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, and coumarin were determined by RP-HPLC, and a fingerprint comprised of five markers was established. These results showed that cassia barks contained high contents of cinnamaldehyde (13.01-56.93 mg/g). The highest content of cinnamaldehyde (up to 93.83 mg/g) was found in debarked cortex, which is traditionally regarded as having the best quality in local herb shops. In contrast, the adulterants from the other Cinnamomum species, C. wilsonii Camble, C. japonicum Sieb., C. mairei Levl. and C. burmanii (Nees) Blume, contained low contents of cinnamaldehyde (&lt;2.00 mg/g). The content of cinnamaldehyde in C. loureirii Nees was comparable to that in C. cassia. It is suggested that five characteristic peaks by HPLC are suitable for distinguishing genuine cassia bark from the adulterants and could be applied in the quality control of this commodity.	cassia bark cinnamaldehyde

0	Compounds from Sichuan and Melegueta peppers activate, covalently and non-covalently, TRPA1 and TRPV1 channels.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Oily extracts of Sichuan and Melegueta peppers evoke pungent sensations mediated by different alkylamides [mainly hydroxy-alpha-sanshool (alpha-SOH)] and hydroxyarylalkanones (6-shogaol and 6-paradol). We assessed how transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) and TRP vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), two chemosensory ion channels, participate in these pungent sensations. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The structure-activity relationships of these molecules on TRPA1 and TRPV1 was measured by testing natural and synthetic analogues using calcium and voltage imaging on dissociated dorsal root ganglia neurons and human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing the wild-type channels or specific cysteine mutants using glutathione trapping as a model to probe TRPA1 activation. In addition, using Trpv1 knockout mice, the compounds' aversive responses were measured in a taste brief-access test. KEY RESULTS: For TRPA1 activation, the cis C6 double bond in the polyenic chain of alpha-SOH was critical, whereas no structural specificity was required for activation of TRPV1. Both 6-shogaol and 6-paradol were found to activate TRPV1 and TRPA1 channels, whereas linalool, an abundant terpene in Sichuan pepper, activated TRPA1 but not TRPV1 channels. Alkylamides and 6-shogaol act on TRPA1 by covalent bonding whereas none of these compounds activated TRPV1 through such interactions. Finally, TRPV1 mutant mice retained sensitivity to 6-shogaol but were not responsive to alpha-SOH. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The pungent nature of components of Sichuan and Melegueta peppers was mediated via interactions with TRPA1 and TRPV1 channels and may explain the aversive properties of these compounds.	6-paradol TRPA1
2	Poisoning due to white seed variety of Abrus precatorius.We report an unusual case of poisoning involving the white seed variety of Abrus precatorius that caused serious manifestations in a middle-aged male who had consumed the seeds on the advice of a folk medicine practitioner. He recovered after a prolonged duration of hospital treatment without any subsequent complications or sequelae. The case is being reported on account of its rarity.	abrus precatorius poisoning
4	MAPK inhibitors and pifithrin-alpha block cinnamaldehyde-induced apoptosis in human PLC/PRF/5 cells.Cinnamaldehyde (Cin) has been shown to be effective in inducing apoptotic cell death in a number of human cancer cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of pifithrin-alpha (PFTalpha; a specific p53 inhibitor) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) inhibitors [namely SP600125 (a specific JNK inhibitor), SB203580 (a specific p38 inhibitor) and PD98059 (a specific ERK inhibitor)] on apoptotic signaling transduction mechanism induced by Cin in human hepatoma PLC/PRF/5 (CD95-negative) cells. Using XTT assay, Cin exhibited a powerful cytotoxic effect and apoptotic induction in PLC/PRF/5 cells. Apoptosis was elicited when cells were treated with 1 microM Cin as characterized by morphological changes and the appearance of phosphatidylserine on the outer surface of the plasma membrane. Cin down-regulated the expression of Bcl-(XL), up-regulated mutant p53 and Bax proteins and promoted caspase-3 to active forms, as well as cleaving poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in a time-dependent pattern. This could be supported by the activation and phosphorylation of MAPKs, including JNK, ERK and p38 kinases. Pre-incubation with PFTalpha and specific MAPK inhibitors significantly diminished the effect of Cin-induced apoptosis. The activities of anti-apoptotic (Bcl-(XL)) and pro-apoptotic (Bax) proteins were remarkably affected by PFTalpha and PD98059 pre-treatment. PFTalpha effectively blocked PARP cleavage in cells treated with Cin, and also markedly prevented the phosphorylation of JNK, p38 and ERK proteins. These results suggest that p53 induction and MAPK signaling pathways are required for Cin-mediated apoptosis in PLC/PRF/5 cells.	Bcl-(XL) cancer
1	Application of near-infrared spectroscopy in quality control and determination of adulteration of African essential oils.An evaluation has been made of the potential of near-infrared (NIR) technologies in the assessment of essential oil components and in the identification of individual essential oils. The results showed that cross-validation models are able to predict accurately almost all of the components of essential oils. In different cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum) and clove (Syzygium aromaticum) essential oils, which showed a similar composition, 23 components (representing 97.8-99.9% of the oil) were accurately predicted, as well as 20 components (93.0-99.1%) in Cinnamomum camphora (ravintsara), 32 components (92.3-98.1%) in Ravensara aromatica (ravensara), and 26 components (96.6-98.4%) in Lippia multiflora. For almost all of the components, the modelled and reference values obtained by GC-FID were highly correlated (r2 &gt; or = 0.985) and exhibited a low variance (less than 5%). The model was also able to discriminate between the ravintsara and ravensara essential oils. It was shown that two commercial oils labelled as R. aromatica were actually ravintsara (C. camphora), revealing the misidentification of these essential oils in the marketplace. The study demonstrates the application of NIR technology as a quality control tool for the rapid identification of individual essential oils, for product authentication, and for the detection of adulteration.	cinnamomum zeylanicum essential oils
1	Chemical composition and antibacterial activities of the essential oil from Abies koreana.The essential oils from an alpine needle leaf of Abies koreana, which is a species native to Korea, was obtained by hydrodistillation with 0.9% (v/w) yield and analysed by GC and GC-MS. Sixty-eight constituents, accounting for more than 95.9% of the total oil composition, were identified. The main compounds with concentrations higher than 3% were borneol (27.9%), alpha-pinene (23.2%), beta-pinene (5.8%), terpinene-4-ol (3.8%), bornyl acetate (3.4%) and alpha-terpineol (3.1%). The antibacterial activity of the oil was evaluated against nine microorganisms using disc diffusion and broth microdilution methods. The essential oil exhibited some broad spectrum antibacterial activity against the tested organisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.	abies koreana borneol
2	In vitro anti-Helicobacter pylori action of 30 Chinese herbal medicines used to treat ulcer diseases.Infection by Helicobacter pylori has been ascertained to be an important etiologic impetus leading usually to chronic active gastritis and gastric ulcer with growing incidences worldwide. Utilizing as the test pathogen a standard and five clinic strains of Helicobacter pylori, the antibacterial action was assessed in vitro with ethanol extracts of 30 Chinese herbal medicines which have been frequently prescribed since ancient times for treating gastritis-like disorders. Among the 30 tested materials, the ethanol extracts of Abrus cantoniensis (Fabaceae), Saussurea lappa (Asteraceae) and Eugenia caryophyllata (Myrtaceae) were strongly inhibitory to all test strains (MICs: approximately 40 microg/ml), and Hippophae rhamnoides (Elaeagnaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii (Liliaceae), Magnolia officinalis and Schisandra chinensis (Magnoliaceae), Corydalis yanhusuo (Papaveraceae), Citrus reticulata (Rutaceae), Bupleurum chinense and Ligusticum chuanxiong (Apiaceae) substantially active with MICs close to 60.0 microg/ml. As to antibacterial actions of the aqueous extracts of the same drugs, those derived from Cassia obtusifolia (Fabaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii and Eugenia caryophyllata were remarkably inhibitory against all the six Helicobacter pylori strains (MICs: approximately 60 microg/ml). The work compared almost quantitatively the magnitude of the anti-Helicobacter pylori actions of the 30 most prescribed gastritis-treating Chinese herbal drugs, and located as well some source plants where potent anti-Helicobacter pylori phytochemicals could be characterized.	fritillaria thunbergii gastric ulcer
2	Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology of Ziziphus jujuba Mills.Ziziphus jujuba Mills, 'annab' in Iran, 'ber' in India or 'pomme sourette' in France, is a species whose fruit (known warmly as 'the fruits of life' in China) has been consumed for centuries for its nutritional value. The food industry used it as a food additive and flavoring. The dry seeds, the crude leaves and the stem bark are still used in ethnopharmacology to treat digestive disorders and gastric ulcers as antitussive, laxative and hypotensive drugs; even now, it is used in China to treat children who suffer from typhoid fever, furuncle and ecthyma. In Taiwan, the dry seeds for the variety spinosa (Suan Zao Ren) are the second most commonly prescribed and used phytomedicine for insomnia. Its popularity and production have increased worldwide in recent years, especially in Europe. The European Pharmacopoeia Commission has been unable to elaborate upon the EP monograph on Ziziphi spinosae semen as was planned. The EMA has not made its recommendations yet. Is it still a gap in the scientific knowledge? Or is difficult for traditional Chinese medicinal herbs to fulfill the style and quality parameters that are required?

1	Development and characterization of immobilized cannabinoid receptor (CB1/CB2) open tubular column for on-line screening.Cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, are therapeutic targets in the treatment of anxiety, obesity, movement disorders, glaucoma, and pain. We have developed an on-line screening method for CB1 and CB2 ligands, where cellular membrane fragments of a chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line, KU-812, were immobilized onto the surface of an open tubular (OT) capillary to create a CB1/CB2-OT column. The binding activities of the immobilized CB1/CB2 receptors were established using frontal affinity chromatographic techniques. This is the first report that confirms the presence of functional CB1 and CB2 receptors on KU-812 cells. The data from this study confirm that the CB1/CB2-OT column can be used to determine the binding affinities (K(i) values) for a single compound and to screen individual compounds or a mixture of multiple compounds. The CB1/CB2-OT column was also used to screen a botanical matrix, Zanthoxylum clava-herculis, where preliminary results suggest the presence of a high-affinity phytocannabinoid.	zanthoxylum clava-herculis phytocannabinoid
1	The Effect of Plant Additives on the Stability of Polyphenols in Dried Black Chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa) Fruit.Chokeberry fruit exhibits a high level of pro-health potential, associated with a significant amount of polyphenol content and antioxidant activity. The fruit is easily perishable and therefore needs to be processed in short order to ensure its availability throughout the year. For this purpose, the fruit is dried, which has an impact on the preservation of bioactive components such as polyphenols. In the study, chokeberry fruit was influenced by a suspension of spices, including clove and cinnamon, and subsequently dried using the freeze-drying, convection, and microwave radiation methods. Freeze-drying was concluded to be the most desirable method of drying, which preserves the largest amount of polyphenols while soaking fruit in a suspension of cinnamon or cloves accelerated the loss of anthocyanins during the storage period. The obtained test results may constitute a valuable source of information for manufacturers in designing new products with increased pro-health potential, whose properties result from the high content of polyphenols and other plant additives.	cinnamon polyphenols

3	Hypoglycemic activities of A- and B-type procyanidin oligomer-rich extracts from different Cinnamon barks.Procyanidin oligomers in Cinnamon are thought to be responsible for the biological activity in the treatment of diabetes mellitus (DM). To clarify types of procyanidin oligomers in different Cinnamon species and investigate their different effects, the present study investigated procyanidin oligomers in polyphenolic oligomer-rich extracts of three Cinnamon samples by LC-MS methods, and their hypoglycemic activities were detected in vivo and in vitro. The results showed that two of the three samples from Cinnamomum cassia were rich in B-type procyanidin oligomers, and the other sample was rich in A-type procyanidin oligomers. The Cinnamon extracts were administered at doses of 200 and 300 mg/kg body wt. in high-fat diet-fed and low-dose streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice for 14 days. The results showed that blood glucose concentrations were significantly decreased in all Cinnamon extract groups compared with the control group (p&lt;0.05). Administration of the Cinnamon extracts significantly increased the consumption of extracellular glucose in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells and normal HepG2 cells compared with the control group. These results suggest that both A- and B-type procyanidin oligomers in different Cinnamon species have hypoglycemic activities and may improve insulin sensitivity in type 2 DM.	procyanidin DM
1	[Studies on the chemical constituents from the peel of Zanthoxylum schinifolium Sieb et Zucc].Five compounds have been isolated from the Chinese traditional drug Qinghuajiao (Zanthoxylum schinifolium Sieb et Zucc). On the basis of UV, IR, 1HNMR, 13CNMR, 1H-1H COSY, 1H-13C COSY, NOESY and MS spectroscopic analysis, four of them have been identified as bergarpten (I), umbelliferone (II), skimmianine (III) and schinifoline (IV) respectively. The compounds II, III and IV were obtained for the first time from Zanthoxylum schinifolium, and the last one is a new compound.	zanthoxylum schinifolium skimmianine

1	Fatty acids and carotenes in some ber (Ziziphus jujuba Mill) varieties.Several jujube varieties from the southeast of Spain were analyzed for fatty acid and carotene contents. Triglycerides having medium-chain fatty acids were most abundant in all samples. The main fatty acids were 12:0 (18.3 +/- 9.97), 10:0 (12.5 +/- 19.0), 18:2n6 (9.27 +/- 7.26), 16:1n7 (8.50 +/- 5.77), 16:0 (7.25 +/- 4.35), and 18:1n9 (5.34 +/- 2.52) on total saponifiable oil. The fruits yield 1.33 +/- 0.17 g/100 g saponifiable oil on a dry weight basis. Fatty acid profiles of fruits were found to be influenced by their developmental stage. Multivariable data analyses show that the samples could be grouped on the basis of their fatty acid content. Carotenes were found to be in good agreement with other fruits, varying from 4.12 to 5.98 mg/100 g on a dry weight basis. The contribution to vitamin value reach a mdium of 38 microg RE/100 g on a fresh weight basis.	jujube Carotenes
3	Total flavones of abelmoschus manihot enhances angiogenic ability both in vitro and in vivo.Angiogenesis is a process of new blood vessel formation from pre-existing vessels. It is a normal and vital process in growth and development, as well as in wound healing and in the formation of granulation tissue. Total flavones of Abelmoschus manihot (TFA) are the major constituents of the traditional Chinese herb Abelmoschus manihot L. Medic. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of TFA on angiogenic ability using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro and chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) in vivo. HUVECs were treated with TFA at different concentrations. Cell viability, cell cycle progression, cell apoptosis, cell migration and tubular formation were investigated. The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and kinase insert domain receptor (KDR, VEGFR-2) was examined by immunohistochemistry to identify mechanism of action of TFA. CAM model was used to evaluate the effect of TFA on angiogenesis in vivo. Our results showed that TFA promoted HUVECs proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. It increased HUVECs migratory ability and the number of tubular structure, promoted vessel formation in HUVECs culture and CAM model. Furthermore, TFA treatment resulted in a decrease in cell apoptosis and enhanced the expression of VEGF and KDR. Taken together, TFA, as the major active component isolated from the traditional Chinese herb Abelmoschus manihot L. Medic, could enhance angiogenic ability of HUVECs in vitro and CAM in vivo. TFA may be used in the treatment of wound healing and ischemic/reperfusion injuries.	flavones ischemic
1	Simultaneous analysis of alkaloids from Zanthoxylum nitidum by high performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry.The chemical profiles of nine alkaloids in Zanthoxylum nitidum, including berberubine, coptisine, sanguinarine, nitidine, chelerythrine, liriodenine, 6,7,8-trimethoxy-2,3-methylendioxybenzophenantridine, oxyavicine and dihydrochelerythrine, were identified by using high performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS), and a novel and sensitive HPLC-UV method had been developed to simultaneously determine these alkaloids in 70% methanol extract of Zanthoxylum nitidum. The chromatographic separation was performed on an Agilent C(18) analytical column (5 microm, 4.6 mm i.d., 250 mm length) with a gradient solvent system of acetonitrile-0.1% formic buffer (adjusted to pH 4.5 with triethylamine). The methodological validation was carried out and the linearities (r(2)&gt;0.9997) and recoveries (ranged from 98.3% to 101.1%) were acceptable. The limits of detection (LOD) of these alkaloids were ranged from 0.6 ng to 1.5 ng. The results indicated that the contents of alkaloids in Zanthoxylum nitidum varied significantly from habitat to habitat with contents ranged from 0.03 mg/g to 3.34 mg/g. The proposed method is simple, effective and suitable for the quality control of this traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). It suggests that it is necessary to control its quality so as to insure efficacy and safety of TCM.	zanthoxylum nitidum alkaloids
2	Agrimonia pilosa Ledeb., Cinnamomum cassia Blume, and Lonicera japonica Thunb. protect against cognitive dysfunction and energy and glucose dysregulation by reducing neuroinflammation and hippocampal insulin resistance in beta-amyloid-infused rats.OBJECTIVES: The water extracts of Cinnamomum cassia Blume bark (CCB; Lauraceae), Lonicera japonica Thunb. flower (LJT; Caprifoliaceae), and Agrimonia pilosa Ledeb. leaves (APL; Rosaceae) prevented amyloid-beta (25-35)-induced cell death in PC12 cells in our preliminary study. We evaluated whether long-term oral consumption of CCB, LJT, and APL improves cognitive dysfunction and glucose homeostasis in rats with experimentally induced AD-type dementia. METHODS: Male rats received hippocampal CA1 infusions of amyloid-beta (25-35, AD) or amyloid-beta (35-25, non-plaque forming, normal-controls, Non-AD-CON), at a rate of 3.6 nmol/day for 14 days. AD rats were divided into four groups receiving either 2% lyophilized water extracts of CCB, LJT, or APL or 2% dextrin (AD-CON) in high-fat diets (43% energy as fat). RESULTS: Hippocampal amyloid-beta deposition, tau phosphorylation, and expressions of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (neruoinflammation markers) were increased, and insulin signaling decreased in AD-CON. CCB, LJT, and APL all prevented hippocampal amyloid-beta accumulation and enhanced hippocampal insulin signaling. CCB, LJT, and APL decreased TNF-alpha and iNOS in the hippocampus and especially APL exhibited the greatest decrease. AD-CON exhibited cognitive dysfunction in passive avoidance and water maze tests, whereas CCB, LJT, and APL protected against cognitive dysfunction, and APL was most effective and was similar to Non-AD-CON. AD-CON had less fat oxidation as an energy fuel, but it was reversed by CCB, LJT, and especially APL. APL-treated rats had less visceral fat than AD-CON rats. AD-CON rats exhibited impaired insulin sensitivity and increased insulin secretion during oral glucose tolerance test compared with Non-AD-CON, but CCB and APL prevented the impairment. DISCUSSION: These results supported that APL, LJT, and CCB effectively prevent the cognitive dysfunction and the impairment of energy and glucose homeostasis induced by amyloid-beta deposition by reducing neuroinflammation and enhancing insulin signaling. APL exhibited the greatest effectiveness for improving cognitive function.	lonicera japonica thunb cognitive dysfunction
4	p73 induction by Abrus agglutinin facilitates Snail ubiquitination to inhibit epithelial to mesenchymal transition in oral cancer.BACKGROUND: Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a key step in oral cancer progression, is associated with invasion, metastasis, and therapy resistance, thus targeting the EMT represents a critical therapeutic strategy for the treatment of oral cancer metastasis. Our previous study showed that Abrus agglutinin (AGG), a plant lectin, induces both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis to activate the tumor inhibitory mechanism. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the role of AGG in modulating invasiveness and stemness through EMT inhibition for the development of antineoplastic agents against oral cancer. METHODS: The EMT- and stemness-related proteins were studied in oral cancer cells using Western blot analysis and fluorescence microscopy. The potential mechanisms of Snail downregulation through p73 activation in FaDu cells were evaluated using Western blot analysis, immunoprecipitation, confocal microscopy, and molecular docking analysis. Immunohistochemical staining of the tumor samples of AGG-treated FaDu-xenografted nude mice was performed. RESULTS: At the molecular level, AGG-induced p73 suppressed Snail expression, leading to EMT inhibition in FaDu cells. Notably, AGG promoted the translocation of Snail from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in FaDu cells and triggered its degradation through ubiquitination. In this setting, AGG inhibited the interaction between Snail and p73 in FaDu cells, resulting in p73 activation and EMT inhibition. Moreover, in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated FaDu cells, AGG abolished the upregulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 that plays a pivotal role in the upregulation of Snail to regulate the EMT phenotypes. In immunohistochemistry analysis, FaDu xenografts from AGG-treated mice showed decreased expression of Snail, SOX2, and vimentin and increased expression of p73 and E-cadherin compared with the control group, confirming EMT inhibition as part of its anticancer efficacy against oral cancer. CONCLUSION: In summary, AGG stimulates p73 in restricting EGF-induced EMT, invasiveness, and stemness by inhibiting the ERK/Snail pathway to facilitate the development of alternative therapeutics for oral cancer.	p73 oral cancer

1	Constituents of the root wood of Zanthoxylum wutaiense with antitubercular activity.Bioassay-guided fractionation of the root wood of Zanthoxylum wutaiense led to the isolation of 11 new compounds, wutaiensol methyl ether (1), demethoxywutaiensol methyl ether (2), methyl wutaiensate (3), methyl 7-hydroxyanodendroate (4), methyl 7-methoxyanodendroate (5), wutaifuranol (6), 7-methoxywutaifuranol (7), 7-methoxywutaifuranal (8), methyl wutaifuranate (9), methyl 7-methoxybenzofuran-5-carboxylate (10), and wutaipyranol (12), together with another 37 known compounds, of which one, 7-methoxybenzofuran-5-carboxaldehyde (11), was not previously known as a plant constituent. The structures of these isolates were identified by means of spectroscopic analysis. Five of these isolates were found to be antitubercular constituents, namely, methyl 7-methoxyanodendroate (5), 7-methoxywutaifuranal (8), wutaiensal (13), dictamnine (14), and gamma-fagarine (15), which exhibited antitubercular activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, showing MIC values of 35, 35, 30, 30, and 30 microg/mL, respectively.	zanthoxylum wutaiense 7-methoxywutaifuranal
3	Isobutylhydroxyamides from the pericarp of Nepalese Zanthoxylum armatum inhibit NF1-defective tumor cell line growth.A neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-based bioassay-guided phytochemical investigation on Zanthoxylum armatum collected in Nepal led to the isolation of new timuramides A-D (1-4) and six known sanshools (5-10). The structures of all compounds were established by using modern spectroscopic techniques, including 1D and 2D NMR analysis and comparison with previously reported data. Most of the compounds inhibited growth of an Nf1- and p53-deficient mouse glioma cell line at noncytotoxic concentrations.	Isobutylhydroxyamides neurofibromatosis
4	Differential antiproliferation effect of 2'-benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde in K-ras-transformed cells via downregulation of thiol antioxidants.2'-Benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde (BCA), one of the derivatives of 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (HCA) isolated from the bark of Cinnamomum cassia, induces apoptosis in human cancer cells. We found that BCA induces stronger antiproliferative effects in K-ras-transformed cells (RK3E-ras) than in isogenic non-transformed cells (RK3E). Treatment of RK3E-ras with BCA resulted in increased ROS generation and depletion of intracellular glutathione, whereas BCA-treated RK3E showed no significant increase in the ROS level with concurrent increase in intracellular glutathione (GSH). Thiol antioxidants recovered cell proliferation inhibition caused by BCA in both cell lines, while non-thiol antioxidants failed to recover cell death. BCA decreased metallothionein (MT) expression in RK3E-ras, while inducing remarkable MT expression in RK3E. The increase of intracellular GSH in RK3E is partially caused by differential induction of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS) due to BCA treatment. To evaluate the upstream pathway for differential expression of gamma-GCS and MT, we analyzed early DJ-1 (PARK7) and NF-E2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) changes after BCA treatment. In RK3E, DJ-1 expression considerably increased for 3 h with concurrent induction of Nrf2, whereas in RK3E-ras cells BCA decreased these protein levels. Based on these findings, it seems that the therapeutic selectivity of BCA in RK3E-ras results from decreased thiol antioxidants via decreased DJ-1 and Nrf2 expression.	PARK7 cancer
4	Hydroxy-alpha-sanshool activates TRPV1 and TRPA1 in sensory neurons.Sanshools are major active ingredients of Zanthoxylum piperitum and are used as food additives in East Asia. Sanshools cause irritant, tingling and sometimes paresthetic sensations on the tongue. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the pungent or tingling sensation induced by sanshools is not known. Because many transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are responsible for the sensations induced by various spices and food additives, we expressed 17 TRP channels in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells and investigated their activation by hydroxy-alpha-sanshool (HalphaSS) or hydroxy-beta-sanshool (HbetaSS) isolated from Zanthoxylum piperitum. It was found that HalphaSS, but not HbetaSS, depolarized sensory neurons with concomitant firing of action potentials and evoked inward currents. Among 17 TRP channels expressed in HEK cells, HalphaSS caused Ca(2+) influx in cells transfected with TRPV1 or TRPA1, and evoked robust inward currents in cells transfected with TRPV1 or TRPA1. In primary cultured sensory neurons, HalphaSS induced inward currents and Ca(2+) influx in a capsazepine-dependent manner. Moreover, HalphaSS-induced currents and Ca(2+) influx were greatly diminished in TRPV1(-/-) mice. HalphaSS evoked licking behavior when injected into a single hind paw of wild-type mice, but this was much reduced in TRPV1-deficient mice. These results indicate that TRPV1 and TRPA1 are molecular targets of HalphaSS in sensory neurons. We conclude that the activations of TRPV1 and TRPA1 by HalphaSS explain its unique pungent, tingling sensation.	TRPV1 sensations
2	Secondary metabolites from the root wood of Zanthoxylum wutaiense and their antitubercular activity.Bioassay-guided fractionation of the root wood of Zanthoxylum wutaiense led to the isolation of five new compounds, wutaipyranol A (1), 8-methoxywutaipyranol A (2), demethoxywutaiensal (3), demethoxywutaiensol (4), and dihydrodemethoxywutaiensol (5), together with six known compounds. Their structures were elucidated by 1D- and 2D-NMR, as well as MS analyses. Among the isolates, wutaipyranol A (1), 8-methoxywutaipyranol A (2), and demethoxywutaiensal (3) exhibited antitubercular activities against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H(37) Rv in vitro, with MIC values of 52.4, 55.6, and 45.8 mug/ml, respectively.	zanthoxylum wutaiense dihydrodemethoxywutaiensol
1	The Use of Essential Oils and Their Isolated Compounds for the Treatment of Oral Candidiasis: A Literature Review.In this literature review, we present the main scientific findings on the antifungal activity of essential oils (EOs) applicable for a new drug formulation to treat oral candidiasis. Seven literature databases were systematically searched for eligible in vitro and clinical trials. Selected articles were screened for biological activity, botanical species, phytochemical composition, study design, and methodological quality. A total of 26 articles were included in the review, of which 21 were in vitro studies and 5 clinical trials. The most promising EOs were obtained from Allium tubeorosum, Cinnamomum cassia, Cinnamomum zeylanicum, and Coriandrum sativum L. Among the phytochemicals, citral and thymol were the most active. Clinical trials indicated that the EOs from Pelargonium graveolens and Zataria multiflora are potentially effective to treat oral candidiasis.

3	Total flavone of Abelmoschus manihot ameliorates Crohn's disease by regulating the NF-kappaB and MAPK signaling pathways.Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic relapsing form of inflammatory bowel disease, and its pathogenesis remains unknown. Total flavone of Abelmoschus manihot L. Medic (TFA), has been used as anti-inflammatory and myocardial ischemia protective drug. The present study aimed to explore the effects of TFA on CD and its underlying mechanism. We reported that TFA comprises eight flavone glycosides, including quercetin-3-O-robinobioside, gossypetin-3-O-glucoside, quercetin-3'-O-glucoside, isoquercetin, hyperoside, myricetin, gossypetin and quercetin. In vivo, TFA promoted the survival of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in mice, decreased weight loss and increased colon length in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, TFA notably ameliorated the inflammatory response in mice with TNBS-induced colitis as determined by histopathological analysis. In addition, the administration of TFA in mice with TNBS-induced colitis led to a significant decrease in the levels of cytokines in the sera and colon tissues; a significant decrease myeloperoxidase activity in the colon tissues was also observed. These findings may be associated with the suppression of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. In vitro, TFA significantly downregulated the expression of cytokines in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 cells. In addition, TFA suppressed LPS-induced activation of the NF-kappaB and MAPK signaling pathways in RAW264.7 cells. Our findings indicated that TFA could suppress the inflammatory response in mice with TNBS-induced colitis via inhibition of the NF-kappaB and MAPK signaling pathways. The results of the present study may improve understanding of the function of TFA and provide a novel theoretical basis for the treatment of CD.	flavone crohn's disease

3	Pretreatment with the total flavone glycosides of Flos Abelmoschus manihot and hyperoside prevents glomerular podocyte apoptosis in streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy.Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is an important diabetic complication, and podocyte apoptosis plays a critical role in the development of DN. In the present study, we examined the preventive effect of the total flavone glycosides of Flos Abelmoschus manihot (TFA) on urinary microalbumin and glomerular podocyte apoptosis in experimental DN rats. The preliminary oral administration of TFA (200 mg/kg/day) for 24 weeks significantly decreased the urinary microalbumin to creatinine ratio and 24-h urinary total protein in streptozotocin-induced DN rats. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling assay indicated glomerular cell apoptosis in DN rats was significantly improved by pretreatment with TFA. Furthermore, fluorescence-activated cell sorting and Hoechst 33342 staining suggested preincubation with hyperoside (50 and 200 mug/mL), the major active constituent of TFA, could significantly mitigate cultured podocyte apoptosis induced by the advanced glycation end-products (AGEs). Western blot analysis showed that increased caspase-3 and caspase-8 expressions induced by AGEs were also inhibited by pretreatment with hyperoside at both doses. Our results demonstrate that TFA pretreatment can decrease urinary albumin excretion in early-stage DN, which might be accomplished by preventing renal damage and podocyte apoptosis.	flavone glycosides renal damage
3	Miscellaneous terpenoid constituents of Abies nephrolepis and their moderate cytotoxic activities.Three monoterpenoids and two triterpenoids were isolated from Abies nephrolepis together with 53 known terpenoids. The structures of the compounds were established by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. The absolute configuration of 3-hydroxycamphane-2-carboxylic acid was established as (1S,2R,3S,4R) by Cu-Kalpha X-ray crystallography. All 58 isolates were tested for cytotoxic activity against four tumor cells viz. A549 (human lung adenocarcinoma), Colo205 (colon adenocarcinoma), QGY-7703 (human hepatoma) and THP-1 (human monocytic leukemia). alpha-Cadinol exhibited the best effects on A549, Colo205 and QGY-7703 with IC(50) values of 8.6, 8.1 and 4.6 mug/mL, respectively.	alpha-Cadinol lung adenocarcinoma
1	Structural characterization of polysaccharides from Zizyphus jujuba and evaluation of antioxidant activity.Fruit of Zizyphus jujuba Mill, a traditional Chinese herb widely consumed in Asian countries, has been reported to possess several vital biological activities. This study intends to develop an appropriate analytical method for isolation of polysaccharides from Z. jujuba fruits and evaluate their antioxidant activity. Initially, powdered Z. jujuba fruits were subjected to hot water extraction, followed by ethanol precipitation, deproteination, dialysis and fractionation in a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column. One neutral polysaccharide fraction (ZJPN) and 3 acidic polysaccharide fractions (ZJPa1, ZJPa2 and ZJPa3) were isolated with the average MW ranging from 40,566 to 129,518 Da. GC analysis revealed that 6 monosaccharides, namely, rhamnose, arabinose, xylose, mannose, glucose and galactose were present in polysaccharide fractions. The galacturonic acid content in polysaccharide fractions followed the order: ZJPa3&gt;ZJPa2&gt;ZJPa1&gt;ZJPN. All the 4 polysaccharide fractions were found to be more effective in scavenging superoxide anions than hydroxyl radicals, while acidic polysaccharides showed a more pronounced effect in chelating ferrous ion.	z. jujuba mannose
4	Differential antiproliferation effect of 2'-benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde in K-ras-transformed cells via downregulation of thiol antioxidants.2'-Benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde (BCA), one of the derivatives of 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (HCA) isolated from the bark of Cinnamomum cassia, induces apoptosis in human cancer cells. We found that BCA induces stronger antiproliferative effects in K-ras-transformed cells (RK3E-ras) than in isogenic non-transformed cells (RK3E). Treatment of RK3E-ras with BCA resulted in increased ROS generation and depletion of intracellular glutathione, whereas BCA-treated RK3E showed no significant increase in the ROS level with concurrent increase in intracellular glutathione (GSH). Thiol antioxidants recovered cell proliferation inhibition caused by BCA in both cell lines, while non-thiol antioxidants failed to recover cell death. BCA decreased metallothionein (MT) expression in RK3E-ras, while inducing remarkable MT expression in RK3E. The increase of intracellular GSH in RK3E is partially caused by differential induction of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS) due to BCA treatment. To evaluate the upstream pathway for differential expression of gamma-GCS and MT, we analyzed early DJ-1 (PARK7) and NF-E2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) changes after BCA treatment. In RK3E, DJ-1 expression considerably increased for 3 h with concurrent induction of Nrf2, whereas in RK3E-ras cells BCA decreased these protein levels. Based on these findings, it seems that the therapeutic selectivity of BCA in RK3E-ras results from decreased thiol antioxidants via decreased DJ-1 and Nrf2 expression.	Nrf2 cancer
2	Large-scale and effective screening of Korean medicinal plants for inhibitory activity on matrix metalloproteinase-9.Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) degrades type IV collagen constituting the major structural component of the basement membrane and extra cellular membrane. The enzymatic activity is found to be elevated in tumor tissues. With the aim of finding novel MMP-9 inhibitors from natural products, 87 extracts of oriental medicinal herbs, which are used as prescriptions for cancer treatment in traditional Korean medicine, were screened for their inhibitory activities towards MMP-9. It was found that most of the hexane and chloroform fractions as well as water extracts showed a weak inhibitory effect on MMP-9 activity at a concentration of 100mug/ml. However, a strong inhibition was found in the butanol fractions of Cinnamomum cassia PRESL, Magnolia obovata THUEB., Magnolia officinalis REHD. et WILS., Magnolia officinalis REHD. et WILS. var. biloba REHD. et WILS., and Euonymus alatus (THUNB.) SIEB. with inhibitory activity (&gt;90%) at a concentration of 100 microg/ml.	euonymus alatus cancer
1	Zantholic acid, a new monoterpenoid from Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides.From the extract of Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides fruits, a new menthane monoterpenoid, (4R,7R)-8-carboxy-7,9-dihydroxy-trans-menthane, tentatively, named as zantholic acid along with several known compounds was isolated. Its structure was determined using spectroscopic methods. The cytotoxic activity of zantholic acid against a panel of cancer cell lines was evaluated using the MTT assay. The results show that zantholic acid possesses a selective cytotoxic activity towards breast cancer cell lines. 	zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides zantholic acid
2	Cinnamomum cassia Presl: A Review of Its Traditional Uses, Phytochemistry, Pharmacology and Toxicology.Cinnamomum cassia Presl is a tropical aromatic evergreen tree of the Lauraceae family, commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine. It is also a traditional spice, widely used around the world. This paper summarizes the achievements of modern research on C. cassia, including the traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacology and toxicology. In addition, this review also discusses some significant issues and the potential direction of future C. cassia research. More than 160 chemicals have been separated and identified from C. cassia. The main constituents of C. cassia are terpenoids, phenylpropanoids, glycosides, etc. Modern studies have confirmed that C. cassia has a wide range of pharmacological effects, including antitumour, anti-inflammatory and analgesic, anti-diabetic and anti-obesity, antibacterial and antiviral, cardiovascular protective, cytoprotective, neuroprotective, immunoregulatory effects, anti-tyrosinase activity and other effects. However, the modern studies of C. cassia are still not complete and more in-depth investigations need to be conducted in alimentotherapy, health product, toxicity and side effects, and more bioactive components and potential pharmacological effects need to be explored in the future.	c. cassia obesity
4	Development and characterization of immobilized cannabinoid receptor (CB1/CB2) open tubular column for on-line screening.Cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, are therapeutic targets in the treatment of anxiety, obesity, movement disorders, glaucoma, and pain. We have developed an on-line screening method for CB1 and CB2 ligands, where cellular membrane fragments of a chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line, KU-812, were immobilized onto the surface of an open tubular (OT) capillary to create a CB1/CB2-OT column. The binding activities of the immobilized CB1/CB2 receptors were established using frontal affinity chromatographic techniques. This is the first report that confirms the presence of functional CB1 and CB2 receptors on KU-812 cells. The data from this study confirm that the CB1/CB2-OT column can be used to determine the binding affinities (K(i) values) for a single compound and to screen individual compounds or a mixture of multiple compounds. The CB1/CB2-OT column was also used to screen a botanical matrix, Zanthoxylum clava-herculis, where preliminary results suggest the presence of a high-affinity phytocannabinoid.

2	Anti-Oxidant and Hepatoprotective Activities of Ziziphus mucronata Fruit Extract Against Dimethoate-Induced Toxicity.OBJECTIVE: The study was carried out to evaluate the hepatoprotective and antioxidant potential of Ziziphus mucronata (ZM) fruit extract. METHODS: The different types of fruit extract were prepared by soaking the dry powdered fruit in different solvents followed by rotary evaporation. Each extract was tested for its phenol content and antioxidant activities. An in vivo study was performed in Sprague- Dawley (SD) rats. Thirty adult male SD rats (aged 21 weeks) were divided into six groups of five rats each and treated as follows: The normal control (NC) received distilled water while the dimethoate control (DC) received 6 mg/kg.bw.day-1 dimethoate dissolved in distilled water. The experimental groups E1, E2, E3, and E0 received dimethoate (6 mg/kg.bw) + ZMFM (100 mg/kg.bw-1), dimethoate (6 mg/kg.bw) + ZMFM (200 mg/kg.bw-1), dimethoate (6 mg/kg.bw) + ZMFM (300 mg/kg.bw-1), and ZMFM (300 mg/kg.bw-1) only. Both the normal control and the dimethoate control groups were used to compare the results. After 90 days, rats were sacrificed, blood was collected for biochemical assays, and livers were harvested for histological study. RESULTS: High phenol content was estimated, and 2, 2- diphenyl-1-picryl hydrazyl radical (DPPH) spectrophotometric, thin layer chromatography (TLC) and 2, 2-Azobis-3-ethyl benzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) assays showed a high antioxidant activity among the extracts. The preventive effects observed in the E1, E2 and E3 groups proved that the extract could prevent dimethoate toxicity by maintaining normal reduced glutathione (GSH), vitamin C and E, superoxide dismutase, catalase, cholineasterase and lipid profiles. The preventive effect was observed to be dose dependent. The EO group showed no extractinduced toxicity. Histological observations agreed with the results obtained in the biochemical studies. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated that ZM methanol fruit extract is capable of attenuating dimethoate-induced toxicity because of its high antioxidant activity.	ziziphus mucronata toxicity
1	2'-Hydroxycinnamaldehyde targets low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 to inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced microglial activation.2'-Hydroxycinnamaldehyde (HCA) isolated from the stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia and its derivative 2'-benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde (BCA) were reported to have anti-angiogenic, anti-proliferative, and anti-inflammatory effects in several human cancer cells and RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. However, effects of HCA/BCA on the neuroinflammation have not been investigated. In the present study, a potential anti-neuroinflammatory effect of HCA/BCA was assessed in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated microglial cultures and microglia/neuroblastoma cocultures. Nitric oxide production, inflammatory gene expression, and signaling pathways were investigated. HCA/BCA significantly decreased the production of nitric oxide and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in microglial cells. HCA/BCA also attenuated the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and TNF-alpha at mRNA level via blockade of ERK, JNK, p38 MAPK, and NF-kappaB activation. Moreover, HCA/BCA was neuroprotective by reducing microglia-mediated neuroblastoma cell death in a microglia-neuroblastoma co-culture. Affinity chromatography and LC-MS/MS analysis identified low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) as a potential molecular target of HCA in microglial cells. Based on the studies using the receptor-associated protein (RAP) that blocks a ligand binding to LRP1 and the siRNA-mediated LRP1 gene silencing, we were able to conclude that HCA inhibited LPS-induced microglial activation via LRP1. Our results suggest that HCA/BCA be anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective in the CNS by targeting LRP1, and may have a therapeutic potential against neuroinflammatory diseases.	cinnamomum cassia BCA
1	Fumigant activity of plant essential oils and components from Schizonepeta tenuifolia against Lycoriella ingenua (Diptera: Sciaridae).Plant essential oils from 21 plant species were tested for their insecticidal activities against larvae of Lycoriella ingenua Dufour (Diptera: Sciaridae) by using a fumigation bioassay. Good insecticidal activity against larvae of L. ingenua was achieved with essential oils of Acorus gramineus Solander, Schizonepeta tenuifolia Briquet, and Zanthoxylum piperitum De Candolle at 25 microg/ml air. S. tenuifolia oil showed the most potent insecticidal activity among the plant essential oils. At 12.5 microg/ml air concentration, S. tenuifolia oil caused 96.6% mortality, but mortality decreased to 60% at 3.125 microg/ml air. Analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry led to identification of three major compounds from S. tenuifolia oil. These three compounds were tested individually for their insecticidal activities against larvae of L. ingenua and compared with the toxicity of dichlorvos. Pulegone was the most toxic, followed by menthone and limonene with LC50 values of 1.21, 6.03, and 15.42 microg/ml, respectively. LC50 of dichlorvos was 8.13 microg/ml. Effects of S. tenuifolia and its components on growth of Pleurotus ostreatus (Jacq. ex Fr.) Kummer also were investigated.	s. tenuifolia essential oils

Their structures were fully characterized by spectroscopic analyses in combination with chemical derivatization. Compounds 1-3, and 6 were evaluated for their antiviral activity against the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). Compounds 2, 3, and 6 showed potent inhibitory effects on PEDV replication. 	ziziphus jujuba daechuine
1	Total flavones of Abelmoschus manihot improve diabetic nephropathy by inhibiting the iRhom2/TACE signalling pathway activity in rats.CONTEXT: Total flavones extracted from Abelmoschus manihot L. (Malvaceae) medic (TFA) have been proven clinically effective at improving renal inflammation and glomerular injury in chronic kidney disease (CKD). OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the function of TFA as an inhibitor of iRhom2/TACE (tumour necrosis factor-alpha converting enzyme) signalling and investigated its anti-DN (diabetic nephropathy) effects in a DN rat model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vitro, cells were treated with 200 mug/mL advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and then co-cultured with 20 mug/mL TFA for 24 h. Real time PCR, western blotting and co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed. In vivo, DN was induced in 8 week old male Sprague-Dawley rats via unilateral nephrectomy and intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin, then TFA were administered to rats by gavage for 12 weeks at three different doses (300, 135 and 75 mg/kg/d). 4-Phenylbutanoic acid (2.5 mg/kg/d) was used as a positive control. RESULTS: IC50 of TFA is 35.6 muM in HK2 and 39.6 muM in HRMC. TFA treatment (20 muM) inhibited the activation of iRhom2/TACE signalling in cultured cells induced by AGEs. LD50&gt;26 g/kg and ED50=67 mg/kg of TFA in rat by gavage, TFA dose-dependently downregulated the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and exerted anti-inflammatory effects significantly though inhibiting the activation of iRhom2/TACE signalling. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that TFA could dose-dependently ameliorate renal inflammation by inhibiting the activation of iRhom2/TACE signalling and attenuating ER stress. These results suggest that TFA has potential therapeutic value for the treatment of DN in humans.	abelmoschus manihot flavones
2	Identification of three competitive inhibitors for membrane-associated, Mg2+-dependent and neutral 60 kDa sphingomyelinase activity.Methanol extracts of domestic plants of Korea were evaluated as a potential inhibitor of neutral pH optimum and membrane-associated 60 kDa sphingomyelinase (N-SMase) activity. In this study, we partially purified N-SMase from bovine brain membranes using ammonium sulfate. It was purified approximately 163-fold by the sequential use of DE52, Butyl-Toyopearl, DEAE-Cellulose, and Phenyl-5PW column chromatographies. The purified N-SMase activity was assayed in the presence of the plant extracts of three hundreds species. Based on the in vitro assay, three plant extracts significantly inhibited the N-SMase activity in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. To further examine the inhibitory pattern, a Dixon plot was constructed for each of the plant extracts. The extracts of Abies nephrolepis, Acer tegmentosum, and Ginkgo biloba revealed a competitive inhibition with the inhibition constant (Ki) of 11.9 microg/ mL, 9.4 microg/mL, and 12.9 microg/mL, respectively. These extracts also inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the production of ceramide induced by serum deprivation in human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y.	acer tegmentosum neuroblastoma
1	Production of Abrus pulchellus ribosome-inactivating protein from seeds callus culture.Ribosome inactivating proteins (RIPs) were isolated from callus culture that were established from seed explants of Abrus pulchellus. Cotyledon segments of immature seeds were inoculated in basal medium MS supplemented with different concentrations of auxin (2,4-D), citokinin (kinetin and BA) and sucrose in order to determine the best callus induction. A. pulchellus type 2 RIP (pulchellin) expression was monitored in callus cultures by RT-PCR and biological activity. The calli obtained after 35 days were freeze dried, macerated and submitted to extraction of total RNA and proteins (0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.6 buffer, containing 0.15 M NaCl, 3 h at room temperature). A specific DNA fragment codifying the A-chain pulchellin was amplified from callus RNA suggesting the presence of the protein. This was confirmed in the calli crude extract that showed haemagglutinating activity against rabbit blood cells and a high intraperitoneal toxicity to mice. The crude extract was also submitted to affinity chromatography on a Sepharose-4B column. The retained protein, peak released by 0.1 M galactose, appeared to be composed of two main bands in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, in denaturating conditions, with a similar pattern to that obtained with seeds.	a. sativum diallyl tri- and disulfide
1	Variability of phenolic and alkaloid content in different plant parts of Carissa edulis Vahl and Zanthoxylum chalybeum Engl.OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to investigate the relative abundance and effect of post-harvest treatment on total phenolics (TP) and total alkaloids in the leaves and bark of Carissa edulis and Zanthoxylum chalybeum, which would give an indication of the suitability of leaves as alternative sources of medicine in these plant species. RESULTS: Results indicated higher levels of total phenolics than total alkaloids in both of the species under both freezing and air drying conditions. While more alkaloids were found in leaves compared to bark, there was no difference in abundance of phenols between the plant parts of both species. Air drying preserved more TPs than freezing and the opposite was true for alkaloids. For sustainability, leaves are recommended as an alternative source of medicine instead of the preferred root or stem bark. However, the choice of whether to dry or freeze will depend on the specific compound of interest. Assessment of spatial variability of medicinal properties is highly recommended.	zanthoxylum chalybeum phenols
1	Protective effects of cinnamic acid and cinnamic aldehyde on isoproterenol-induced acute myocardial ischemia in rats.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Cinnamomum cassia is a well-known traditional Chinese herb that is widely used for the treatment of ischemic heart disease (IHD). It has favorable effects, but its mechanism is not clear. To investigate the effects of cinnamic aldehyde (CA) and cinnamic acid (CD) isolated from Cinnamomum cassia against myocardial ischemia produced in rats by isoproterenol (ISO). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized equally to nine groups: a control group, an untreated model group, CA (22.5, 45, 90 mg/kg) or CD (37.5, 75, 150 mg/kg) treatment, or propranolol (30 mg/kg). Rats were treated for 14 days and then given ISO, 4 mg/kg for 2 consecutive days by subcutaneous injection. ST-segment elevation was measured after the last administration. Serum levels of creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), nitric oxide (NO), and blood rheology were measured after the rats were sacrificed. The hearts were excised for determining heart weight index, microscopic examination, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) measurements. RESULTS: CA and CD decreased the ST elevation induced by acute myocardial ischemia, decreased serum levels of CK-MB, LDH, TNF-alpha and IL-6, and increased serum NO activity. CA and CD increased SOD activity and decreased MDA content in myocardial tissue. CONCLUSION: CA and CD were cardioprotective in a rat model of ischemic myocardial injury. The protection was attributable to anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, as well as increased NO. The results support further study of CA and CD as potential treatments for ischemic heart disease.	cinnamomum cassia cinnamic acid

1	Composition of essential oils from seeds of Abies koreana.The essential oils from seeds of nine Abies koreana specimens have been studied using GC-MS-FID and NMR methods, leading to the determination of 96 volatiles, which constituted over 99% of the oils. The hydrodistilled oils of fresh, resinous scent were isolated with yields in the range of 3.8-8.5%. The results showed that the essential oil of Korean fir seeds contained 70-95% monoterpenes and 1-20% oxygenated monoterpenes as the dominant groups. The numerous sesquiterpenes, diterpenes and their oxygenated derivatives constituted only 2-8% of the oil. The major component of the seed essential oil was limonene (41-72 g/100g); the laevorotary form of this terpene predominated. A. koreana seeds seem to be a rich source of both essential oil and (-)-limonene, whose average enantiomeric excess was above 95%.	a. koreana sesquiterpenes
3	A case of abrin toxin poisoning, confirmed via quantitation of L-abrine (N-methyl-L-tryptophan) biomarker.INTRODUCTION: The seeds of Abrus precatorius contain the highly toxic plant protein abrin. There is no antidote for abrin poisoning. Management, largely supportive, may consist of administering intravenous fluids, anti-emetics, and activated charcoal depending on the time of exposure. We report the presentation of a single case of unintentional abrin poisoning confirmed by the quantitation of L-abrine biomarker. CASE REPORT: A previously healthy 22-month-old, 11.5-kg female presented to the hospital after ingesting approximately 20 rosary peas (A. precatorius) sold as a "peace bracelet". Her primary manifestations were episodes of forceful emesis that included food particles progressing to clear gastric fluid. The patient was tachycardic (HR = 134 bpm) but had brisk capillary refill and normal blood pressure (96/60 mmHg). Laboratory testing revealed elevated blood urea nitrogen (16 mg/dL) and serum creatinine (0.4 mg/dL). In the emergency department, the patient was resuscitated with 40 mL/kg normal saline via peripheral IV and received ondansetron (0.15 mg/kg IV) to control retching. The patient was discharged well 24 h after the ingestion. DISCUSSION: This is the first case of human abrin toxin poisoning confirmed by the quantitation of L-abrine as a biomarker. Quantifying the levels of abrin toxin in the body after exposure can help clinicians make informed decisions when managing patients with symptomatic exposures to seeds of A. precatorius.

1	Comparison on the fatty acid profiles of liver, subcutaneous fat and muscle from feedlot steers finished on diets supplemented with or without cinnamaldehyde or monensin.BACKGROUND: Cinnamaldehyde (CIN) is the main active component of cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia) oil and has been tested as alternative feed additive in cattle production. Little information was available on the effect of dietary CIN in comparison to monensin (MO) on beef fatty acid (FA) profile. This study analyzed FA profiles of liver, subcutaneous fat and pars costalis diaphragmatis (PCD) muscle obtained from steers (n = 70) finished on diets: control, a barley grain-silage feedlot diet; 330 mg/head.day MO; and 400, 800 or 1600 mg/head.day CIN treatments. RESULTS: Inclusion of MO or CIN did not affect total saturated, unsaturated, polyunsaturated FA and individual FA in the various tissues with exceptions that proportion of palmitic acid in PCD muscle was increased by 800 mg/steer.day CIN (P &lt; 0.05). There were positive correlations (P &lt; 0.05) on oleic, linoleic, conjugated linoleic acid (CLA)-c9,t11 and 18:1-t10 between the subcutaneous fat and PCD muscle, and on alpha-linolenic acid, CLA-c9,t11 and 18:1-t10 between PCD muscle and liver, whereas correlations on the FA between the subcutaneous fat and liver were not significant except for 18:1-t10 (P &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the supplementation of CIN and MO to feedlot diet has limited effect on beef FA profiles.	cinnamomum cassia Cinnamaldehyde
2	Characterization and evaluation of bioactive polyphenolic constituents from Zanthoxylum armatum DC., a traditionally used plant.Zanthoxylum armatum or Timoor has been used in different traditional system of medicine due to its aromatic properties and also in the treatment of cancer, diarrhea and cholera. In the present investigation, four chemically distinct compounds namely Tambulin (6), Prudomestin (7), Ombuin (8) and 3, 4, 5, 3', 4', 5'-hexahydroxydiphenyl ether (9) have been isolated and quantified from the fruits. To explore the biological activities, we have further studied the antiproliferative, antimicrobial and antioxidant efficacy. Tambulin which was also found in maximum amount (0.125%) in fruits revealed significant antiproliferative activity (IC50 37.96+-0.36 to 48.7+-0.21mug/mL) against breast, liver, colon and skin cancer cell lines corroborated by resilient binding interaction with SDH (-6.76Kcal/mol) and inhibition constant (Ki: 11.02muM). Hexane and ethyl acetate fraction exhibited moderate antibacterial efficacy (MIC: 250-1000mug/mL) against selected pathogenic microbes while Ombuin displayed broad spectrum antibacterial effect with MIC ranges from 125 to 500mug/mL. Total phenolic content (5.27+-0.06 to 46.12+-0.40mg/g of gallic acid equivalents), total flavonoids content (6.05+-0.24 to 14.46+-0.73mg/g of quercetin equivalents), ferric reducing power (42.35+-0.85 to 62.52+-0.66mg/g of ferrous sulfate equivalents) and percent free radical scavenging activity (59.56+-0.38 to 64.85+-1.78) were also estimated. Our findings infer that Tambulin exhibited significant antiproliferative activity whereas Ombuin was found to display broad spectrum antibacterial activity which adds one more positive attribute to its traditional usage.	zanthoxylum armatum skin cancer

1	Components and insecticidal activity against the maize weevils of Zanthoxylum schinifolium fruits and leaves.In our screening program for new agrochemicals from Chinese medicinal herbs and wild plants, Zanthoxylum schinifolium essential oils were found to possess strong insecticidal activity against the maize weevil Sitophilus zeamais. The essential oils of Z. schinifolium fruits and leaves were extracted via hydrodistillation and investigated by GC and GC-MS. Estragole (69.52%) was the major compound of the essential oil of fresh fruits, followed by linalool (8.63%) and limonene (4.34%) and 94.33% of the total components were monoterpenoids. The main components of the essential oil of fresh leaves were linalool (12.94%), ar-tumerone (8.95%), limonene (6.45%) and elixene (5.43%) and only 50.62% were monoterpenoids. However, the essential oil from purchased fruits contained linalool (33.42%), limonene (13.66%) and sabinene (5.72%), followed by estragole (4.67%), nerol (4.56%) and 4-terpineol (4.27%). Estragole, linalool and sabinene were separated and purified by silica gel column chromatography and preparative thin layer chromatography, and further identified by means of physicochemical and spectrometric analysis. The essential oil from the fresh fruits (LD50 = 15.93 mug/adult) possessed two times more toxicity to the insects compared with that of fresh leaves (LD50 = 35.31 mug/adult). Estragole, linalool and sabinene exhibited contact activity against S. zeamais with LD50 values of 17.63, 13.90 and 23.98 mug/adult, respectively. The essential oils of Z. schinifolium possessed strong fumigant toxicity against S. zeamais adults with LC50 values of 13.19 mg/L (fresh fruits), 24.04 mg/L (fresh leaves) and 17.63 mg/L (purchased fruits). Estragole, linalool and sabinene also exhibited strong fumigant toxicity against the maize weevils with LC50 values of 14.10, 10.46 and 9.12 mg/L, respectively.	z. schinifolium sabinene
1	Antibacterial benzofuran neolignans and benzophenanthridine alkaloids from the roots of Zanthoxylum capense.Two new 2-arylbenzofuran neolignans and a new benzophenanthridine alkaloid, together with six known benzophenanthridine alkaloids, namely, decarine, norchelerythrine, dihydrochelerythrine, 6-acetonyldihydrochelerythrine, tridecanonchelerythrine, and 6-acetonyldihydronitidine, have been isolated from the MeOH extract of the roots of Zanthoxylum capense. Their structures were elucidated by means of spectroscopic techniques including 2D NMR experiments. All the isolated compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Some compounds showed significant inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 with MIC values ranging from 12.5 to 50 mug/mL.	zanthoxylum capense decarine
2	Tyrosinase inhibitory components from the seeds of Cassia tora.Ten compounds (1-10) isolated from the seeds of Cassia tora were evaluated for tyrosinase inhibition. Compounds 3, 4, and 7 inhibited tyrosinase enzymatic activity in a dose-dependent manner, with IC50 values of 3.0 +- 0.8, 7.0 +- 0.4, and 9.2 +- 3.4 muM, respectively. Kinetic analyses revealed a mechanism consistent with competitive inhibition. In silico molecular docking showed that compounds 3 and 4 docked in the active site of tyrosinase, whereas 7 interacted with Ala246 and Val248 at outside of the active site, and His244 and Glu256 at inside. Additionally, compounds 3, 4, and 7 suppressed melanogenesis in alpha-MSH-treated B16F10 melanoma cells at a concentration of 10 muM.	cassia tora melanoma
2	Plants used to treat epilepsy by Tanzanian traditional healers.A cross-sectional study performed in Temeke District (Dar es Salaam, Tanzania) showed that 5.5% of the traditional healers have knowledge for the treatment of epilepsy. Of the 100 healers interviewed, 30 (30%) believed that epilepsy was caused by witchcraft, while 19 (19%) thought epilepsy has a genetic origin which can be inherited. Other healers thought epilepsy can be caused by head injury or malaria (24%), and the remaining 27% did not know the cause. Most of the healers (92%) could present an accurate account on the symptoms of the disease, including dizziness, loss of consciousness, abrupt falling down, frothing from the mouth, loss of memory, biting of the tongue, confusion, and restlessness. They showed competence in the treatment of the disease, whereby 60 plants that are commonly used were mentioned. Abrus precatorius L. (Leguminosae), Clausena anisata (Willd.) Oliv. (Rutaceae) and Hoslundia opposita Vahl (Lamiaceae), which are among the plants mentioned, have proven anticonvulsant activity, while a few other species on their list have been reported to be useful in the treatment of epilepsy. Biological testing of these plants, using different models of convulsions is, suggested.	hoslundia opposita vahl epilepsy
1	Metabolism of hibifolin by human intestinal bacteria.Hibifolin, the highest-content bioactive flavonoid of the flowers of Abelmoschus manihot, was incubated with human intestinal bacteria, and four metabolites (1-4) were obtained from the incubated solution by chromatographic methods. The structures of the four metabolites were elucidated as gossypetin 8-O-beta-D-4''-deoxy- Delta(4'')-glucuropyranoside (1), gossypetin (2), quercetin (3), and 8-methoxy-quercetin (4), respectively, on the basis of UV, NMR, and MS data. Metabolite 1 was obtained as a new compound with a specific beta-D-4''-deoxy-Delta(4'')-glucuropyranosyl moiety, which was formed through a unique and novel metabolic pathway that has not been reported previously.	abelmoschus manihot gossypetin
1	Evaluation of the quality of Chinese and Vietnamese cassia using LC-MS and multivariate analysis.In the present study, the chemical composition of water extracts of Chinese and Vietnamese cassia (Cinnamomum cassia) were compared using multivariate analysis of LC-MS data. By principal component analysis of the LC-MS data, 6 compounds, cinnzeylanine (1), cinnzeylanol (2), anhydrocinnzeylanol (3), cinncasinol A (4), epicatechin (5) and procyanidin B2 (6), were identified as the marker compounds to characterize Chinese and Vietnamese cassia. It was clarified that Chinese cassia contains relatively larger amounts of epicatechin and procyanidin B2. On the other hand, Vietnamese cassia is characterized by a relatively larger amount of diterpenes. As catechin derivatives and diterpenes have different types of activity, it is important to choose the cassia that best suits the product for which it is to be used, whether in food or in herbal medicine.	cinnamomum cassia diterpenes
2	Rapid screening of bioactive components from Zingiber cassumunar using elution-extrusion counter-current chromatography.Elution-extrusion counter-current chromatography (EECCC) takes full advantages of the liquid nature of the stationary phase. It effectively extends the solute hydrophobicity window that can be studied and renders the CCC technique particularly suitable for rapid analysis of complex samples. In this paper, EECCC was used to screen the crude ethanol extract of Zingiber cassumunar and to isolate milligram-amounts of bioactive components. The two column volume (2V(C)) EECCC method was applied to rapidly optimize the composition of the biphasic liquid system in both reversed- and normal-phase separation mode. With the n-hexane/ethyl acetate/methanol/water 1/1/1/1 (v/v) system, 100mg of crude Z. cassumunar extract were fractionated on a 140 mL-capacity semi-preparative hydrodynamic CCC column and 0.5 g on a 1600 mL column for large-scale preparation. Satisfactory separation efficiency was achieved in both cases, producing milligram-amounts of four phenylbutenoids over 90% pure and of a mixture of diastereoisomers (phenylbutenoid dimers). However, the global throughputs of the two columns were 8 and 11 mg/h, not very different. This is due to the fact that the 1600 mL column could not retain the liquid stationary phase as well as the smaller 140 mL column. It was necessary to work at much lower flow rate than calculated. Methanol was added as a post-column clarifying reagent for stable continuous UV detection. A lipophilic biphasic liquid system composed of n-hexane/acetonitrile/water (5/3/2, v/v) allowed to resolve the pair of diastereoisomers with the larger preparative instrument producing 35 mg of the (+/-)-trans form 99.1% pure and 28 mg of the (+/-)-cis isomer 98.1% pure. Compared with classical elution, the EECCC approach exhibits strong separation efficiency and great potential to be a high-throughput separation technique in the case of complex samples.	z. cassumunar phenylbutenoid
1	Chemical composition and antibacterial activity of the essential oil from green huajiao (Zanthoxylum schinifolium) against selected foodborne pathogens.Green huajiao, which is the ripe pericarp of the fruit of Zanthoxylum schinifolium Sieb. et Zucc, is widely consumed in Asia as a spice. In this work, the chemical composition of the essential oil from green huajiao was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) and GC/mass spectrometry (MS), and the majority of components were identified. Linalool (28.2%), limonene (13.2%), and sabinene (12.1%) were found to be the major components. The antibacterial activity, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the essential oil were evaluated against selected bacteria, including food-borne pathogens. The results showed that the sensitivities to the essential oil were different for different bacteria tested, and the susceptibility of Gram-positive bacteria tested was observed to be greater than that of Gram-negative bacteria. The antibacterial activity of the essential oil was particularly strong against Staphylococcus epidermidis , with MIC and MBC values of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/mL, respectively. A postcontact effect assay also confirmed the essential oil had a significant effect on the growth rate of surviving S. epidermidis . The antibacterial activity of the essential oil from green huajiao may be due to the increase in permeability of cell membranes, and the leakage of intracellular constituents, on the basis of the cell constituents' release assay and electron microscopy observations. 	zanthoxylum schinifolium essential oil
1	Zizimauritic acids A-C, three novel nortriterpenes from Ziziphus mauritiana.Zizimauritic acids A-C (1-3), three novel nortriterpenes with a unique A-nor-E-seco spiro-lactone ceanothane-type triterpene skeleton, together with 3 known triterpenes ceanothenic acid (4), betulinic acid (5), and ceanothic acid (6), were isolated from the roots of Ziziphus mauritiana. Compounds 1-4 showed cytotoxicities with the IC(50) values ranging from 5.05 to 11.94 mug/ml, and compounds 1 and 3 showed an inhibitory effect on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus with the IC(50) values 2.17 and 12.79 mug/ml. A plausible biosynthetic pathway of compounds 1-3 was proposed.	ziziphus mauritiana zizimauritic acids a-c
2	The cinnamon-derived dietary factor cinnamic aldehyde activates the Nrf2-dependent antioxidant response in human epithelial colon cells.Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of tumor-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. Recent research suggests that pharmacological intervention using dietary factors that activate the redox sensitive Nrf2/Keap1-ARE signaling pathway may represent a promising strategy for chemoprevention of human cancer including CRC. In our search for dietary Nrf2 activators with potential chemopreventive activity targeting CRC, we have focused our studies on trans-cinnamic aldehyde (cinnamaldeyde, CA), the key flavor compound in cinnamon essential oil. Here we demonstrate that CA and an ethanolic extract (CE) prepared from Cinnamomum cassia bark, standardized for CA content by GC-MS analysis, display equipotent activity as inducers of Nrf2 transcriptional activity. In human colon cancer cells (HCT116, HT29) and non-immortalized primary fetal colon cells (FHC), CA- and CE-treatment upregulated cellular protein levels of Nrf2 and established Nrf2 targets involved in the antioxidant response including heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and gamma-glutamyl-cysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS, catalytic subunit). CA- and CE-pretreatment strongly upregulated cellular glutathione levels and protected HCT116 cells against hydrogen peroxide-induced genotoxicity and arsenic-induced oxidative insult. Taken together our data demonstrate that the cinnamon-derived food factor CA is a potent activator of the Nrf2-orchestrated antioxidant response in cultured human epithelial colon cells. CA may therefore represent an underappreciated chemopreventive dietary factor targeting colorectal carcinogenesis.	cinnamomum cassia colorectal carcinogenesis
2	From type 2 diabetes to antioxidant activity: a systematic review of the safety and efficacy of common and cassia cinnamon bark.Common (Cinnamomum verum, C. zeylanicum) and cassia (C. aromaticum) cinnamon have a long history of use as spices and flavouring agents. A number of pharmacological and clinical effects have been observed with their use. The objective of this study was to systematically review the scientific literature for preclinical and clinical evidence of safety, efficacy, and pharmacological activity of common and cassia cinnamon. Using the principles of evidence-based practice, we searched 9 electronic databases and compiled data according to the grade of evidence found. One pharmacological study on antioxidant activity and 7 clinical studies on various medical conditions were reported in the scientific literature including type 2 diabetes (3), Helicobacter pylori infection (1), activation of olfactory cortex of the brain (1), oral candidiasis in HIV (1), and chronic salmonellosis (1). Two of 3 randomized clinical trials on type 2 diabetes provided strong scientific evidence that cassia cinnamon demonstrates a therapeutic effect in reducing fasting blood glucose by 10.3%-29%; the third clinical trial did not observe this effect. Cassia cinnamon, however, did not have an effect at lowering glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c). One randomized clinical trial reported that cassia cinnamon lowered total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides; the other 2 trials, however, did not observe this effect. There was good scientific evidence that a species of cinnamon was not effective at eradicating H. pylori infection. Common cinnamon showed weak to very weak evidence of efficacy in treating oral candidiasis in HIV patients and chronic salmonellosis.	cinnamon chronic salmonellosis
1	Encapsulation of plai oil/2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin inclusion complexes in polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) electrospun nanofibers for topical application.The aim of this study was to prepare electrospun polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)/2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPbetaCD) nanofiber mats and to incorporate plai oil (Zingiber Cassumunar Roxb.). The plai oil with 10, 20 and 30% wt to polymer were incorporated in the PVP/HPbetaCD solution and electrospun to obtain nanofibers. The morphology and structure of the PVP and PVP/HPbetaCD nanofiber mats with and without the plai oil were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The thermal behaviors of the nanofiber mats were characterized using differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). Terpinen-4-ol was used as a marker of the plai oil. The amount of plai oil remaining in the PVP/HPbetaCD nanofiber mats was determined using gas chromatography-mass spectoscopy (GC-MS). The SEM images revealed that all of the fibers were smooth. The average diameter of fibers was 212-450 nm, and decreased with the increasing of plai oil content. The release characteristics of plai oil from the fiber showed the fast release followed by a sustained release over the experimental time of 24 h. The release rate ranged was in the order of 10% &gt; 20% ~ 30% plai oil within 24 h. Electrospun fibers with 20% plai oil loading provided the controlled release and also showed the highest plai oil content. Hence, this electrospun nanofiber has a potential for use as an alternative topical application.	zingiber cassumunar roxb plai oil
2	Screening of some Tanzanian medicinal plants for their trypanocidal and cytotoxic activities.The objective of the present study was to evaluate in vitro antitrypanosomal and cytotoxic activities of crude extracts of 20 traditionally used medicinal plants of Tanzania. A total of 40 extracts (dichloromethane and methanol) were screened for antiproliferative activity of bloodstream form of T. b. brucei and human leukaemia HL-60 cell. Inhibition of cell proliferation was assessed using resazurin as vital stain. Of the 40 extracts tested, the dichloromethane extract from bark of Warburgia salutaris (Canellaceae) exhibited the most potent antitrypanosomal activity with an IC(50) value of 10.68 microg/ml. A dichloromethane extract from Lannea stuhlmannii (Anacardiaceae) was found to be the most cytotoxic extract against HL-60 (IC(50) = 27.15 microg/ml). Out of the 20 plants tested, 5 plants exhibited trypanocidal activity with IC(50) values below 20 microg/ml. These 5 plants: Entandrophragma bussei (Meliaceae), Securidaca longepedunculata (Polygalaceae), Warburgia salutaris (Canellaceae), Zanha africana (Sapindaceae) and Zanthoxylum chalybeum (Rutaceae) could therefore serve as sources of lead compounds for treatment of trypanosomiasis.	securidaca longepedunculata trypanosomiasis
3	Differential antiproliferation effect of 2'-benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde in K-ras-transformed cells via downregulation of thiol antioxidants.2'-Benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde (BCA), one of the derivatives of 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (HCA) isolated from the bark of Cinnamomum cassia, induces apoptosis in human cancer cells. We found that BCA induces stronger antiproliferative effects in K-ras-transformed cells (RK3E-ras) than in isogenic non-transformed cells (RK3E). Treatment of RK3E-ras with BCA resulted in increased ROS generation and depletion of intracellular glutathione, whereas BCA-treated RK3E showed no significant increase in the ROS level with concurrent increase in intracellular glutathione (GSH). Thiol antioxidants recovered cell proliferation inhibition caused by BCA in both cell lines, while non-thiol antioxidants failed to recover cell death. BCA decreased metallothionein (MT) expression in RK3E-ras, while inducing remarkable MT expression in RK3E. The increase of intracellular GSH in RK3E is partially caused by differential induction of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS) due to BCA treatment. To evaluate the upstream pathway for differential expression of gamma-GCS and MT, we analyzed early DJ-1 (PARK7) and NF-E2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) changes after BCA treatment. In RK3E, DJ-1 expression considerably increased for 3 h with concurrent induction of Nrf2, whereas in RK3E-ras cells BCA decreased these protein levels. Based on these findings, it seems that the therapeutic selectivity of BCA in RK3E-ras results from decreased thiol antioxidants via decreased DJ-1 and Nrf2 expression.	HCA cancer
1	Unified approach to catechin hetero-oligomers: first total synthesis of trimer EZ-EG-CA isolated from Ziziphus jujuba.A catechin hetero-trimer isolated from Ziziphus jujuba has been synthesized. Among three constituent monomers, (-)-epiafzelechin and (-)-epigallocatechin were prepared by de novo synthesis. Trimer formation relied on the unified approach to oligomers based on the bromo-capping and the orthogonal activation, reaching the reported structure of the natural product.	ziziphus jujuba (-)-epigallocatechin
2	Antiurolithiatic activity of Abelmoschus moschatus seed extracts against zinc disc implantation-induced urolithiasis in rats.BACKGROUND: The commonly used techniques for removing renal calculi are associated with the risk of acute renal injury and increase in stone recurrence which indicates an urgent need for alternate therapy. OBJECTIVES: The aim was to evaluate the antiurolithiatic activity of Abelmoschus moschatus seed extracts in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Urolithiasis was induced by surgical implantations of zinc disc in the urinary bladders of rats. Upon postsurgical recovery, different doses of chloroform (CAM) and methanolic (MAM) extracts of A. moschatus seeds (viz., 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg body weight) were administered to disc implanted rats for the period of 7 days by the oral route. Antiurolithiatic activity was evaluated by measuring various dimensions of stones and estimating levels of various biomarkers in serum and urine samples. RESULTS: A significant decrease in urinary output was observed in disc implanted animals, which was prevented by the treatment with extracts. Supplementation with extracts caused significant improvement in glomerular filtration rate and urinary total protein excretion. The elevated levels of serum creatinine, uric acid, and blood urea nitrogen were also prevented by the extracts. The extracts significantly reduced deposition of calculi deposition around the implanted disc. This antiurolithiatic potential is observed at all doses (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg) of MAM, whereas only higher dose (400 mg/kg) of CAM showed significant antiurolithiatic potential. CONCLUSION: The extracts of A. moschatus seeds possessed significant antiurolithiatic activity. The possible mechanism underlying this effect is mediated collectively through diuretic, antioxidant, and free-radical scavenging effects of the plant.	a. moschatus urolithiasis
2	Water-extracted branch of Cinnamomum cassia promotes lung cancer cell apoptosis by inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase activity.Cinnamomum cassia Blume has been widely reported as the anti-tumor agent. However, the precise mechanism underlying its pro-apoptotic action is still not clear. Restraining aerobic glycolysis through suppression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDHK) is a promising strategy for cancer inhibition. In this study, we performed to investigate the anti-tumor action of C. cassia is mediated by PDHK inhibition. The inhibition of water-extracted branch of C. cassia (WBCC) on the activity of PDHK using both in vitro and cell-based kinase assay were examined in several lung cancer cells. WBCC reduced viabilities of several lung cancer cells with minimal cytotoxicity on normal bronchial epithelial cells. WBCC decreased lactate production through inhibiting activity of PDHK. In consequence of PDHK inhibition, WBCC increased ROS production, which damage mitochondria membrane stability. In addition, WBCC induced ROS- and mitochondria-dependent apoptotic cell death. Among the components of WBCC, cinnamic acid was founded as a major inhibitor on PDHK activity. This is first report that WBCC induces apoptosis of lung cancer cells through inhibiting PDHK activity. Our findings suggest that WBCC and cinnamic acid can be potential candidates for developing novel anti-cancer drugs through glycolysis metabolism.	cinnamic acid lung cancer
2	Inhibitory effect of phytoglycoprotein (24kDa) on allergy-related factors in compound 48/80-induced mast cells in vivo and in vitro.Mast cells are involved in immediate allergic reactions such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis. Allergic reactions caused by extracellular allergens such as xenobiotics may become a critical problem in living circumstances. Recently, we isolated and purified glycoprotein from Zanthoxylum piperitum DC fruit (ZPDC), and demonstrated that ZPDC glycoprotein (5-20mg/kg, 25-100mug/ml) has an inhibitory effect on allergy-related mediators in the compound 48/80-treated BALB/c and human mast cells (HMC-1 cells). Our results obtained from this study showed that ZPDC glycoprotein (10mg/kg) inhibited interleukin-4 (IL-4), immunoglobulin E (IgE), and histamine are released in mouse serum. Also, ZPDC glycoprotein (50mug/ml) attenuated the degranulation of mast cells, intracellular Ca(2+) levels, and the activities of phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB (p50 and p65), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the HMC-1 cells. Taken together, we speculate that the ZPDC glycoprotein might be one component found in natural products that has the ability to prevent dysfunction in the immune system caused by several different allergens.	zanthoxylum piperitum allergic rhinitis
1	Enrichment and Purification of the Bioactive Flavonoids from Flower of Abelmoschus manihot (L.) Medic Using Macroporous Resins.Flower of Abelmoschus manihot (FAM) is clinically effective to treat chronic kidney disease (CKD) with a relatively high dosage. To improve the efficacy and the compliance of patients, macroporous resins were adopted to enrich and purify flavonoids from FAM, which are thought to be the major renal protective constituents in FAM. After screening six different kinds of macroporous resins, HPD-100 was selected for its great adsorption and desorption capacity. Then, orthogonal design tests were used to optimize parameters in the processes of impurity removal and flavonoids of FAM desorption on column chromatogram. Moreover, process scale-up was performed, and purification effects maintained after amplification. After purification, the content of seven main flavonoids in the product increased from 8.29% to 51.43%. Protective and anti-inflammatory effects of crude extract and the flavonoid component of FAM after purification were investigated on the adriamycin-damaged HK-2 cells and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated Raw 264.7 cells models. Both bioactivities were improved greatly after purification for these two cell models. Therefore, the purification process had enriched the main bioactive constituents with potential alleviating kidney injury activities. The flavonoid component of FAM is worthy of being developed as an improved remedy for CKD with better patients' compliance.	abelmoschus manihot flavonoid
2	Bioactive components in the fruits of Ziziphus jujuba Mill. against the inflammatory irritant action of Euphorbia plants.Chinese jujube (also known as Chinese date) is the fruit of Ziziphus jujuba Mill. (Rhamnaceae). As a famous folk medicine, it is used as antidote in traditional Chinese formula, Shi Zao Decoction, to relieve the drastic inflammatory irritant nature of Euphorbia species. The irritant activities may cause serious adverse effects in clinical practices. This study aimed to investigate the active components of Z. jujuba through the inhibitory effects on the inflammatory cells activated by Euphorbia kansui and prostratin, a phorbol ester isolated from Euphorbia fischeriana. Peritoneal macrophage of rat and splenic lymphocyte (splenocyte) of mouse were selected to evaluate these actions in vitro. Nitric oxide (NO) release of macrophage and the proliferation of splenocyte were examined through Griess method and MTT assay. TNF-alpha, as an important pro-inflammatory cytokines, was detected with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Six fractions extracted from Z. jujuba were evaluated and fraction F (triterpene acids fraction) was demonstrated to be the most active part, and then, 21 compounds isolated from Z. jujuba were tested at the concentrations range from 1 mug/ml to 100 mug/ml. The results show that 7 compounds of them are likely to be active compounds concerning to their pronounced inhibitory action on the activated inflammatory cells. These effects might be helpful to attenuate the irritant action of Euphorbiaceae plants and protect the gastrointestinal tissue from potent inflammatory injury, which should be beneficial to some diseases, like inflammatory bowel disease.	z. jujuba gastrointestinal
2	Large-scale and effective screening of Korean medicinal plants for inhibitory activity on matrix metalloproteinase-9.Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) degrades type IV collagen constituting the major structural component of the basement membrane and extra cellular membrane. The enzymatic activity is found to be elevated in tumor tissues. With the aim of finding novel MMP-9 inhibitors from natural products, 87 extracts of oriental medicinal herbs, which are used as prescriptions for cancer treatment in traditional Korean medicine, were screened for their inhibitory activities towards MMP-9. It was found that most of the hexane and chloroform fractions as well as water extracts showed a weak inhibitory effect on MMP-9 activity at a concentration of 100mug/ml. However, a strong inhibition was found in the butanol fractions of Cinnamomum cassia PRESL, Magnolia obovata THUEB., Magnolia officinalis REHD. et WILS., Magnolia officinalis REHD. et WILS. var. biloba REHD. et WILS., and Euonymus alatus (THUNB.) SIEB. with inhibitory activity (&gt;90%) at a concentration of 100 microg/ml.	cinnamomum cassia cancer
3	In vitro antioxidant activities and anti-proliferative properties of the functional herb Abrus cantoniensis and its main alkaloid abrine.Abrus cantoniensis is a common and popular vegetative food consumed as beverage, soup and folk medicine in the tropical and subtropical areas of Asia. It has been claimed valuable for cleansing toxicants in the liver. However, the functional effects of A. cantoniensis have not yet been scientifically explored. This study comprehensively evaluated the in vitro antioxidant and anti-proliferative capacities of the herbal extract and the main alkaloid abrine. Abrine was qualitatively and quantitatively determined in methanol extract (ME) using HPLC-DAD and LC-MS/MS. The results showed that ME, ethyl acetate fraction (EF) and abrine exhibited comparable ABTS radical cation scavenging activities and reducing power to two commercial antioxidants (BHT and Trolox). The EF exerted strong cellular antioxidant activity and selective cytotoxicity against three cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Biological assays revealed that the EF induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M and apoptosis in MCF-7 and Hep3B cells after 48 h of treatment. Thus, A. cantoniensis exerted potent cellular antioxidant and anti-proliferative properties, highlighting why it has been traditionally used as a functional food. 	abrine cancer
1	Lonchocarpine Increases Nrf2/ARE-Mediated Antioxidant Enzyme Expression by Modulating AMPK and MAPK Signaling in Brain Astrocytes.Lonchocarpine is a phenylpropanoid compound isolated from Abrus precatorius that has anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, and antiepileptic activities. In the present study, we investigated the antioxidant effects of lonchocarpine in brain glial cells and analyzed its molecular mechanisms. We found that lonchocarpine suppressed reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cell death in hydrogen peroxide-treated primary astrocytes. In addition, lonchocarpine increased the expression of antioxidant enzymes, such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), which are all under the control of Nrf2/antioxidant response element (ARE) signaling. Further, mechanistic studies showed that lonchocarpine increases the nuclear translocation and DNA binding of Nrf2 to ARE as well as ARE-mediated transcriptional activities. Moreover, lonchocarpine increased the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and three types of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). By treating astrocytes with each signaling pathway-specific inhibitor, AMPK, c-jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK were identified to be involved in lonchocarpine-induced HO-1 expression and ARE-mediated transcriptional activities. Therefore, lonchocarpine may be a potential therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative diseases that are associated with oxidative stress.	abrus precatorius lonchocarpine
1	Development and validation of an LC-ESI-MS/MS method for the determination of nitidine chloride in rat plasma.A new liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass/mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) assay method has been developed and validated for the quantification of nitidine chloride (NC), an anti-cancer bioactive substance of Zanthoxylum nitidum (Roxb.) DC. plants, in rat plasma using carbamazepine as an internal standard (I.S.). The NC and I.S. were extracted from rat plasma by acetonitrile protein procedure. Chromatographic separation was carried out with a C(18) column (2.1 mm x 150 mm, 3 mum) with a security guard C18 column (4 mm x 20 mm, 3 mum). The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile-10 mM ammonium acetate buffer solution-formic acid (35:65:0.2, v/v/v) and delivered at the flow rate of 0.25 mL/min. LC-ESI-MS/MS was performed on a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry equipped with electrospray ionization (ESI) and positive multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). Target ions were monitored at [M](+)m/z 348.2 for NC and [M]+ m/z 237.2 for I.S. The method was linear over the concentration range of 5.0-1500.0 ng/mL. The intra- and inter-day relative standard deviations of the assay were less than 5.0%. The lower limit of quantification was 5.0 ng/mL. The developed method was successfully applied to the estimation of the pharmacokinetic parameters of NC by intravenous administration to rats.	zanthoxylum nitidum (roxb.) dc nitidine chloride
3	Prophylactic effects of quercetin and hyperoside in a calcium oxalate stone forming rat model.Quercetin and hyperoside (QH) are the two main constituents of the total flavone glycosides of Flos Abelmoschus manihot, which has been prescribed for treating chronic kidney disease for decades. This study aimed to investigate the effect of QH on calcium oxalate (CaOx) formation in ethylene glycol (EG)-fed rats. Rats were divided into three groups: an untreated stone-forming group, a QH-treated stone-forming group (20 mg/kg/day) and a potassium citrate-treated stone-forming group (potassium citrate was a worldwide-recognized calculi-prophylactic medicine). Ethylene glycol (0.5 %) was administered to the rats during the last week, and vitamin D3 was force-fed to induce hyperoxaluria and kidney calcium oxalate crystal deposition. 24 h urine samples were collected before and after inducing crystal deposits. Rats were killed and both kidneys were harvested after 3 weeks. Bisected kidneys were examined under a polarized light microscope for semi-quantification of the crystal-formation. The renal tissue superoxide dismutase and catalase levels were measured by Western blot. QH and potassium citrate have the ability to alkalinize urine. The number of crystal deposits decreased significantly in the QH-treated stone-forming group as compared to the other groups. Superoxide dismutase and catalase levels also increased significantly in the QH-treated stone-forming group, as compared with the untreated stone-forming group. QH administration has an inhibitory effect on the deposition of CaOx crystal in EG-fed rats and may be effective for preventing stone-forming disease.	Quercetin chronic kidney disease
1	In vitro assessment of synergistic combinations of essential oils against Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus (Acari: Ixodidae).Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus (Acari: Ixodidae), is one of the most important ectoparasite of cattle, responsible for causing severe economic losses in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The development of resistance to most of the commonly used chemical acaricides has stimulated the search for new herbal products as an eco-friendly tick control alternative. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro acaricidal activity of essential oils (EOs) of cloves (Syzygium aromaticum), bark of cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum) and leaves of lemon grass (Cymbopogon citratus) against unfed larvae of R. (B.)microplus by larval packet test. Also, various combinations were prepared by mixing of equal concentrations of any two and all three EOs and used to study the effects of interactions of mixtures against larvae of R. (B.) microplus. The lethal concentrations at 50% (LC50), 90% (LC90) and 99% (LC99) with 95% confidence limits (CL) were estimated by Probit analysis using PoloPlus. The computer software, CompuSyn, was used for determining the effects of interactions (synergistic, additive or antagonistic) of EO mixtures by calculation of Combination index (CI) and Dose-reduction index (DRI). Among the individual and mixture of two EOs, cinnamon EO and cinnamon EO + lemon grass EO combination showed highest acaricidal activity against R. (B.) microplus larvae. Further, the combination of cinnamon EO + lemon grass EO showed high synergism with CI value of 0.381, followed by cinnamon EO + clove EO showing moderate synergism whereas, clove EO + lemon grass EO showed only additive effect, with favorable dose reduction for each constituent drug in all three combinations. The combination of all three EOs (1:1:1) showed high synergism (CI value of 0.376) and favorable dose reduction (DRI index of 8.19, 25.64 and 4.64 for clove, cinnamon and lemon grass EOs, respectively) against R. (B.) microplus larvae.	clove essential oils
1	Structural characterization of polysaccharides from Zizyphus jujuba and evaluation of antioxidant activity.Fruit of Zizyphus jujuba Mill, a traditional Chinese herb widely consumed in Asian countries, has been reported to possess several vital biological activities. This study intends to develop an appropriate analytical method for isolation of polysaccharides from Z. jujuba fruits and evaluate their antioxidant activity. Initially, powdered Z. jujuba fruits were subjected to hot water extraction, followed by ethanol precipitation, deproteination, dialysis and fractionation in a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column. One neutral polysaccharide fraction (ZJPN) and 3 acidic polysaccharide fractions (ZJPa1, ZJPa2 and ZJPa3) were isolated with the average MW ranging from 40,566 to 129,518 Da. GC analysis revealed that 6 monosaccharides, namely, rhamnose, arabinose, xylose, mannose, glucose and galactose were present in polysaccharide fractions. The galacturonic acid content in polysaccharide fractions followed the order: ZJPa3&gt;ZJPa2&gt;ZJPa1&gt;ZJPN. All the 4 polysaccharide fractions were found to be more effective in scavenging superoxide anions than hydroxyl radicals, while acidic polysaccharides showed a more pronounced effect in chelating ferrous ion.	z. jujuba rhamnose
1	Comparison on the fatty acid profiles of liver, subcutaneous fat and muscle from feedlot steers finished on diets supplemented with or without cinnamaldehyde or monensin.BACKGROUND: Cinnamaldehyde (CIN) is the main active component of cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia) oil and has been tested as alternative feed additive in cattle production. Little information was available on the effect of dietary CIN in comparison to monensin (MO) on beef fatty acid (FA) profile. This study analyzed FA profiles of liver, subcutaneous fat and pars costalis diaphragmatis (PCD) muscle obtained from steers (n = 70) finished on diets: control, a barley grain-silage feedlot diet; 330 mg/head.day MO; and 400, 800 or 1600 mg/head.day CIN treatments. RESULTS: Inclusion of MO or CIN did not affect total saturated, unsaturated, polyunsaturated FA and individual FA in the various tissues with exceptions that proportion of palmitic acid in PCD muscle was increased by 800 mg/steer.day CIN (P &lt; 0.05). There were positive correlations (P &lt; 0.05) on oleic, linoleic, conjugated linoleic acid (CLA)-c9,t11 and 18:1-t10 between the subcutaneous fat and PCD muscle, and on alpha-linolenic acid, CLA-c9,t11 and 18:1-t10 between PCD muscle and liver, whereas correlations on the FA between the subcutaneous fat and liver were not significant except for 18:1-t10 (P &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the supplementation of CIN and MO to feedlot diet has limited effect on beef FA profiles.	cinnamomum cassia linoleic acid
1	Involvement of tannins and flavonoids in the in vitro effects of Newbouldia laevis and Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides extracts on the exsheathment of third-stage infective larvae of gastrointestinal nematodes.The present study aimed at examining the possible role of tannins and flavonoids on the in vitro anthelmintic properties of the extracts of two plants from the southern area of Western Africa, i.e. Newbouldia laevis and Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides. Extracts of the two plants were prepared by use of acetone/water (70/30) and their anthelmintic activity was measured by use of the larval exsheathment inhibition assay (LEIA) applied on the abomasal species, Haemonchus contortus and the intestinal species Trichostrongylus colubriformis. Three concentrations of extracts were evaluated to examine the possible dose effect. In addition, the possible involvement of tannins and flavonoids was examined by comparing the levels of inhibition of larval exsheathment obtained with the same extracts, after of not addition of PVPP which forms complexes with these compounds. The results indicate significant effects with both plants and both nematode species. In the range of concentrations examined, the results were dose-dependent for N. laevis extracts but not for Z. zanthoxyloides because the three doses applied provoked a similar highly significant inhibition whatever the tested dose. The use of PVPP indicated for both plant and nematode species, that tannins and flavonoids are involved partly in the effect but that some other biochemical compounds were also involved in both plants.	z. zanthoxyloides tannins
1	Purification and characterization of flavonoids from the leaves of Zanthoxylum bungeanum and correlation between their structure and antioxidant activity.Nine flavonoids were isolated and characterized from the leaves of Zanthoxylum bungeanum. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic techniques as quercetin (1), afzelin (2), quercitrin (3), trifolin (4), quercetin-3-O-beta-D-glucoside (5), isorhamnetin 3-O-alpha-L-rhamnoside (6), hyperoside (7), vitexin (8) and rutin (9). All compounds were isolated from the leaves of Z. bungeanum for the first time. Five compounds (2, 4, 5, 6 and 8) were found for the first time in the genus Zanthoxylum. To learn the mechanisms underlying its health benefits, in vitro (DPPH, ABTS, FRAP and lipid peroxidation inhibition assays) and in vivo (protective effect on Escherichia coli under peroxide stress) antioxidant activities of the nine flavonoids were measured. Quercetin and quercetin glycosides (compounds 1, 3, 5, 7, 9) showed the highest antioxidant activity. Structure-activity relationships indicated that the -OH in 4' position on the B ring and the -OH in 7 position on the A ring possessed high antioxidant activity; B ring and/or A ring with adjacent -OH groups could greatly increase their antioxidant ability. Also, due to the different structures of various flavonoids, they will certainly exhibit different antioxidant capacity when the reactions occur in solution or in oil-in-water emulsion. These findings suggest that Z. bungeanum leaves may have health benefits when consumed. It could become a useful supplement for pharmaceutical products and functional food ingredients in both nutraceutical and food industries as a potential source of natural antioxidants. 	z. bungeanum trifolin
1	Myricetin as the active principle of Abelmoschus moschatus to lower plasma glucose in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.The antihyperglycemic action of myricetin, purified from the aerial part of Abelmoschus moschatus (Malvaceae), was investigated in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (STZ-diabetic rats). Bolus intravenous injection of myricetin decreased the plasma glucose concentrations in a dose-dependent manner in STZ-diabetic rats. Myricetin at the effective dose (1.0 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the increase of plasma glucose induced by an intravenous glucose challenge test in normal rats. A stimulatory effect of myricetin on glucose uptake of the soleus muscles isolated from STZ-diabetic rats was obtained in a concentration-dependent manner from 0.01 to 10.0 micromol/L. The increase of glucose utilization by myricetin was further characterized using the enhancement of glycogen synthesis in isolated hepatocytes of STZ-diabetic rats. These results suggest that myricetin has an ability to enhance glucose utilization to lower plasma glucose in diabetic rats lacking insulin.	abelmoschus moschatus myricetin
3	Therapeutic effects on murine oral candidiasis by oral administration of cassia (Cinnamomum cassia) preparation.We examined the effects of spices and herbs on Candida albicans growth using in vitro assay and therapeutic activity of some selected herbal preparations against murine oral candidiasis. All tested samples: lemongrass (Cymbopogon citratus), lemon balm (Melissa officinalis), thyme (Thymus vulgaris), rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa), green tea (Camellia sinensis), and cassia (Cinnamomum cassia) inhibited Candida mycelial growth in vitro. The results of this assay showed that the anti-Candida activity of lemongrass, green tea, and cassia is stronger than that of the other tested herbs. Oral administration of lemongrass or green tea did not result in significant improvement in the murine oral candidiasis, while the administration of cassia improved the symptoms and reduced the number of viable Candida cells in the oral cavity. The results of in vitro Candida growth assay including GC/MS analysis suggested that cinnamaldehyde in the cassia preparation was the principal component responsible for the inhibitory activity of Candida mycelial growth. These findings suggest that oral intake of a cassia preparation is a clinical candidate for a prophylactic or therapeutic tool against oral Candida infection.	cinnamaldehyde oral candidiasis

1	On the possibility of lipid-induced regulation of conformation and immunogenicity of influenza a virus H1/N1 hemagglutinin as antigen of TI-complexes.The tubular immunostimulating complex (TI-complex) consisting of cucumarioside A2-2, cholesterol and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) from marine macrophytes is the perspective antigen delivery system for subunit vaccines. MGDG is a lipid matrix for the protein antigen incorporated in the TI-complex. The aim of the present work was to study the influence of MGDGs from different macrophytes on conformation and immunogenicity of the secreted recombinant uncleaved hemagglutinin monomer (HA0S) of influenza A virus H1/N1. Differential scanning calorimetry, fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism showed a dependence of the conformational changes of HA0S on the microviscosity of MGDG. The most viscous MGDG from Zostera marina induced the strongest rearrangements in protein conformation. Immunization of mice with HA0S within TI-complexes comprising different MGDGs resulted in an approximately 2-fold increase of the levels of anti-HA0S antibodies and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) compared with those induced by HA0S alone. TI-complexes based on MGDG from Z. marina stimulated the maximal production of GM-CSF. However, humoral immune response (anti-HA0S antibodies), unlike cell-mediated immune response (GM-CSF), did not depend on the physicochemical properties of MGDGs. It is assumed that this is due to the different localization and conformational lipid sensitivity of the HA0S regions, which are responsible for these types of immune responses.	z. marina cucumarioside a2-2
2	Antiplasmodial and cytotoxic activities of Rwandan medicinal plants used in the treatment of malaria.AIM OF THE STUDY: In our study, methanol, dichloromethane and aqueous extracts of 13 Rwandan medicinal plants used in the treatment of malaria were tested for in vitro antiplasmodial activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The growth inhibition of chloroquine-sensitive Plasmodium falciparum strain (3D7) was evaluated using the measurement of lactate dehydrogenase activity. The active extracts were also tested against the chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum strain (W2) and for cytotoxicity assay using human normal foetal lung fibroblasts (WI-38). RESULTS: The majority of the plants tested showed an antiplasmodial activity and the best results were observed with dichloromethane leaf and flower extracts of Tithonia diversifolia, leaf extract of Microglossa pyrifolia and root extract of Rumex abyssinicus, methanol leaf extract of Fuerstia africana, root bark extracts of Zanthoxylum chalybeum and methanol bark extract of Terminalia mollis. Those extracts were active (IC(50)&lt;15mug/ml) on both chloroquine-sensitive and resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum. Zanthoxylum chalybeum, Solanecio mannii and Terminalia mollis presented the best selectivity index. CONCLUSIONS: The traditional use of most of the plant evaluated was confirmed by the antiplasmodial test. This study revealed for the first time the antiplasmodial activity of two plants: Terminalia mollis and Rumex abyssinicus.	rumex abyssinicus malaria
2	Phytochemical profiles and biological activity evaluation of Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim seed against asthma in murine models.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim seed (ZBMS) has been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) as an ingredient of polyherbal formulations for the treatment of inflammation and asthma. The aim of this study was to analyze the major composition and to evaluate the anti-asthma activity of ZBMS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Some murine models including acetylcholine/histamine-induced asthma, ovalbumin-induced airway inflammation, ear edema and toe swelling measurement, citric acid-induced cough, and anti-stress abilities were investigated to fully study the anti-asthma activity of ZBMS.GC chromatography was also performed to analyze the major fatty acid composition of ZBMS. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that the major fatty acid composition of ZBMS includes oleic acid (20.15%), linoleic acid (26.54%), and alpha-linolenic acid (30.57%), which was the leading component of ZBMS, and that the total fatty acid content of ZBMS was 77.27%. The murine models demonstrated that ZBMS displays a protective effect on guinea pig sensitization, a dose-dependent inhibition of the increases in RL and decreases in Cdyn, which resulted in the relief of auricle edema and toe swelling in mice and anti-stress activity. CONCLUSION: Our results validate the traditional use of ZBMS for the treatment of asthma and other inflammatory joint disorders, and suggest that ZBMS has potential as a new therapeutic agent for asthma management.	zanthoxylum bungeanum maxim joint disorders
2	Cortex cinnamomi extract prevents streptozotocin- and cytokine-induced beta-cell damage by inhibiting NF-kappaB.AIM: To clarify the mechanism underlying the anti-diabetic activities of cortex cinnamomi extract (CCE). METHODS: To induce in vivo diabetes, mice were injected with streptozotocin (STZ) via a tail vein (100 mg STZ/kg body weight). To determine the effects of CCE, mice were administered CCE twice daily for 7 d by oral gavage starting 1 wk before the STZ injection. Blood glucose and plasma insulin concentration were measured as an index of diabetes. Also, to induce cytotoxicity of RINm5F cells, we treated with cytokines (IL-1beta (2.0 ng/mL) and IFN-gamma (100 U/mL)). Cell viability and nitric oxide production were measured colorimetrically. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA and protein expression were determined by RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. The activation of NF-kappaB was assayed by using gel mobility shift assays of nuclear extracts. RESULTS: Treatment of mice with STZ resulted in hyperglycemia and hypoinsulinemia, which was further evidenced by immunohistochemical staining of islets. However, the diabetogenic effects of STZ were completely prevented when mice were pretreated with CCE. The inhibitory effect of CCE on STZ-induced hyperglycemia was mediated through the suppression of iNOS expression. In rat insulinoma RINm5F cells, CCE completely protected against interleukin-1beta and interferon-gamma-mediated cytotoxicity. Moreover, RINm5F cells incubated with CCE showed significant reductions in interleukin-1beta and interferon-gamma-induced nitric oxide production and in iNOS mRNA and protein expression, and these findings correlated well with in vivo observations. CONCLUSION: The molecular mechanism by which CCE inhibits iNOS gene expression appears to involve the inhibition of NF-kappaB activation. These results reveal the possible therapeutic value of CCE for the prevention of diabetes mellitus progression.	cinnamomi STZ
1	Cytotoxic activity of extracts and crude saponins from Zanthoxylum armatum DC. against human breast (MCF-7, MDA-MB-468) and colorectal (Caco-2) cancer cell lines.BACKGROUND: Zanthoxylum armatum DC has been an important traditional plant known for its medicinal properties. It is well known for its antimicrobial, larvicidal and cytotoxic activities. METHODS: The potential anticancer effects of the methanol extract and the crude saponins from fruit, bark and leaves of Z. armatum on breast (MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7) and colorectal (Caco-2) cancer cell lines using MTT, neutral red uptake(NRU) and DAPI stain assays were evaluated. RESULTS: In MTT assay the methanol extract of fruit (Zf), bark (Zb) and leaves (Zl) of Zanthoxylum armatum, showed significant and dose dependent growth inhibition of MCF-7, MDA MB-468 and Caco-2 cancer cell lines in a dose of 200 mug/ml and above. The saponins (Zf.Sa, Zb.Sa and Zl.Sa) showed significant activity against MDA MB-468 (95, 94.5 and 85.3%) as compared to MCF-7 (79.8, 9.43, 49.08%) and Caco-2 (75.8, 61.8, 68.62%) respectively. The extracts were further tested in more sensitive NRU assay and its was found that Zf extract showed higher cytotoxic activity as compared to Zb and Zl extracts with 100 mug/ml concentration. The breast cancer cell lines showed more sensitivity toward the crude saponins from fruit and bark with maximum inhibition of up to 93.81(+-2.32) % with respect to 71.19(+- 2.76) of Actinomycin-D. DAPI staining experiment showed that saponins from fruit induced apoptosis mode of cell death in all three types of cell lines while saponins form leaves and bark showed similar results against MDA MB-468 indicated by nuclear fragmentation and chromatin condensation. The effect of saponins from fruit, bark and leaves (Zf.Sa, Zb.Sa and Zl.Sa) against Caco-2 cell lines inhibited the growth of Caco-2 by 53.16 (+-3.31) %, 66.43 (+- 3.24) and 45.96 (+- 10.67) respectively with respect to Actinomycin-D (4 muM) which showed the growth inhibition of 65.40(+-4.29) %. CONCLUSION: The current study clearly demonstrates that the extract and crude saponins from fruit, bark and leaves of traditional medicinal plant Zanthoxyllum armatum DC., has the potential to exert its cytotoxic effect on cancer cell lines isolated form human by a mechanism involving apoptosis. The overall finding demonstrate that this plant specially fruits, could be potential source of new anticancer compounds for possible drug development against cancer.	zanthoxylum armatum saponins
1	Topical antiinflammatory activity of the major lipophilic constituents of the rhizome of Zingiber cassumunar. Part I: The essential oil.The essential oil of the rhizome of Zingiber cassumunar was found to exhibit a topical antiinflammatory effect, when tested using the model of carrageenan-induced hind paw edema in rats (ID(50) = 22 mg oil/paw). Individual assessment of topical antiinflammatory activity of the five major components of the oil demonstrated that (E)-1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)butadiene (DMPBD), terpinen-4-ol and alpha-terpinene significantly inhibited edema formation, whereas sabinene and gamma-terpinene were inactive up to 6 mg/paw. The most active compound, DMPBD, was found to be an antiinflammatory agent twice as potent as the reference drug diclofenac (ID(50) = 3 vs 6 mg/paw, respectively).	zingiber cassumunar gamma-terpinene
1	Gastroprotective Activity of the Total Flavones from Abelmoschus manihot (L.) Medic Flowers.Background: Abelmoschus manihot (L.) Medic flower is a medicinal plant for the treatment of diseases in China. The present study was carried out to scientifically validate the gastroprotective activity and clarify the possible mechanism of the total flavones from Abelmoschus manihot (L.) Medic flower is a medicinal plant for the treatment of diseases in China. The present study was carried out to scientifically validate the gastroprotective activity and clarify the possible mechanism of the total flavones from. Methods: Gastric ulcer was induced in mice by oral administration of ethanol. The gastroprotective activity of TFA was evaluated by the gastric ulcer index and histological examinations. The gastric tissue was collected in the form of homogenate. The level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH), the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), and protein content were measured. Western blotting for the expression of Bax, Bcl-2, TNF-alpha, and NF-kappaB(p65) was also carried out. The effect of TFA was compared with that of standard antiulcer drug omeprazole (100 mg/kg). Results: This gastroprotective effect of TFA could be attributed to the increase in the activity of SOD and GSH and decrease in the levels of MDA and also decrease in the levels of Bax, TNF-alpha, and NF-kappaB(p65) was also carried out. The effect of TFA was compared with that of standard antiulcer drug omeprazole (100 mg/kg). Conclusion: The findings of this study demonstrated that TFA could significantly attenuate ethanol-induced gastric injury via antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic effects.	abelmoschus manihot flavones
1	Studies on the effects of essential-oil-based feed additives on performance, ileal nutrient digestibility, and selected bacterial groups in the gastrointestinal tract of piglets.The aim of this study was to assess the effects of 2 different phytogenic products on performance, ileal nutrient digestibility, and composition of the intestinal microbiota. The 2 phytogenic products contained different essential oil mixtures (EOM) characterized by either menthol (Mentha arvensis; EOM-M) or cinnamon aldehyde (Cinnamomum aromaticum; EOM-C) as main constituents. Three treatments consisted of control diet without EOM addition and diets supplemented with EOM-M or EOM-C. Reproducibility of the effects was examined in 4 trials with a total of 300 male castrated and female piglets weaned at 25 d of age. The number of pens per treatment in trials I through III were 7, 9, and 9, respectively, for research station conditions, and 10 in trial IV for simulated farm conditions. In research station conditions, the experimental unit consisted of flat deck pens with 2 piglets per pen, whereas it consisted of floor pens with straw bedding with 5 piglets per pen in farm conditions. The feed additives had no effect on feed intake or BW gain. Improvements (P &lt; 0.05) in G:F were observed for EOM-M supplemented diets in 2 of 4 trials as well as for the combined data of all trials. These improvements were associated with greater (P&lt;0.05) apparent ileal digestibility of CP and of most AA. The effect of EOM-C on these response criteria was intermediate between control and EOM-M. Real-time PCR analysis of the gastrointestinal contents for 7 bacterial groups (Lactobacillus spp., Enterococcus spp., Clostridium coccoides and Clostridium leptum cluster, Escherichia spp., and Escherichia coli toxin estII) indicated no effect of treatments on the gastrointestinal microbiota. It was concluded that EOM-M consistently improved feed efficiency in weaned piglets, and it was associated with improved ileal protein and AA digestibility. In general, however, the effectiveness of EOM as feed additives differs considerably depending on the constituents.	cinnamomum aromaticum essential oil
2	Cassia Cinnamon Supplementation Reduces Peak Blood Glucose Responses but Does Not Improve Insulin Resistance and Sensitivity in Young, Sedentary, Obese Women.Cassia cinnamon has been suggested to lower blood glucose (BG) and serum insulin (SI) due to an improvement in insulin resistance (IR) and sensitivity (IS). This study compared the effects Cassia cinnamon had on calculated IR and IS values and BG and SI in response to an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in young, sedentary, and obese women. On three separate days, 10 women had a fasted venous blood sample obtained. Participants were given 5 g of encapsulated placebo (PLC) or 5 g of encapsulated Cassia cinnamon bark (CASS). Three hours after the initial blood sample, another blood sample was obtained to calculate values for IS and IR. The participants then completed an OGTT by consuming a 75 g glucose solution. Blood was obtained 30, 60, 90, and 120 min following glucose ingestion. IS and IR were not significantly different between placebo and Cassia (p &gt; .05). The peak BG concentration in response to the OGTT was significantly lower at the 30 min time point for CASS, as compared to PLC (140 +- 5.8 and 156 +- 5.2 mg/dL, p = .025); however, there was no significant difference between treatments for SI (p &gt; .05). The area-under-the-curve responses for BG and SI were not significantly different between PLC and CASS (p &gt; .05). This study suggests that a 5 g dose of Cassia cinnamon may reduce the peak BG response and improve glucose tolerance following an OGTT, but with no improvement in IS and IR in young, sedentary, obese women.	cinnamon glucose tolerance
1	Protective effect of the essential oil of Zanthoxylum myriacanthum var. pubescens against dextran sulfate sodium-induced intestinal inflammation in mice.BACKGROUND: Zanthoxylum myriacanthum var. pubescens is an ethnic medicine for digestive disease known as Maqian. A previous report showed that the Maqian fruits essential oil (MQEO) exhibited an NO inhibitory effect on RAW 264.7 cells, but the effect on inflammatory disease in vivo remains unknown. PURPOSE: To investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of Z. myriacanthum var. pubescens as potential candidate for the treatment of intestinal inflammation. STUDY DESIGN: Evaluation of anti-inflammatory effect of MQEO using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced intestinal inflammation in mice and exploration of the mechanisms with THP-1 cells. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were provided drinking water containing 3% DSS for 10 days followed by normal drinking water for 3 days. MQEO (35 and 70mg/kg) were given 5 days before experiments and continued for another 13 days. At the end of experiments, mice were euthanized and colonic tissue was collected to be analyzed by H&amp;E staining, RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry for evaluating the damage of colons, the mRNA levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-12p35 and TNF-alpha, and the expressions of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). The LPS-stimulated THP-1 cell line was used for exploring the role of inflammatory markers using ELISA, western blot and flow cytometry methods. RESULTS: Oral administration of MQEO (35 and 70mg/kg) markedly attenuated the symptoms of intestinal inflammation, including diarrhea, rectal bleeding, and loss of body weight. It also reduced the shortening of colon length and histopathological damage. The expressions of MPO and MMP-9 and the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6 and IL-12p35) in colonic tissue significantly decreased after MQEQ treatment. The activation of NF-kappaB p65 in colonic mucosa was also markedly suppressed. In addition, MQEO significantly suppressed LPS-stimulated production of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, effectively blocked phosphorylation of IKK and IkappaB, and dose-dependently reduced LPS-stimulated expression of TLR4 in THP-1 cells at concentrations ranging from 0.01% to 0.05% (v/v). CONCLUSION: MQEO exhibited protective effect against DSS-induced intestinal inflammation and the anti-inflammatory activity may be associated with TLR4 mediated NF-kappaB signaling pathway, suggesting it might be used as an anti-inflammatory agent.	z. myriacanthum var essential oil
1	Phenylpropanoids from cinnamon bark reduced beta-amyloid production by the inhibition of beta-secretase in Chinese hamster ovarian cells stably expressing amyloid precursor protein.beta-Amyloid (Abeta) is a substance of Alzheimer disease (AD), which is generated via the amyloidogenic pathway from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-secretase and gamma-secretase. Inhibition of Abeta production is a potential therapeutic approach to AD. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that cinnamon bark (Cinnamomi Cortex Spissus), the dried bark of Cinnamomum cassia Blume (Lauraceae), and its constituents are beneficial to AD. The methanol extract of cinnamon bark efficiently reduced Abeta40 production in Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cells stably expressing APP as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Bioassay-guided isolation of cinnamon bark extract was carried out using open column chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography, and the following 6 phenylpropanoids were isolated: syringaresinol (1); medioresinol (2); coumarin (3); 2-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (4); cryptamygin A (5); and 3',5,7-trimethoxy epicatechin (6). Among these, 4 mug/mL medioresinol and cryptamygin A reduced Abeta40 production by 50% and 60%, respectively, compared with dimethyl sulfoxide-treated control cells. The IC50 values of medioresinol and cryptamygin A for the inhibition of Abeta40 production were 10.8 and 8.2 mug/mL, respectively. Furthermore, treatment of APP-CHO cells with either compound decreased the amount of beta-secretase and sAPPbeta (the proteolytic fragment of APP catalyzed by beta-secretase). These results suggest that the antiamyloidogenic activity of cinnamon bark extract was exerted by medioresinol and cryptamygin A via a reduction in the amount of beta-secretase. The extract of cinnamon bark contains potentially valuable antiamyloidogenic agents for the prevention and treatment of AD.	cinnamon medioresinol
4	2-hydroxycinnamaldehyde inhibits SW620 colon cancer cell growth through AP-1 inactivation.Cinnamaldehyde derivatives isolated from Cinnamomum cassia have been widely used for treating dyspepsia, gastritis, and inflammatory disease as well as cancer. To investigate the anti-tumor activities of several cinnamaldehyde derivatives, we compared the inhibitory effect of cinnamaldehyde derivatives on cell growth and AP-1 transcriptional activity in SW620 human colon cancer cells since AP-1 is a transcriptional factor implicated to control cancer cell growth. Among the derivatives, 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (HCA) most significantly inhibited cancer cell growth and AP-1 transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 12.5 and 9 microg/ml, respectively. In further studies on the mechanism, we found that consistent with the inhibitory effect on cell growth, HCA dose-dependently (0-20 microg/ml) inhibited DNA binding activity of AP-1 accompanied with down regulation of c-Jun and c-Fos expressions. HCA also induced apoptotic cell death as well as expression of the apoptosis-regulating gene caspase-3, but inhibited the anti-apoptosis regulating gene bcl-2 in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggested that HCA has the most potent inhibitory effect against human colon cancer cell growth, and AP-1 may be an important target of HCA.	AP-1 colon cancer
1	Seasonal variation in the leaf essential oil composition of Zanthoxylum clava-herculis growing in Huntsville, Alabama.The seasonal variation in the chemical composition of the leaf essential oil of Zanthoxylum clava-herculis has been analyzed by GC-MS. Three individual trees were sampled four times during the course of the 2004 growing season. Notable differences were recorded in the essential oil yields from the three trees on the four collection dates; yields were highest in May and lowest in July. The leaf essential oils were made up of 25 components, largely menthane monoterpenoids, dominated by limonene (44-73%) and 1,8-cineole (16-43%), with lesser amounts of alpha-thujene, linalool, gamma-terpinene, and alpha-terpineol. The ratio of oxygenated monoterpenoids to monoterpene hydrocarbons generally increased during the season, largely reflected in the 1,8-cineole/limonene ratio.	zanthoxylum clava-herculis gamma-terpinene
2	Algorithm for complementary and alternative medicine practice and research in type 2 diabetes.OBJECTIVE: To develop a model to direct the prescription of nutritional and botanical medicines in the treatment of type 2 diabetes for both clinical and research purposes. METHODS: Available literature on nutritional and botanical medicines was reviewed and categorized as follows: antioxidant/anti-inflammatory; insulin sensitizer; and beta-cell protectant/insulin secretagogue. Literature describing laboratory assessment for glycemic control, insulin resistance, and beta-cell reserve was also reviewed and a clinical decision tree was developed. RESULTS: Clinical algorithms were created to guide the use of nutritional and botanic medicines using validated laboratory measures of glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, and beta-cell reserve. Nutrient and botanic medicines with clinical trial research support include coenzyme Q10, carnitine, alpha-lipoic acid, N-acetylcysteine, vitamin D, vitamin C, vitamin E, chromium, vanadium, omega-3 fatty acids, cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia), fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum), and gymnema (Gymnema sylvestre). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical algorithms can direct supplementation in clinical practice and provide research models for clinical investigation. Algorithms also provide a framework for integration of future evidence as it becomes available. Research funding to investigate potentially beneficial practices in complementary medicine is critically important for optimal patient care and safety.	trigonella foenum-graecum diabetes
0	Compounds from Sichuan and Melegueta peppers activate, covalently and non-covalently, TRPA1 and TRPV1 channels.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Oily extracts of Sichuan and Melegueta peppers evoke pungent sensations mediated by different alkylamides [mainly hydroxy-alpha-sanshool (alpha-SOH)] and hydroxyarylalkanones (6-shogaol and 6-paradol). We assessed how transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) and TRP vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), two chemosensory ion channels, participate in these pungent sensations. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The structure-activity relationships of these molecules on TRPA1 and TRPV1 was measured by testing natural and synthetic analogues using calcium and voltage imaging on dissociated dorsal root ganglia neurons and human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing the wild-type channels or specific cysteine mutants using glutathione trapping as a model to probe TRPA1 activation. In addition, using Trpv1 knockout mice, the compounds' aversive responses were measured in a taste brief-access test. KEY RESULTS: For TRPA1 activation, the cis C6 double bond in the polyenic chain of alpha-SOH was critical, whereas no structural specificity was required for activation of TRPV1. Both 6-shogaol and 6-paradol were found to activate TRPV1 and TRPA1 channels, whereas linalool, an abundant terpene in Sichuan pepper, activated TRPA1 but not TRPV1 channels. Alkylamides and 6-shogaol act on TRPA1 by covalent bonding whereas none of these compounds activated TRPV1 through such interactions. Finally, TRPV1 mutant mice retained sensitivity to 6-shogaol but were not responsive to alpha-SOH. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The pungent nature of components of Sichuan and Melegueta peppers was mediated via interactions with TRPA1 and TRPV1 channels and may explain the aversive properties of these compounds.	6-shogaol TRPV1

J.Presl (Lauraceae), a widely used traditional Chinese medicine, is well known to exert hot property. It is recorded as dispelling cold drug in ancient Chinese monographs, such as Synopsis of golden chamber published in Han dynasty. According to Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2015), Cinnamomum cassia (L.) J.Presl (Cinnamon) has the functions of dispersing cold, relieving pain, warming meridians and promoting blood circulation. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of Cinnamon extract (CE) on cold endurance and the mechanism of thermogenesis activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The improving effect of hypothermia were evaluated with body temperature by infrared camera and multi-thermo thermometer. In vivo, the thermogenic effect was observed with energy metabolism and substrate utilization. The activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) was evaluated with the histomorphology and expression of thermogenic protein. In vitro, the uncoupling effects on mitochondrial was evaluated with Seahorse and fluorescent staining. The mechanism of thermogenesis was explored in brown adipocyte. RESULTS: The body temperature and energy expenditure were significantly increased by CE administration in cold environment. In morphology, lipid droplets were reduced and the number of mitochondrial was increased. CE significantly increased the non-shivering thermogenesis via upregulating the expression of thermogenic protein. In vitro, the uncoupling effect was obviously along with the decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production. It was confirmed that the thermogenesis effect was induced via lipolysis and energy metabolism. In addition, CE also alleviated myocardium injury in the morphology in cold environment. Moreover, the major constituent was identified as (1) coumarin, (2) cinnamic acid, (3) cinnamaldehyde and (4) 2-methoxy cinnamaldehyde. CONCLUSIONS: The mechanism of improving cold tolerance was related to lipolysis and activation of BAT. Meanwhile, we provided a kind of potential prevention methods for cold injury.	cinnamomum cassia cinnamic acid
2	Therapeutic potential of root and stem bark of wild medicinal plant Ziziphus mauritiana (Lamk.) against silica induced toxicity in Wistar albino rats.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ziziphus mauritiana (Lamk.) of the family Rhamnaceae is a traditional herbal medicinal plant commonly called as 'ber' (Indian jujube). It is traditionally used as food source and helps in treatment of various diseases like malaria, asthma, diarrhoea, typhoid, diabetes, skin diseases and acts as a pain killer. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to evaluate the ability of extracts of barks of root and stem of Ziziphus mauritiana (ZM) to cure silica induced toxicity in Wistar albino rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experiments carried out on the acute toxicity studies of silica and therapeutic potential of ZM extracts were based on OECD guidelines and from these results lethal dose (LD50) values were determined. Silica was administered by IP injection at 20 mg/kg b.w. for 10 days and roots and stem barks extracts of ZM were fed orally by gavage at 400 mg/kg b.w. for 21 days. Assessments of biochemical, haematological parameters as well as liver histological examination were performed in the study. RESULTS: After 21 days of oral feeding of extracts of root and stem of ZM, it was found to alter the liver histology. Significant decrease in enzymes such as ALT, AST, ALP, LDH and urea, creatinine and uric acid levels in serum were recorded. Treatment with extracts could help enzymatic activity of liver antioxidant enzymes to settle towards normal level and significant decrease in the lipid peroxidation along with increase in the value of GSH in liver, was also observed. In addition, extracts of ZM also helped to reduce the serum NO, IL-6 and TNF-alpha level. CONCLUSION: Results of this study has suggested that the extracts of root and stem bark of ZM can be used for therapeutic purpose to prevent silica induced toxicity. ZM extracts could be utilised as natural antioxidant and immunotherapeutic medicines to protect silica induced cell damage.	jujube skin diseases
2	Abrus precatorius Poisoning: A Retrospective Study of 112 Patients.Abrus precatorius is a rare but important cause of plant poisoning, especially in tropical countries like India.

2	Antioxidant and antiproliferative activities of Abrus precatorius leaf extracts--an in vitro study.BACKGROUND: The use of traditional medicine at the primary health care level is widespread and plant-based treatments are being recommended for curing various diseases by traditional medical practitioners all over the world. The phytochemicals present in the fruits, vegetables and medicinal plants are getting attention day-by-day for their active role in the prevention of several human diseases. Abrus precatorius is a widely distributed tropical medicinal plant with several therapeutic properties. Therefore in the present study, A. precatorius leaf extracts were examined for their antioxidant and cytotoxic properties in vitro in order to discover resources for new lead structures or to improve the traditional medicine. METHODS: In this study, antioxidant and antiproliferative properties of the different leaf extracts (hexane, ethyl acetate, ethanol and water) from A. precatorius were investigated along with the quantification of the polyphenol and flavonoid contents. The ability of deactivating free radicals was extensively investigated with in vitro biochemical methods like DPPH( ), ( )OH, NO, SO(2-) scavenging assays and inhibition capability of Fe(II)-induced lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, antiproliferative activities using different human cancer cell lines and primary cell line was carried out by MTT method. RESULTS: Total phenolic content and total flavonoid content of the extracts were found in the range of 1.65 +- 0.22 to 25.48 +- 0.62 GAE mg/g dw and 6.20 +- 0.41 to 17.16 +- 1.04 QE mg/g dw respectively. The experimental results further revealed that A. precatorius extracts showed strong antiradical properties, capable to chelate Fe(2+) and possess good inhibition ability of lipid peroxidation. In addition, as a first step towards the identification of phytoconstituents endowed with potent chemopreventive activities, we evaluated the inhibitory effects of A. precatorius extracts on the proliferation of four different human tumour cell lines such as human colon adenocarcinoma cells (Colo-205), human retinoblastoma cancer cells (Y79), human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2) and Leukemia cells (SupT1). Ethanol extract (APA) and ethyl acetate extract (APE) of A. precatorius had apparent capabilities of inhibiting the survival of tested human cancer cell lines. Moreover, it was observed that the A. precatorius extracts did not inhibit the growth of mice peritoneal macrophages, thus confirming that plants extracts are selective against the cancer cell lines. CONCLUSION: This work provides a scientific support for the high antioxidant and antiproliferative activity of this plant and thus it may find potential applications in the treatment of the diseases caused by ROS. Further studies are needed to confirm in vivo anti-tumorgenicity and subsequent chemical characterization of the active molecule(s).	a. precatorius retinoblastoma cancer
1	The jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) fruit: a review of current knowledge of fruit composition and health benefits.The nutritional jujube ( Ziziphus jujube Mill.) fruit belonging to the Rhamnaceous family grows mostly in Europe, southern and eastern Asia, and Australia, especially the inland region of northern China. Jujube has a long history of usage as a fruit and remedy. The main biologically active components are vitamin C, phenolics, flavonoids, triterpenic acids, and polysaccharides. Recent phytochemical studies of jujube fruits have shed some light on their biological effects, such as the anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antiobesity, immunostimulating, antioxidant, hepatoprotective, and gastrointestinal protective activities and inhibition of foam cell formation in macrophages. A stronger focus on clinical studies and phytochemical definition of jujube fruits will be essential for future research efforts. This review may be useful for predicting other medicinal uses and potential drug or food interactions and may be beneficial for people living where the jujube fruits are prevalent and health care resources are scarce.	jujube vitamin c
1	Structures of new phenylbutanoids and nitric oxide production inhibitors from the rhizomes of Zingiber cassumunar.The methanolic (MeOH) extract from the rhizomes of Zingiber cassumunar showed nitric oxide (NO) production inhibitory effects induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mouse peritoneal macrophages. From the MeOH extract, six new phenylbutanoids, phlains I-VI, were isolated together with 16 known constituents. The structures of new phenylbutanoids were determined on the basis of physicochemical and chemical evidence. In addition, the inhibitory effects of the principal constituents on the NO production were examined. Among them, phlain III (IC50=24 microM), (E)-1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)buta-1,3-diene (69 microM), (E)-1-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)buta-1,3-diene (83 microM), and cassumunaquinone 1 (47 microM) were found to show the inhibitory effects.	zingiber cassumunar (E)-1-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)buta-1,3-diene
1	Inhibitory effects of flavonoids from Abelmoschus manihot flowers on triglyceride accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.The 95% EtOH extract from the flowers of Abelmoschus manihot (L.) Medic showed inhibitory activity on TG accumulation in 3T3-L1 preadipocyte. Chemical studies on the active fraction led to the isolation of 14 flavonoids (1-14). To clarify the multi-mechanism of the isolates on preadipocyte differentiation, the levels of TG and FFA and the related role transcription factors (PPARgamma, CEBP/alpha, and ap2) expression were evaluated. At the concentration of 30 muM, compounds 1-6 and 10-14 showed inhibitory activity on TG accumulation significantly in mature 3T3-L1 cells. 1, 2, 4-7, 9, 10, 13, and 14 reduced the level of FFA. At the molecular level, the mRNA expressions of PPARgamma, CEBP/alpha, and ap2 were down-regulated by compounds 1, 5, 9, 12, 13; 1-8, 10-14; and 1-4, 6, 8-12, 14, respectively. The structure-activity relationships of the 14 flavonoids were also discussed.	abelmoschus manihot flavonoids

2	Histochemical localization of glycoconjugates on microglial cells in Alzheimer's disease brain samples by using Abrus precatorius, Maackia amurensis, Momordica charantia, and Sambucus nigra lectins.Four lectins (Abrus precatorius (APA), Maackia amurensis (MAA), Momordica charantia (MCA) and Sambucus nigra (SNA)) have been used to identify glycohistochemically the microglial cells (MGC) activation in autoptic brain samples from Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects. Three of these lectins (APA, MAA and MCA) have utilized as microglial cell markers for the first time. The identification of new markers for the study of MGC is very important to better understand the role of these type of cells in the metabolic/dismetabolic control of betaA4 in AD which still represents a vexata questio.	sambucus nigra AD
1	Cinnamaldehyde protects against oxidative stress and inhibits the TNF-alpha-induced inflammatory response in human umbilical vein endothelial cells.Oxidative stress and inflammation play critical roles in the development of cardiovascular diseases. Cinnamaldehyde (CA) is a natural compound from Cinnamomum cassia, and its anticancer, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities have been widely investigated. In the present study, the cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of CA on H2O2- or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-exposed human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were examined. CA and its natural derivative, 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde (MCA), markedly increased the cellular protein level of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and promoted the translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) to the nucleus. CA-mediated Nrf2/HO-1 activation protected the HUVECs from H2O2-induced oxidative stress, which promotes apoptosis. HO-1 depletion by siRNA attenuated the CA-mediated cell protective effects against oxidative stress. Additionally, CA markedly inhibited the adhesion of U937 monocytic cells to HUVECs by decreasing the expression level of vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM-1). An in vivo experiment confirmed the anti-inflammatory effects of CA, as lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory cell infiltration was effectively inhibited by the compound. Overall, these observations suggest that CA may be used as a therapeutic agent for oxidative stress-mediated cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis.	cinnamomum cassia Cinnamaldehyde

Their structures were elucidated by means of spectroscopic techniques including 2D NMR experiments. All the isolated compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Some compounds showed significant inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 with MIC values ranging from 12.5 to 50 mug/mL.	zanthoxylum capense 6-acetonyldihydrochelerythrine
2	Antiasthmatic related properties of Abrus precatorius leaves on various models.OBJECTIVE: Asthma is a multifaceted inflammatory disorder which results into narrowing of airway with broncho-constriction and spasm. As the complex pathophysilogy of asthma, various animal models are generally used to investigate the immunological and physiological pathogenesis of disease. Abrus precatorius Linn (Fabacease) is a climbing shrub. The leaves and roots are sweet in taste and traditionally used for the treatment of asthma, bronchititis, and inflammation. A. precatorius possesses different pharmacological activities. Hence the objective of this study was to evaluate antiasthmatic activity of ethanol extract of A. precatorius leaves using various models. METHODS: In present study ethanol extract of A. precatorius leaves was evaluated for antiasthmatic activity using carrageenan induced paw edema in rats [100-150 mg/kg], histamine induced bronchospasm in guinea pig [200-400 mg/kg] and histamine induced contraction of goat tracheal chain [2.5-25 mug/ml]. RESULTS: Result of study revealed that ethanol extract of A. precatorius significantly exhibited anti-inflammatory effects in rats, oral treatment of extract on guinea pig significantly increases histamine induced preconvulsive dysponea times and the ethanol extract of plant increases got tracheal chain precontracted with histamine. CONCLUSION: Hence present study concludes that ethanol extract of A. precatorius possesses antiasthmatic activity.	a. precatorius spasm
1	Tyrosinase-inhibitory constituents from the twigs of Cinnamomum cassia.A methanol extract of the twigs of Cinnamomum cassia was found to possess inhibitory activity against tyrosinase. Purification of the MeOH extract afforded four new phenolics, cassiferaldehyde (6), icariside DC (9), cinnacassinol (10), and dihydrocinnacasside (13), together with 10 known compounds (1-5, 7-12, and 14). The structures of the new compounds were determined by spectroscopic data interpretation. Compounds 1-6 and 8-13 showed strong inhibitory activity against tyrosinase, with IC(50) values ranging from 0.24 to 0.94 mM.	cinnamomum cassia cinnacassinol
2	Zanthoxylum fruit extract from Japanese pepper promotes autophagic cell death in cancer cells.Zanthoxylum fruit, obtained from the Japanese pepper plant (Zanthoxylum piperitum De Candolle), and its extract (Zanthoxylum fruit extract, ZFE) have multiple physiological activities (e.g., antiviral activity). However, the potential anticancer activity of ZFE has not been fully examined. In this study, we investigated the ability of ZFE to induce autophagic cell death (ACD). ZFE caused remarkable autophagy-like cytoplasmic vacuolization, inhibited cell proliferation, and ultimately induced cell death in the human cancer cell lines DLD-1, HepG2, and Caco-2, but not in A549, MCF-7, or WiDr cells. ZFE increased the level of LC3-II protein, a marker of autophagy. Knockdown of ATG5 using siRNA inhibited ZFE-induced cytoplasmic vacuolization and cell death. Moreover, in cancer cells that could be induced to undergo cell death by ZFE, the extract increased the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and the JNK inhibitor SP600125 attenuated both vacuolization and cell death. Based on morphology and expression of marker proteins, ZFE-induced cell death was neither apoptosis nor necrosis. Normal intestinal cells were not affected by ZFE. Taken together, our findings show that ZFE induces JNK-dependent ACD, which appears to be the main mechanism underlying its anticancer activity, suggesting a promising starting point for anticancer drug development.

2	Effect of the herbal medicine dai-kenchu-to on gastrointestinal motility in patients with megacystis-microcolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIHS) and chronic idiopathic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIIP): report of two cases.Dai-kenchu-to (DKT), a traditional Japanese herbal medicine (Kampo medicine), composed of zanthoxylum fruit, ginseng root, dried ginger rhizome and malt sugar, is clinically effective for postoperative ileus and chronic constipation. MMIHS and CIIP are severe motility disorder associated with high morbidity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of DKT on functional intestinal obstruction. DKT was clinically effective for gastrointestinal motility in a case with MMIHS, but not effective in one with CIIP. MMIHS and CIIP are speculated to have different pathogenesis regarding gastrointestinal pseudo-obstruction based upon the effect of this drug.	ginseng gastrointestinal pseudo-obstruction
1	[Effect of flavonoids from Abelmoschus manihot on proliferation, differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocyte and insulin resistance].Abelmoschus manihot was rich in flavonoids, which has been reported the activity on protecting angiocarpy and improving renal function. This study aimed to explore the action mechanism of five flavonoids from A. manihot on how to ameliorating insulin resistance through the regulation of the glucose and expression of PPARgamma, C/EBPalpha, SREBP-1, resistin, visfatin, adiponectin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. After the 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were differentiated into mature adipocytes, insulin resistance model was built. Insulin resistance adipocytes were treated with 5, 100 mumol L-1 quercetin, isoquercitrin, hyperoside, quercitrin-3'-O-glucoside, gossypetin-8-O-beta-glucoside. The glucose was indirectly determined by BCA kit. The mRNA expression levels of PPARgamma, C/EBPalpha, SREBP-1, resistin, visfatin, adiponectin were detected by real-time quantitative PCR. Results showed that five flavonoids at 5 mumol L-1 could accelerate preadipocytes proliferation and inhibit that at 100 mumol L-1 Compared with the normal group, glucose uptake reduced significantly in model group (P&lt;0.01). With the treatment of five flavonoids at 100 mumol L-1, glucose consumption increased significantly (P&lt;0.01). The high expression of PPARgamma, C/EBPalpha, adiponectin expression was significantly increased (P&lt;0.01), and low expression of SREBP-1, resistin, visfatin after respective administration with five flavonoids at 100 mumol L-1 promoted adipocyte differentiation. This study showed that, HY, JY, QT, QG, GG can control preadipocytes proliferation, promote adipocyte differentiation and regulate the expression of relative factors with lipid metabolism, such as PPARgamma, C/EBPalpha, SREBP-1, adiponectin, resistin, visfatin, increasing glucose utilization and improving insulin resistance in 3T3-L1 adipocyte.	a. manihot hyperoside
1	Acaricidal properties of the essential oil from Zanthoxylum caribaeum against Rhipicephalus microplus.Zanthoxylum caribaeum Lamarck (Rutaceae) is plant species with a variety of medical applications, including insecticidal activity. This study determined the bioacaricidal activity of the essential oil from Z. caribaeum leaves against engorged Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus (Canestrini, 1887) females using the adult immersion test. For this purpose, three serial concentrations (5.0, 2.5, and 1.25%, vol:vol, in 1% dimetilsulfoxide) of the essential oil were used. Essential oil 5% caused 65% mortality on the first day after treatment, 85% on the second day, and 100% mortality by the fifth day. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the acaricidal activity of the essential oil from Z. caribaeum leaves against cattle ticks.	z. caribaeum essential oil
2	Inhibition of Trypanosoma cruzi by plant extracts used in Chinese medicine.In this work, we assessed the effect of extracts obtained from 17 plants used in traditional Chinese medicine. These extracts were tested in vitro with the epimastigote form of Trypanosoma cruzi, clone Bra C(15) C(2), at 27 degrees C in F-29 medium at a concentration of 100 microg/ml in axenic cultures. Allopurinol was used as reference drug. Seven plant extracts showed inhibitory activities lower than 25%. Pueraria lobata, Mahonia beaei, Dictamus dasycarpus, Kochia scoparia, Sophora flavescens and Ligustrum lucidum showed effects with inhibition values between 25% and 60%, whereas Lithospermum erythrorhizon, Saussurea lappa, Melia toosendan and Cinnamomum cassia showed the greatest inhibitory activity of 100%. The IC(50) of these extracts were: 0.4, 2.4, 1.8 and 3.9 microg/ml, respectively. The MTT assay was made and did not show cytotoxic activity. These results allowed us to suggest that L. erythrorhizon, S. lappa, M. toosendan and C. cassia could be a source of new compounds against T. cruzi.	c. cassia inhibitory activities
3	Nrf2-dependent suppression of azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium-induced colon carcinogenesis by the cinnamon-derived dietary factor cinnamaldehyde.The progressive nature of colorectal cancer and poor prognosis associated with the metastatic phase of the disease create an urgent need for the development of more efficacious strategies targeting colorectal carcinogenesis. Cumulative evidence suggests that the redox-sensitive transcription factor Nrf2 (nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2), a master regulator of the cellular antioxidant defence, represents a promising molecular target for colorectal cancer chemoprevention. Recently, we have identified cinnamon, the ground bark of Cinnamomum aromaticum (cassia cinnamon) and Cinnamomum verum (Ceylon cinnamon), as a rich dietary source of the Nrf2 inducer cinnamaldehyde (CA) eliciting the Nrf2-regulated antioxidant response in human epithelial colon cells, conferring cytoprotection against electrophilic and genotoxic insult. Here, we have explored the molecular mechanism underlying CA-induced Nrf2 activation in colorectal epithelial cells and have examined the chemopreventive potential of CA in a murine colorectal cancer model comparing Nrf2(+/+) with Nrf2(-/-) mice. In HCT116 cells, CA caused a Keap1-C151-dependent increase in Nrf2 protein half-life via blockage of ubiquitination with upregulation of cytoprotective Nrf2 target genes and elevation of cellular glutathione. After optimizing colorectal Nrf2 activation and target gene expression by dietary CA-supplementation regimens, we demonstrated that CA suppresses AOM/DSS-induced inflammatory colon carcinogenesis with modulation of molecular markers of colorectal carcinogenesis. Dietary suppression of colorectal cancer using CA supplementation was achieved in Nrf2(+/+) but not in Nrf2(-/-) mice confirming the Nrf2 dependence of CA-induced chemopreventive effects. Taken together, our data suggest feasibility of colorectal cancer suppression by dietary CA, an FDA-approved food additive derived from the third most consumed spice in the world.	cinnamaldehyde colorectal cancer
2	Immunological response in mice bearing LM3 breast tumor undergoing pulchellin treatment.BACKGROUND: Ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIP) have been studied in the search for toxins that could be used as immunotoxins for cancer treatment. Pulchellin, a type 2 RIP, is suggested to induce immune responses that have a role in controlling cancer. METHODS: The percentage of dendritic cells and CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in the spleen (flow cytometry), cytokines' release by PECs and splenocytes (ELISA) and nitric oxide production by PECs (Griess assay) were determined from tumor-bearing mice injected intratumorally with 0.1 ml of pulchellin at 0.75 mug/kg of body weight. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test. RESULTS: Pulchellin-treated mice showed significant immune system activation, characterized by increased release of IFN-gamma and Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10), while IL-6 and TGF-beta levels were decreased. There was also an increase in macrophage's activation, as denoted by the higher percentage of macrophages expressing adhesion and costimulatory molecules (CD54 and CD80, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that pulchellin is promising as an adjuvant in breast cancer treatment.	pulchellin breast cancer
1	Lectin receptors on IgA isotypes.It has been shown previously that secretory IgA interacts with the mannose-specific lectin of Escherichia coli. The purpose of the study described here was to evaluate whether the N-linked oligosaccharide chains of the human IgA isotypes IgA1 and IgA2 differ in lectin receptor activity. A range of plant lectins specific for N-linked oligosaccharide chains were tested for their ability to precipitate IgA1 and IgA2 myeloma proteins, secretory IgA and free secretory component. IgA2 myeloma proteins reacted more strongly than IgA1 with the mannose-specific lectin ConA, whereas IgA1 myeloma proteins reacted more strongly than IgA2 with two galactose-specific lectins, Ricinus communis agglutinin I and Abrus precatorius agglutinin. This suggests that IgA2 possesses a larger proportion of short truncated complex type oligosaccharide chains and/or oligomannose type chains than IgA1. Further, IgA2 reacted more strongly than IgA1 myeloma proteins with Lens culinaris (lentil) lectin, and Pisum sativum (pea) lectin, suggesting that IgA2 exposes more of short, complex type chains fucosylated on the core than IgA1. The differences demonstrated in receptor activity between IgA1 and IgA2 may be important in their interaction with the microbial flora, as well with endogenous lectins, such as phagocyte receptors.	abrus precatorius oligosaccharide
3	3-O-trans-p-coumaroyl-alphitolic acid, a triterpenoid from Zizyphus jujuba, leads to apoptotic cell death in human leukemia cells through reactive oxygen species production and activation of the unfolded protein response.3-O-trans-p-coumaroyl-alphitolic acid (3OTPCA), a triterpenoid isolated from the plant Zizyphus jujuba (ZJ), is known to be cytotoxic to cancer cells; however, the molecular mechanism underlying 3OTPCA-induced cell death remains unknown. Here, we provide novel evidence that 3OTPCA induces apoptotic cell death in human leukemia cells. We found that 3OPTCA induces DNA fragmentation within 24 h after treatment in U937 cells, which was also observed in other leukemia cell lines, including Molt-4 and Jurkat cells. We then investigated other parameters involved in apoptosis, including phosphatidylserine externalization and caspase-3 cleavage in U937 cells treated with 3OTPCA. 3OTPCA caused significant DNA fragmentation, annexin-V binding, and caspase-3 cleavage, indicating that 3OTPCA exerts cytotoxicity through apoptosis induction. RNA-seq analysis revealed that the expression of transcripts associated with the unfolded protein response (UPR), such as spliced XBP-1 and CHOP, were up-regulated by 3OTPCA treatment. 3OTPCA-induced UPR activation may be due to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress because both 3OTPCA and thapsigargin, an endoplasmic Ca2+ transport ATPase inhibitor, increased intracellular calcium levels. 3OTPCA down-regulated the expression of Bcl-2, a target of CHOP, and led to the loss of the mitochondrial membrane, indicating that the intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptotic pathway was triggered by 3OTPCA, likely through UPR activation. Furthermore, we found that 3OTPCA induced superoxide anion generation and, following p38 MAPK phosphorylation, caspase-8 cleavage without affecting Fas expression. It also induced subsequent Bid cleavage, which may enhance the apoptosis triggered by the intrinsic pathway. These findings reveal for the first time that 3OTPCA induces apoptotic cell death through the generation of reactive oxygen species and activation of UPR.	3-o-trans-p-coumaroyl-alphitolic acid leukemia
1	Seasonal variation in the leaf essential oil composition of Zanthoxylum clava-herculis growing in Huntsville, Alabama.The seasonal variation in the chemical composition of the leaf essential oil of Zanthoxylum clava-herculis has been analyzed by GC-MS. Three individual trees were sampled four times during the course of the 2004 growing season. Notable differences were recorded in the essential oil yields from the three trees on the four collection dates; yields were highest in May and lowest in July. The leaf essential oils were made up of 25 components, largely menthane monoterpenoids, dominated by limonene (44-73%) and 1,8-cineole (16-43%), with lesser amounts of alpha-thujene, linalool, gamma-terpinene, and alpha-terpineol. The ratio of oxygenated monoterpenoids to monoterpene hydrocarbons generally increased during the season, largely reflected in the 1,8-cineole/limonene ratio.	zanthoxylum clava-herculis linalool
1	A New Megastigmane Sesquiterpenoid from Zanthoxylum Schinifolium Sieb. et Zucc.Zanthoxylum schinifolium Sieb. et Zucc. (Rutaceae), a dioecious shrub with hooked prickly branches, has been used as folk medicine for the treatment of the common cold, stomach ache, diarrhea, and jaundice in China, Korea, and Japan. In our phytochemical investigations on this genus, a new megastigmane sesquiterpenoid, which is referred to as schinifolenol A (1), was isolated from Z. schinifolium. The stereochemistry was characterized via the analyses of extensive spectra. The absolute configuration was established by the application of a modified Mosher's experiment and assisted by a time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) on calculated electronic circular dichroism (ECD). Bioactivity screenings showed that compound 1 exhibited a safe hypotoxicity and a better selectivity on anti-Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpes virus (KSHV). 	z. schinifolium megastigmane
4	Suppression of plasminogen activators and the MMP-2/-9 pathway by a Zanthoxylum avicennae extract to inhibit the HA22T human hepatocellular carcinoma cell migration and invasion effects in vitro and in vivo via phosphatase 2A activation.This study shows that the ECM degradation-associated pathway, including uPA and tPA and the downstream MMP-2/-9 protein, was significantly suppressed in HA22T cells treated with a Zanthoxylum avicennae extract (YBBE). The endogenous inhibitors, including TIMP-1/-2 and PAI-1, were enhanced in HA22T cells by the YBBE treatment. The expression of MMP-2/-9 and TIMP-1/-2 was respectively assessed by using RT-PCR and a zymography assay. The mRNA levels and enzymatic activity of MMP-2/-9 were down-regulated by the YBBE treatment in a dose-dependent manner, while the TIMP-1/-2 levels were conversely markedly increased. The PP2A siRNA or PP2A inhibitor totally reversed the YBBE effects, confirming the essential role of PP2A in YBBE inhibiting the HA22T cell migration and invasion effects. Xenografted animal experiments on nude mice demonstrated similiar results to the in vitro system. Both the in vitro and in vivo models clearly demonstrate that YBBE inhibited the highly metastatic HA22T liver cancer cell migration and invasion effects through PP2A activation.

4	Nitidine chloride induces apoptosis and inhibits tumor cell proliferation via suppressing ERK signaling pathway in renal cancer.Nitidine chloride (NC), a natural bioactive alkaloid derived from Zanthoxylum nitidum (Roxb) DC, has been shown to have inhibitory effects on various tumors. However, whether NC could exert anti-cancer activity and the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated in renal cancer cells. In this study, we demonstrated the growth inhibitory and pro-apoptotic effects of NC on renal cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. With cell viability and flow cytometric apoptosis assays, we found that NC potently suppressed the growth of 786-O and A498 cells in a time- and dose- dependent manner. Consistently, the xenograft model performed in nude mice exhibited reduced tumor growth with NC treatment. Mechanically, we presented that NC significantly decreased phosphorylation of ERK and Akt, accompanied by up-regulation of P53, Bax, cleavage caspase-3 and cleavage PARP, downregulation of Bcl-2, caspase-3 and PARP. Furthermore, a specific MEK inhibitor, PD98059, could potentiate the pro-apoptotic effects of NC, which indicated that NC might trigger apoptosis in renal cancer cells partly via inhibition of ERK activity. Taken together, our results imply that NC could be developed as a potential anticancer agent to renal cancer and worthy of further studies. 	ERK renal cancer
1	Green and Efficient Processing of Cinnamomum cassia Bark by Using Ionic Liquids: Extraction of Essential Oil and Construction of UV-Resistant Composite Films from Residual Biomass.There is significant interest in the development of a sustainable and integrated process for the extraction of essential oils and separation of biopolymers by using novel and efficient solvent systems. Herein, cassia essential oil enriched in coumarin is extracted from Cinnamomum cassia bark by using a protic ionic liquid (IL), ethylammonium nitrate (EAN), through dissolution and the creation of a biphasic system with the help of diethyl ether. The process has been perfected, in terms of higher biomass dissolution ability and essential oil yield through the addition of aprotic ILs (based on the 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium (C4 mim) cation and chloride or acetate anions) to EAN. After extraction of oil, cellulose-rich material and free lignin were regenerated from biomass-IL solutions by using a 1:1 mixture of acetone-water. The purity of the extracted essential oil and biopolymers were ascertained by means of FTIR spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, and GC-MS techniques. Because lignin contains UV-blocking chromophores, the oil-free residual lignocellulosic material has been directly utilized to construct UV-light-resistant composite materials in conjunction with the biopolymer chitosan. Composite material thus obtained was processed to form biodegradable films, which were characterized for mechanical and optical properties. The films showed excellent UV-light resistance and mechanical properties, thereby making it a material suitable for packaging and light-sensitive applications.	cinnamomum cassia coumarin
0	Total flavone of Abelmoschus manihot ameliorates Crohn's disease by regulating the NF-kappaB and MAPK signaling pathways.Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic relapsing form of inflammatory bowel disease, and its pathogenesis remains unknown. Total flavone of Abelmoschus manihot L. Medic (TFA), has been used as anti-inflammatory and myocardial ischemia protective drug. The present study aimed to explore the effects of TFA on CD and its underlying mechanism. We reported that TFA comprises eight flavone glycosides, including quercetin-3-O-robinobioside, gossypetin-3-O-glucoside, quercetin-3'-O-glucoside, isoquercetin, hyperoside, myricetin, gossypetin and quercetin. In vivo, TFA promoted the survival of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in mice, decreased weight loss and increased colon length in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, TFA notably ameliorated the inflammatory response in mice with TNBS-induced colitis as determined by histopathological analysis. In addition, the administration of TFA in mice with TNBS-induced colitis led to a significant decrease in the levels of cytokines in the sera and colon tissues; a significant decrease myeloperoxidase activity in the colon tissues was also observed. These findings may be associated with the suppression of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. In vitro, TFA significantly downregulated the expression of cytokines in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 cells. In addition, TFA suppressed LPS-induced activation of the NF-kappaB and MAPK signaling pathways in RAW264.7 cells. Our findings indicated that TFA could suppress the inflammatory response in mice with TNBS-induced colitis via inhibition of the NF-kappaB and MAPK signaling pathways. The results of the present study may improve understanding of the function of TFA and provide a novel theoretical basis for the treatment of CD.	flavone NF-kappaB
1	Estimation of Bioactive Compound, Maslinic Acid by HPTLC, and Evaluation of Hepatoprotective Activity on Fruit Pulp of Ziziphus jujuba Mill. Cultivars in India.Fruits of Ziziphus jujuba Mill. (family: Rhamnaceae), known as Indian jujube or "Ber," are of potential nutritional and medicinal value. The objectives of the present study were to estimate bioactive compound maslinic acid by HPTLC method and to evaluate in vitro antioxidant and hepatoprotective activity of eight cultivars of Indian jujube. Maslinic acid and the fruit pulp of various cultivars of Indian jujube, namely, Gola, Sannur, Umaran, Mehrun, and Chhuhara, exhibited significantly high antioxidant and hepatoprotective activity. HPTLC-densitometric method was developed for quantification of maslinic acid from fruits of Indian jujube cultivars. The trend of occurrence of maslinic acid in fruits pulp extracts was as follows: Gola &gt; Sannur &gt; Umaran &gt; Mehrun &gt; Chhuhara &gt; Wild &gt; Kadaka &gt; Apple. A significant correlation was shown by maslinic acid content and prevention of oxidative stress induced by CCl4 in liver slice culture cell treated with extract. Maslinic acid along with its other phytoconstituents like phenols, flavonoids, and ascorbic acid may act as a possible therapeutic agent for preventing hepatotoxicity caused by oxidative stress generated due to the prooxidants like CCl4. This is the first report of fruit pulp extracts of Z. jujube cultivars in India and maslinic acid preventing CCl4 induced damage in liver slice culture cell of mice. 	jujube maslinic acid
1	[GC-MS analysis and cytotoxic activity of the supercritical extracts from roots and stems of Zanthoxylum nitidum].The volatile components of roots and stems of Zanthoxylum nitidum were investigated by supercritical fluid carbon dioxide extraction (SFE-CO2) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry(GC-MS). Thirty-one and fifty-one compounds were identified in the supercritical extracts from roots and stems of Z. nitidum, respectively, and total twenty-seven compounds were the common constituents. Among them, the major constituents in root and stem supercritical extracts were spathulenol (18.49 and 26.18%), n-hexadecanoic acid (14.24% and 12.79%), ar-tumerone (6.95% and 8.88%), oleic acid (8.39% and 5.71%) and hexanoic acid (4.39% and 7.78%). The in-vitro MTT assay showed that the volatile components of roots and stems of Z. nitidum did not exhibited any cytotoxic activity against human cancer Huh-7 and normal IEC-6 cells. These results indicated the same nature of the volatile constituents in the root and stem of Z. nitidum. This investigation may provide further evidence for expansion of medicinal parts of Z. nitidum.	z. nitidum hexanoic acid
1	Antinociceptive activity of Rhoifoline A from the ethanol extract of Zanthoxylum nitidum in mice.AIM OF THE STUDY: Antinociceptive activity of Rhoifoline A (RA), a benzophenanthridine alkaloid obtained from the ethanol extract of Zanthoxylum nitidum, was evaluated in mice using chemical and thermal models of nociception. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RA was evaluated on anti-nociceptive activity in mice using chemical and thermal models of nociception. RESULTS: RA administered intraperitoneally at doses of 10, 20, 40 and 80 mg/kg exhibited significant inhibitions on chemical nociception induced by intraperitoneal acetic acid and subplantar formalin, and on thermal nociception in the tail-flick test and the hot plate test. RA neither significantly impaired motor coordination in the rotarod test nor did spontaneous locomotion in the open-field test. RA did not enhance the pentobarbital sodium induced sleep time. These results indicated that the observed antinociceptive activity of RA was unrelated to sedation or motor abnormality. Core body temperature measurement showed that RA did not affect temperature during a 2-hour period. Furthermore, RA-induced antinociception in the hot plate test was insensitive to naloxone or glibenclamide but significantly antagonized by L-NAME, methylene blue and nimodipine. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, it is reasonable that the analgesic mechanism of RA possibly involved the NO-cGMP signaling pathway and L-type Ca(2+) channels.	zanthoxylum nitidum RA
2	Anti-plasmodial activity and toxicity of extracts of plants used in traditional malaria therapy in Meru and Kilifi Districts of Kenya.The methanol and aqueous extracts of 10 plant species (Acacia nilotica, Azadirachta indica, Carissa edulis, Fagaropsis angolensis, Harrissonia abyssinica, Myrica salicifolia, Neoboutonia macrocalyx, Strychnos heningsii, Withania somnifera and Zanthoxylum usambarensis) used to treat malaria in Meru and Kilifi Districts, Kenya, were tested for brine shrimp lethality and in vitro anti-plasmodial activity against chloroquine-sensitive and chloroquine-resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum (NF54 and ENT30). Of the plants tested, 40% of the methanol extracts were toxic to the brine shrimp (LD(50)&lt;100micro/ml), while 50% showed in vitro anti-plasmodial activity (IC(50)&lt;100microg/ml). The methanol extract of the stem bark of N. macrocalyx had the highest toxicity to brine shrimp nauplii (LD(50) 21.04+/-1.8microg/ml). Methanol extracts of the rest of the plants exhibited mild or no brine shrimp toxicity (LD(50)&gt;50microg/ml). The aqueous extracts of N. macrocalyx had mild brine shrimp toxicity (LD(50) 41.69+/-0.9microg/ml), while the rest were lower (LD(50)&gt;100microg/ml). The methanol extracts of F. angolensis and Zanthoxylum usambarense had IC(50) values &lt;6microg/ml while the aqueous ones had values between 6 and 15microg/ml, against both chloroquine-sensitive and resistant P. falciparum strains. The results support the use of traditional herbs for anti-malarial therapy and demonstrate their potential as sources of drugs.	f. angolensis toxicity
4	Antiproliferative Activity of Cinnamomum cassia Constituents and Effects of Pifithrin-Alpha on Their Apoptotic Signaling Pathways in Hep G2 Cells.Cinnamaldehyde (Cin), cinnamic acid (Ca) and cinnamyl alcohol (Cal), major constituents of Cinnamomum cassia, have been shown to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer and other activities. In this study, our aim was to evaluate the antiproliferative activity of these compounds in human hepatoma Hep G2 cells and examine the effects of pifithrin-alpha (PFTalpha; a specific p53 inhibitor) on their apoptotic signaling transduction mechanism. The antiproliferative activity was measured by XTT assay. Expression of apoptosis-related proteins was detected by western blotting. Results showed that at a concentration of 30 muM, the order of antiproliferative activity in Hep G2 cells was Cin &gt; Ca &gt; Cal. Cin (IC(50) 9.76 +- 0.67 muM) demonstrated an antiproliferative potency as good as 5-fluorouracil (an anti-cancer drug; IC(50) 9.57 +- 0.61 muM). Further studies on apoptotic mechanisms of Cin showed that it downregulated the expression of Bcl-(XL), upregulated CD95 (APO-1), p53 and Bax proteins, as well as cleaving the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in a time-dependent pattern. PFTalpha pre-incubation significantly diminished the effect of Cin-induced apoptosis. It markedly upregulated the anti-apoptotic (Bcl-(XL)) expression and downregulated the pro-apoptotic (Bax) expression, as well as effectively blocking the CD95 (APO-1) and p53 expression, and PARP cleavage in Cin-treated cells. This study indicates that Cin was the most potent antiproliferative constituent of C. cassia, and its apoptotic mechanism in Hep G2 cells could be mediated through the p53 induction and CD95 (APO-1) signaling pathways.	p53 hepatoma hep
1	Antiviral effect of flavonol glycosides isolated from the leaf of Zanthoxylum piperitum on influenza virus.The ethanol extract of Zanthoxylum piperitum (L.) DC. showed in vitro antiviral activity against influenza A virus. Three flavonol glycosides were isolated from the EtOAc fraction of Z. piperitum leaf by means of activity-guided chromatographic separation. Structures of isolated compounds were identified as quercetin 3-O-beta-D-galactopyranoside (1), quercetin 3-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside (2), kaempferol 3-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside (3) by comparing their spectral data with literature values. The anti-influenza viral activity of isolates was evaluated using a plaque reduction assay against influenza A/NWS/33 (H1N1) virus. The compounds also were subjected to neuraminidase inhibition assay in influenza A/NWS/33 virus. Compounds 1-3 exhibited antiviral activity against an influenza A virus in vitro, and inhibited the neuraminidase activity at relatively high concentrations. 	z. piperitum kaempferol 3-o-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside
2	Novel Phage Display-Derived Anti-Abrin Antibodies Confer Post-Exposure Protection against Abrin Intoxication.Abrin toxin is a type 2 ribosome inactivating glycoprotein isolated from the seeds of Abrus precatorius (jequirity pea). Owing to its high toxicity, relative ease of purification and accessibility, it is considered a biological threat agent. To date, there is no effective post-exposure treatment for abrin poisoning and passive immunization remains the most effective therapy. However, the effectiveness of anti-abrin monoclonal antibodies for post-exposure therapy following abrin intoxication has not been demonstrated. The aim of this study was to isolate high affinity anti-abrin antibodies that possess potent toxin-neutralization capabilities. An immune scFv phage-display library was constructed from an abrin-immunized rabbit and a panel of antibodies (six directed against the A subunit of abrin and four against the B subunit) was isolated and expressed as scFv-Fc antibodies. By pair-wise analysis, we found that these antibodies target five distinct epitopes on the surface of abrin and that antibodies against all these sites can bind the toxin simultaneously. Several of these antibodies (namely, RB9, RB10, RB28 and RB30) conferred high protection against pulmonary intoxication of mice, when administered six hours post exposure to a lethal dose of abrin. The data presented in this study demonstrate for the first time the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies in treatment of mice after pulmonary intoxication with abrin and promote the use of these antibodies, one or several, for post-exposure treatment of abrin intoxication.	abrus precatorius pulmonary intoxication
1	Chemical composition and antibacterial activities of the essential oil from Abies koreana.The essential oils from an alpine needle leaf of Abies koreana, which is a species native to Korea, was obtained by hydrodistillation with 0.9% (v/w) yield and analysed by GC and GC-MS. Sixty-eight constituents, accounting for more than 95.9% of the total oil composition, were identified. The main compounds with concentrations higher than 3% were borneol (27.9%), alpha-pinene (23.2%), beta-pinene (5.8%), terpinene-4-ol (3.8%), bornyl acetate (3.4%) and alpha-terpineol (3.1%). The antibacterial activity of the oil was evaluated against nine microorganisms using disc diffusion and broth microdilution methods. The essential oil exhibited some broad spectrum antibacterial activity against the tested organisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.	abies koreana alpha-pinene
4	Deacetylation of LAMP1 drives lipophagy-dependent generation of free fatty acids by Abrus agglutinin to promote senescence in prostate cancer.Therapy-induced senescence in cancer cells is an irreversible antiproliferative state, which inhibits tumor growth and is therefore a potent anti-neoplastic mechanism. In this study, low doses of Abrus agglutinin (AGG)-induced senescence through autophagy in prostate carcinoma cells (PC3) and inhibited proliferation. The inhibition of autophagy with 3-methyl adenine reversed AGG-induced senescence, thus confirming that AGG-triggered senescence required autophagy. AGG treatment also led to lipophagy-mediated accumulation of free fatty acids (FFAs), with a concomitant decrease in the number of lipid droplets. Lalistat, a lysosomal acid lipase inhibitor, abrogated AGG-induced lipophagy and senescence in PC3 cells, indicating that lipophagy is essential for AGG-induced senescence. The accumulation of FFAs increased reactive oxygen species generation, a known facilitator of senescence, which was also reduced in the presence of lalistat. Furthermore, AGG upregulated silent mating type information regulator 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1), while the presence of sirtinol reduced autophagy flux and the senescent phenotype in the AGG-treated cells. Mechanistically, AGG-induced cytoplasmic SIRT1 deacetylated a Lys residue on the cytoplasmic domain of lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1), an autolysosomal protein, resulting in lipophagy and senescence. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a novel SIRT1/LAMP1/lipophagy axis mediating AGG-induced senescence in prostate cancer cells.	SIRT1 prostate cancer
2	Effect of the herbal medicine dai-kenchu-to on gastrointestinal motility in patients with megacystis-microcolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIHS) and chronic idiopathic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIIP): report of two cases.Dai-kenchu-to (DKT), a traditional Japanese herbal medicine (Kampo medicine), composed of zanthoxylum fruit, ginseng root, dried ginger rhizome and malt sugar, is clinically effective for postoperative ileus and chronic constipation. MMIHS and CIIP are severe motility disorder associated with high morbidity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of DKT on functional intestinal obstruction. DKT was clinically effective for gastrointestinal motility in a case with MMIHS, but not effective in one with CIIP. MMIHS and CIIP are speculated to have different pathogenesis regarding gastrointestinal pseudo-obstruction based upon the effect of this drug.	ginger constipation
1	Purification and characterization of a novel type i ribosome inactivating protein, pachyerosin, from Pachyrhizus erosus seeds, and preparation of its immunotoxin against human hepatoma cells.Pachyrhizus erosus seeds have a high protein content and are used in China due to their cytotoxic effect. Here we report the biological and pharmacological activity of the protein extracts from P. erosus seeds. A novel ribosome-inactivating protein, pachyerosin, from P. erosus seeds was successively purified to homogeneity using ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE-sepharose FF, and Sephacryl S-200. Pachyerosin showed to be a type I ribosome-inactivating protein with a molecular mass of 29 kDa and an isoelectric point of 9.19. It strongly inhibited protein synthesis of rabbit reticulocyte lysate with an IC50 of 0.37 ng/mL and showed N-glycosidase activity on rat liver ribosomes with an EC50 of 85.9 pM. The N-terminal 27 amino acids of pachyerosin revealed a 60.71% sequence identity with abrin A from the seeds of Abrus precatorius. With the aim of targeting the delivery of pachyerosin, immunotoxin was prepared by conjugating pachyerosin with anti-human AFP monoclonal antibodies SM0736. The immunotoxin pachyerosin-SM0736 efficiently inhibited the growth of the human hepatoma cell line HuH-7 with an IC50 of 0.050 +- 0.004 nM, 2360 times lower than that of pachyerosin and 430 times lower than that of the immunotoxin against human gastric cancer cell line SGC7901. These results imply that pachyerosin may be used as a new promising anticancer agent.	abrus precatorius pachyerosin
1	Coumarin and cinnamaldehyde in cinnamon marketed in Italy: a natural chemical hazard?Some plants that are processed into foods often contain natural substances that may be hazardous to human health. One example is coumarin, which is known to cause liver and kidney damage in rats, mice and probably humans. The main source of coumarin in the diet is cinnamon. The name 'cinnamon' is correctly used to refer to Ceylon cinnamon, also known as 'true cinnamon'. However, other plant species are sometimes sold with the label of cinnamon. This is the case of Cinnamomun aromaticum (cassia). In recent years, due to its cheaper price, cassia is replacing true cinnamon in the European food market being largely used in the preparation of some kinds of sweets. Several European health agencies have recently warned against consuming high amounts of cassia due to its high content of coumarin. In this study, 34 samples of cinnamon and 50 samples of cinnamon-containing foodstuffs were collected from the Italian market. Quantitative determinations of coumarin and cinnamaldehyde were performed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with diode array detector (DAD). The analytical method was in-house validated assessing recovery, repeatability, linearity, limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ). The results showed that about 51% of cinnamon samples consisted of cassia, 10% were probably a blend of cassia and Ceylon cinnamon, whereas only 39% were actually Ceylon cinnamon. As far as cinnamon-containing foods are concerned, the samples often exceeded the maximum level fixed in the European Flavourings Directive of 2 mg kg(-1).	cinnamon cinnamaldehyde
1	Application of microdialysis for elucidating the existing form of hyperoside in rat brain: comparison between intragastric and intraperitoneal administration.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort) is an important anti-depressant herb used in clinic and commonly prescribed for mild depression. Hyperoside is one of the major components of H. perforatum and is also detected in many plant species such as Abelmoschus manihot, Black Currant, Rosa agrestis, Apocynum venetum and Nelumbo nucifera. AIM OF THE STUDY: As the hyperoside showed CNS (central nervous system) protective activity (e.g. anti-depressant-like effect), the possibility of hyperoside or its metabolites to reach CNS should be investigated. Moreover, the pharmacokinetics profile of hyperoside or its metabolites in rat brain should be studied for further elucidating the mechanism of hyperoside action on CNS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A simple method for simultaneous determination of unbound hyperoside and its metabolite 3'-O-methyl-hyperoside in rat brain was developed by using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) and microdialysis technique. This method was applied for pharmacokinetics study of hyperoside and 3'-O-methyl-hyperoside in rat brain after intragastric (i.g.) and intraperitoneally (i.p.) administration of hyperoside in vivo. RESULTS: Results showed that neither hyperoside nor its metabolites were detected in rat brain after i.g. administration but both compounds could be detected after i.p. administration. Considering the activity of hyperoside through both i.g. and i.p. administration, our results imply that the active components of hyperoside in vivo might be different. Therefore, further studies are needed to identify the active components of hyperoside in vivo through these two different routes. Moreover, non-oral administration route (e.g., i.p.) should be further investigated and be explored to obtain higher bioavailability and better activity for hyperoside. Our results also showed that the real existing form of hyperoside in rat brain were hyperoside and its methylated metabolite with maximum concentration to be 63.78 ng/mL and 24.66 ng/mL after 20mg/kg i.p. administration, respectively. Therefore, a more reasonable concentration of hyperoside should be considered in in vitro assay to reflect the real situation of hyperoside concentration in vivo. CONCLUSION: Due to the wide use of herbal remedies containing hyperoside, our investigation will contribute to further clarifying the action of this substance. Moreover, this method will be applied for clinical pharmacokinetics study of hyperoside and its metabolite as well as herbs that contain hyperoside.	nelumbo nucifera hyperoside
2	In vitro anti-Helicobacter pylori action of 30 Chinese herbal medicines used to treat ulcer diseases.Infection by Helicobacter pylori has been ascertained to be an important etiologic impetus leading usually to chronic active gastritis and gastric ulcer with growing incidences worldwide. Utilizing as the test pathogen a standard and five clinic strains of Helicobacter pylori, the antibacterial action was assessed in vitro with ethanol extracts of 30 Chinese herbal medicines which have been frequently prescribed since ancient times for treating gastritis-like disorders. Among the 30 tested materials, the ethanol extracts of Abrus cantoniensis (Fabaceae), Saussurea lappa (Asteraceae) and Eugenia caryophyllata (Myrtaceae) were strongly inhibitory to all test strains (MICs: approximately 40 microg/ml), and Hippophae rhamnoides (Elaeagnaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii (Liliaceae), Magnolia officinalis and Schisandra chinensis (Magnoliaceae), Corydalis yanhusuo (Papaveraceae), Citrus reticulata (Rutaceae), Bupleurum chinense and Ligusticum chuanxiong (Apiaceae) substantially active with MICs close to 60.0 microg/ml. As to antibacterial actions of the aqueous extracts of the same drugs, those derived from Cassia obtusifolia (Fabaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii and Eugenia caryophyllata were remarkably inhibitory against all the six Helicobacter pylori strains (MICs: approximately 60 microg/ml). The work compared almost quantitatively the magnitude of the anti-Helicobacter pylori actions of the 30 most prescribed gastritis-treating Chinese herbal drugs, and located as well some source plants where potent anti-Helicobacter pylori phytochemicals could be characterized.	fritillaria thunbergii gastritis
1	Fumigant toxicity of cassia and cinnamon oils and cinnamaldehyde and structurally related compounds to Dermanyssus gallinae (Acari: Dermanyssidae).The toxicity of two cassia oils, four cinnamon oils and (E)-cinnamaldehyde and (E)-cinnamic acid and 34 structurally related compounds to adult Dermanyssus gallinae (De Geer) collected from a poultry house was examined using a vapour-phase mortality bioassay. Results were compared with those of dichlorvos, a conventional acaricide. The cassia and cinnamon oils (cinnamon technical, cinnamon #500, cassia especial, cassia true, cinnamon bark and cinnamon green leaf) exhibited good fumigant toxicity (LD(50), 11.79-26.40 mug cm(-3)). alpha-Methyl-(E)-cinnamaldehyde (LD(50), 0.45 mug cm(-3)) and (E)-cinnamaldehyde (0.54 mug cm(-3)) were the most toxic compounds and the toxicity of these compounds was comparable to that of dichlorvos (0.30 mug cm(-3)). Potent fumigant toxicity was also observed in allyl cinnamate, ethyl-alpha-cyanocinnamate, (E)-2-methoxylcinnamic acid and (Z)-2-methoxylcinnamic acid (LD(50), 0.81-0.92 mug cm(-3)). Structure-activity relationships indicate that structural characteristics, such as types of functional groups and carbon skeleton rather than vapour pressure parameter, appear to play a role in determining toxicity. The essential oils and compounds described merit further study as potential acaricides for the control of D. gallinae populations as fumigants with contact action due to global efforts to reduce the level of highly toxic synthetic acaricides in the agricultural environment.	cinnamon essential oils
1	Methyl cinnamate inhibits adipocyte differentiation via activation of the CaMKK2-AMPK pathway in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes.Methyl cinnamate, an active component of  Zanthoxylum armatum , is a widely used natural flavor compound with antimicrobial and tyrosinase inhibitor activities. However, the underlying bioactivity and molecular mechanisms of methyl cinnamate on adipocyte function and metabolism remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effect of methyl cinnamate on adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Methyl cinnamate markedly suppressed triglyceride accumulation associated with down-regulation of adipogenic transcription factor expression, including sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha). Additionally, methyl cinnamate-inhibited PPARgamma activity and adipocyte differentiation were partially reversed by the PPARgamma agonist troglitazone. Furthermore, methyl cinnamate stimulated Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CaMKK2) and phospho-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) expression during adipogenesis. This study first revealed methyl cinnamate has antiadipogenic activity through mechanisms mediated, in part, by the CaMKK2-AMPK signaling pathway in 3T3-L1 cells.	zanthoxylum armatum methyl cinnamate
1	Effect of drying of jujubes (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) on the contents of sugars, organic acids, alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene, and phenolic compounds.This study investigated the changes in sugars, organic acids, alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene, phenolic profiles, total phenolic content (TPC), and antioxidant capacity of jujube fruits after four drying treatments (sun-, oven-, microwave- and freeze-drying). Sugar, organic acid, phenolic compounds, alpha-tocopherol, and beta-carotene were qualitatived and quantitatived by high-performance liquid chromatography. The TPC and antioxidant activity of jujube samples were evaluated using the Folin-Ciocalteau method and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical scavenging activity, respectively. Freeze-drying resulted in jujubes with higher antioxidant activity and was also a good choice for the preparation of beta-carotene from jujubes for the food industry. Microwave-dried jujubes had a higher content of protocatechuic acid, catechin, and epicatechin and maintained the same antioxidant capacity with the freeze-dried jujubes. The combination of microwave- and freeze-drying may be an efficient alternative with shorter processing time and, consequently, less impact on the nutritional value of the jujube.	jujube Sugar
3	Cinnamaldehyde inhibits the tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced expression of cell adhesion molecules in endothelial cells by suppressing NF-kappaB activation: effects upon IkappaB and Nrf2.The production of adhesion molecules and subsequent attachment of leukocytes to endothelial cells (ECs) are critical early events in atherogenesis. These adhesion molecules thus play an important role in the development of this disease. Recent studies have highlighted the chemoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of cinnamaldehyde, a Cinnamomum cassia Presl-specific diterpene. In our current study, we have examined the effects of both cinnamaldehyde and extracts of C. cassia on cytokine-induced monocyte/human endothelial cell interactions. We find that these compounds inhibit the adhesion of TNFalpha-induced monocytes to endothelial cells and suppress the expression of the cell adhesion molecules, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, at the transcriptional level. Moreover, in TNFalpha-treated ECs, the principal downstream signal of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, NF-kappaB, was also found to be abolished in a time-dependent manner. Interestingly, cinnamaldehyde exerts its anti-inflammatory effects by blocking the degradation of the inhibitory protein IkappaB-alpha, but only in short term pretreatments, whereas it does so via the induction of Nrf2-related genes, including heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1), over long term pretreatments. Treating ECs with zinc protoporphyrin, a HO-1 inhibitor, partially blocks the anti-inflammatory effects of cinnamaldehyde. Elevated HO-1 protein levels were associated with the inhibition of TNFalpha-induced ICAM-1 expression. In addition to HO-1, we also found that cinnamaldehyde can upregulate Nrf2 in nuclear extracts, and can increase ARE-luciferase activity and upregulate thioredoxin reductase-1, another Nrf2-related gene. Moreover, cinnamaldehyde exposure rapidly reduces the cellular GSH levels in ECs over short term treatments but increases these levels after 9 h exposure. Hence, our present findings indicate that cinnamaldehyde suppresses TNF-induced singling pathways via two distinct mechanisms that are activated by different pretreatment periods.	cinnamaldehyde tumor necrosis
1	Comparison of the sedative and hypnotic effects of flavonoids, saponins, and polysaccharides extracted from Semen Ziziphus jujube.Semen Ziziphus jujube (SZJ), the seeds of Ziziphus jujuba Mill. var. spinosa, is a kind of traditional Chinese medicine used for its action on insomnia. In order to analyze the effective component, we investigated and compared the sedative and hypnotic effects of three kinds of compounds, flavonoids, saponins, and polysaccharides. Flavonoids, saponins, and polysaccharides were extracted from SZJ and orally administered to mice separately at 17 g kg(-1) per day for certain days before animal tests. Spontaneous motility and coordinated movement tests were used to observe the effects of the three kinds of compounds on the mouse behavior, and sodium barbital-induced sleeping time of mouse were tested to analyze the effects of the three kinds of compounds on the sleep of mouse. Results show that flavonoids and saponins caused a significant reduction of walking time and coordinated movement ability of mouse, significantly prolonged its sleeping time at 40 mg kg(-1), ip, subthreshold dose and increased the sleeping number of animals at 50 mg kg(-1), ip, superthreshold dose induced by coeliac injection of sodium barbital. Polysaccharides did not show any significance in all animal tests. Comparative analysis showed that saponins had a more effective sedative and hypnotic function than that of flavonoids, polysaccharides did not show a sedative and hypnotic effect.	ziziphus jujuba mill. var saponins
1	Differentiating parts of Cinnamomum cassia using LC-qTOF-MS in conjunction with principal component analysis.Cinnamon bark (Rou Gui in Chinese), cinnamon twig (Gui Zhi) and shaved cinnamon bark (Gui Sin) have been widely used as spices and in traditional Chinese medicine since ancient times. On-going issues related to quality and authenticity necessitate the development of analytical methods capable of providing an objective evaluation of samples. In this study, chemical fingerprints of cinnamon bark, cinnamon twigs and shaved cinnamon bark were established using liquid chromatography quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometry in conjunction with principal component analysis (PCA). From 125 samples of cinnamon, we identified the following eight compounds and their the detection ratios: coumarin, cinnamaldehyde, cinnamyl alcohol, cinnamic acid, 2-hydroxycinnamaldehyde, 2-hydroxycinnamic acid, 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde and 4-methoxycinnamaldehyde. Of these, 4-methoxycinnamaldehyde presented the largest variations in detection ratio, making up 64.0, 97.4 and 50.0% in cinnamon bark, cinnamon twig, and shaved cinnamon bark, respectively. The quantities of cinnamyl alcohol, coumarin and cinnamaldehyde also varied between the three parts of the plant. Chemical fingerprints of the three cinnamon samples were established using principal component analysis, the results of which indicate that cinnamon bark and shaved cinnamon bark could be easily differentiated, despite a marked similarity in outward appearance. Cinnamon twig was also shown to depart from the other clusters. The proposed method provides a fast and efficient means of identifying cinnamon herbs for quality control purposes.

2	The essential oils from Zanthoxylum schinifolium pericarp induce apoptosis of HepG2 human hepatoma cells through increased production of reactive oxygen species.The volatile extract from dried pericarp of Zanthoxylum schinifolium that was obtained by simultaneous distillation with dichloromethane and water was composed of 29.9% geranyl acetate, 15.8% citronella, 15.4% sabinene and the minor volatile components included beta-myrcene, linalool, (-)-isopulegol, citronellyl acetate, 1,4-dimethyl pyrazole, alpha-terpinene, 3-methyl-6-(1-methylethyl)-2-cyclo-hexene-1-o1 and trans-geraniol. The volatile extract decreased the cell viability and induced apoptotic death in HepG2 human hepatoma cells in a concentration- and time-related manner. In addition, the volatile extract increased the production of reactive oxygen species in a dose-dependent manner. Pretreatment of the cells with Trolox, a well-known antioxidant, significantly suppressed the generation of reactive oxygen species and cell death induced by the extract. However, caspase-3 activity was not changed in the extract-treated cells, suggesting that the extract-induced apoptosis of HepG2 cells is caspase-3 independent. Furthermore, in nude mice inoculated with Huh-7 human hepatoma cells, the extract significantly inhibited tumor development. These results suggest that the volatile extract from Zanthoxylum schinifolium pericarpium is a good candidate for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) therapy and that reactive oxygen species are the key signaling molecules in the volatile extract-induced cell death in HepG2 cells.	zanthoxylum schinifolium hepatocellular carcinoma
1	Inhibitory effect of Zanthoxylum bungeanum seed oil on ovalbumin-induced lung inflammation in a murine model of asthma.The present study aimed to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of Zanthoxylum bungeanum seed oil (Z. seed oil) to alleviate airway inflammation in asthmatic mice. The asthmatic mice were treated with vehicle, ovalbumin (OVA), or OVA + Z. seed oil (2 g/kg) for between 24 h and 14 days. Following treatment, inflammatory cell infiltration and pulmonary tissue damage were assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining, and immunohistochemistry. The expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules and mitogen activated protein kinase signaling proteins were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, reverse transcription quantitative-polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. In asthmatic mice, administration of Z. seed oil attenuated lung tissue injury and airway remodeling, and inhibited the infiltration of leukocytes and eosinophils into the airway by reducing the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines compared with OVA-treated mice (P&lt;0.05). Z. seed oil also reduced the levels of inflammatory chemokine and adhesion molecules via downregulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and activation of c-JUN N-terminal kinase in the Z. seed-treated mice compared with OVA-treated mice (P&lt;0.05). Thus, data from the present study indicates that Z. seed oil can suppress pulmonary inflammation and tissue injury during asthma, and suggests that it may be used to effectively treat allergen-induced asthma. 	zanthoxylum bungeanum z. seed oil
1	Cinnamomum cassia extract promotes thermogenesis during exposure to cold via activation of brown adipose tissue.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Cinnamomum cassia (L.) J.Presl (Lauraceae), a widely used traditional Chinese medicine, is well known to exert hot property. It is recorded as dispelling cold drug in ancient Chinese monographs, such as Synopsis of golden chamber published in Han dynasty. According to Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2015), Cinnamomum cassia (L.) J.Presl (Cinnamon) has the functions of dispersing cold, relieving pain, warming meridians and promoting blood circulation. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of Cinnamon extract (CE) on cold endurance and the mechanism of thermogenesis activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The improving effect of hypothermia were evaluated with body temperature by infrared camera and multi-thermo thermometer. In vivo, the thermogenic effect was observed with energy metabolism and substrate utilization. The activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) was evaluated with the histomorphology and expression of thermogenic protein. In vitro, the uncoupling effects on mitochondrial was evaluated with Seahorse and fluorescent staining. The mechanism of thermogenesis was explored in brown adipocyte. RESULTS: The body temperature and energy expenditure were significantly increased by CE administration in cold environment. In morphology, lipid droplets were reduced and the number of mitochondrial was increased. CE significantly increased the non-shivering thermogenesis via upregulating the expression of thermogenic protein. In vitro, the uncoupling effect was obviously along with the decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production. It was confirmed that the thermogenesis effect was induced via lipolysis and energy metabolism. In addition, CE also alleviated myocardium injury in the morphology in cold environment. Moreover, the major constituent was identified as (1) coumarin, (2) cinnamic acid, (3) cinnamaldehyde and (4) 2-methoxy cinnamaldehyde. CONCLUSIONS: The mechanism of improving cold tolerance was related to lipolysis and activation of BAT. Meanwhile, we provided a kind of potential prevention methods for cold injury.	cinnamomum cassia cinnamaldehyde
2	Effect of a mixed herb-enriched diet on the innate immune response and disease resistance of Paralichthys olivaceus against Philasterides dicentrarchi infection.We investigated the effect of a mixed herb-enriched diet obtained from pomegranate Punica granatum, Dalmatian chrysanthemum Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium, and mastic-leaved prickly-ash Zanthoxylum schinifolium on innate immune mechanisms (e.g., phagocytosis activity, respiratory burst activity, alternative complement activity, lysozyme activity, and disease resistance) of olive flounder Paralichthys olivaceus against the scuticociliate Philasterides dicentrarchi. All experimental groups were challenged with P. dicentrarchi (1 x 10(5) ciliates/mL) through intraperitoneal administration of the pathogen (50 microL) on day 1. On day 7, the infected groups were fed 0, 5, 50, and 100 mg/kg of the enriched diets. The innate immune parameters, cumulative mortality, and relative percent survival (RPS) were assessed at weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4. Administration of 50 or 100 mg/kg of the herbal-enriched diet enhanced immunity throughout the experimental period. However, at the 5-mg/kg dosage, the enriched diet did not enhance the innate immune estimates at any time. At doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg, administration of the diet preceding the challenge with P. dicentrarchi decreased the percentage cumulative mortality in the experimental groups and thereby increased RPS values. This study reports that administration of 50 or 100 mg/kg mixed herbal-enriched diet could positively influence the innate immune response to P. dicentrarchi and enhance the health status of olive flounder with respect to this microbe.	olive flounder dicentrarchi infection
1	The Effect of Plant Additives on the Stability of Polyphenols in Dried Black Chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa) Fruit.Chokeberry fruit exhibits a high level of pro-health potential, associated with a significant amount of polyphenol content and antioxidant activity. The fruit is easily perishable and therefore needs to be processed in short order to ensure its availability throughout the year. For this purpose, the fruit is dried, which has an impact on the preservation of bioactive components such as polyphenols. In the study, chokeberry fruit was influenced by a suspension of spices, including clove and cinnamon, and subsequently dried using the freeze-drying, convection, and microwave radiation methods. Freeze-drying was concluded to be the most desirable method of drying, which preserves the largest amount of polyphenols while soaking fruit in a suspension of cinnamon or cloves accelerated the loss of anthocyanins during the storage period. The obtained test results may constitute a valuable source of information for manufacturers in designing new products with increased pro-health potential, whose properties result from the high content of polyphenols and other plant additives.	cinnamon anthocyanins
3	Antinociceptive and antioxidant activity of Zanthoxylum budrunga wall (Rutaceae) seeds.Different parts of the medicinal plant Zanthoxylum budrunga Wall enjoy a variety of uses in ethnobotanical practice in Bangladesh. In the present study, a number of phytochemical and pharmacological investigations were done on the ethanol extract of Z. budrunga seeds (ZBSE) to evaluate its antinociceptive and antioxidant potential. ZBSE was also subjected to HPLC analysis to detect the presence of some common antioxidants. In acetic acid induced writhing test in mice, ZBSE showed 65.28 and 74.30% inhibition of writhing at the doses of 250 and 500 mg/kg and the results were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.001). In hot-plate test, ZBSE raised the pain threshold significantly (P &lt; 0.001) throughout the entire observation period. In DPPH scavenging assay, the IC50 of ZBSE was observed at 82.60 mug/mL. The phenolic content was found to be 338.77 mg GAE/100 g of dried plant material. In reducing power assay, ZBSE showed a concentration dependent reducing ability. HPLC analysis indicated the presence of caffeic acid with a concentration of 75.45 mg/100 g ZBSE. Present investigation supported the use of Zanthoxylum budrunga seed in traditional medicine for pain management. Constituents including caffeic acid and other phenolics might have some role in the observed activity.	caffeic acid pain
2	Efficacy and safety of Abelmoschus manihot for IgA nephropathy: A multicenter randomized clinical trial.RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVE: IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is an important cause for end-stage renal disease worldwide. The treatment for IgAN remains challenging, and few randomized and controlled clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate new therapies. The present study assesses the efficacy and safety of Abelmoschus manihot (AM) in IgAN patients. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized, non-inferiority, double-blind, double-dummy multicenter trial. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This trial was designed to recruit 1,600 biopsy-proven IgAN patients (proteinuria between 0.5-3.0 g/d and estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] of >= 45 ml/min/1.73 m2) across China. INTERVENTIONS: The participants were randomized at 1:1 to AM (2.5 g for three times per day) or losartan potassium (100 mg per day) for 48 weeks. OUTCOMES: The primary outcome was the change in 24-hour proteinuria from baseline to week 48. The secondary outcomes were the change in eGFR from baseline to week 48, and the incidents of endpoint events (proteinuria >= 3.5 g/24 h, doubling of serum creatinine, or receiving renal replacement treatment). RESULTS: Among 1,470 randomized patients (mean age, 37.4 [SD, 10.6] years old; 777 [52.9%] were female; mean eGFR, 95.0 [SD, 24.3] mL/min/1.73 m2; mean 24-hour proteinuria, 1.2 [SD, 0.7] g/d), the mean decline in 24-h proteinuria at week 48 was 230 mg and 253 mg in the AM and losartan potassium groups, respectively (P = 0.676). The mean difference in the change in 24-h proteinuria between these two groups was -23.32 mg (95% confident interval: -123.2 to 76.6, p = 0.647). The mean decline in eGFR was 0.41 ml/min/1.73 m2 and 0.76 ml/min/1.73 m2 in the AM and losartan potassium groups, respectively (p = 0.661). The mean difference in the change in eGFR between these two groups was -0.43 ml/min/1.73 m2 (95% confident interval: -1.99 to 1.13, p = 0.589). The incidence of endpoint events was 8.6% in the AM group and 8.2% in the losartan group (p = 0.851). LIMITATIONS: The results of the trial may not be generalized to IgAN patients with a proteinuria of > 3.0 g/d and an eGFR of < 45 ml/min/1.73 m2. The long-term benefits of AM in reducing the risk of progressive renal dysfunction remains unclear, based on this 48-week observation. CONCLUSION: AM can be recommended as a promising treatment for IgAN patients.	abelmoschus manihot renal dysfunction
1	Components and insecticidal activity against the maize weevils of Zanthoxylum schinifolium fruits and leaves.In our screening program for new agrochemicals from Chinese medicinal herbs and wild plants, Zanthoxylum schinifolium essential oils were found to possess strong insecticidal activity against the maize weevil Sitophilus zeamais. The essential oils of Z. schinifolium fruits and leaves were extracted via hydrodistillation and investigated by GC and GC-MS. Estragole (69.52%) was the major compound of the essential oil of fresh fruits, followed by linalool (8.63%) and limonene (4.34%) and 94.33% of the total components were monoterpenoids. The main components of the essential oil of fresh leaves were linalool (12.94%), ar-tumerone (8.95%), limonene (6.45%) and elixene (5.43%) and only 50.62% were monoterpenoids. However, the essential oil from purchased fruits contained linalool (33.42%), limonene (13.66%) and sabinene (5.72%), followed by estragole (4.67%), nerol (4.56%) and 4-terpineol (4.27%). Estragole, linalool and sabinene were separated and purified by silica gel column chromatography and preparative thin layer chromatography, and further identified by means of physicochemical and spectrometric analysis. The essential oil from the fresh fruits (LD50 = 15.93 mug/adult) possessed two times more toxicity to the insects compared with that of fresh leaves (LD50 = 35.31 mug/adult). Estragole, linalool and sabinene exhibited contact activity against S. zeamais with LD50 values of 17.63, 13.90 and 23.98 mug/adult, respectively. The essential oils of Z. schinifolium possessed strong fumigant toxicity against S. zeamais adults with LC50 values of 13.19 mg/L (fresh fruits), 24.04 mg/L (fresh leaves) and 17.63 mg/L (purchased fruits). Estragole, linalool and sabinene also exhibited strong fumigant toxicity against the maize weevils with LC50 values of 14.10, 10.46 and 9.12 mg/L, respectively.	maize weevils essential oils
1	Cinnamomum cassia Suppresses Caspase-9 through Stimulation of AKT1 in MCF-7 Cells but Not in MDA-MB-231 Cells.BACKGROUND: Cinnamomum cassia bark is a popular culinary spice used for flavoring and in traditional medicine. C. cassia extract (CE) induces apoptosis in many cell lines. In the present study, particular differences in the mechanism of the anti-proliferative property of C. cassia on two breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, were elucidated. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The hexane extract of C. cassia demonstrated high anti-proliferative activity against MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells (IC50, 34 +- 3.52 and 32.42 +- 0.37 mug/ml, respectively). Oxidative stress due to disruption of antioxidant enzyme (SOD, GPx and CAT) activity is suggested as the probable cause for apoptosis initiation. Though the main apoptosis pathway in both cell lines was found to be through caspase-8 activation, caspase-9 was also activated in MDA-MB-231 cells but suppressed in MCF-7 cells. Gene expression studies revealed that AKT1, the caspase-9 suppressor, was up-regulated in MCF-7 cells while down-regulated in MDA-MB-231 cells. Although, AKT1 protein expression in both cell lines was down-regulated, a steady increase in MCF-7 cells was observed after a sharp decrease of suppression of AKT1. Trans-cinnamaldehyde and coumarin were isolated and identified and found to be mainly responsible for the observed anti-proliferative activity of CE (Cinnamomum cassia). CONCLUSION: Activation of caspase-8 is reported for the first time to be involved as the main apoptosis pathway in breast cancer cell lines upon treatment with C. cassia. The double effects of C. cassia on AKT1 gene expression in MCF-7 cells is reported for the first time in this study.	c. cassia coumarin
2	HPLC method for measurement of human salivary alpha-amylase inhibition by aqueous plant extracts.Control of hyperglycemia is an important treatment in metabolic disorders such as type II diabetes and obesity. alpha-Amylase, as the first enzyme of glucose release from dietary polysaccharides, is a potential target to identify new sources of novel anti-obesity and anti-diabetic drugs. In this work, different herbal extracts as alpha-amylase inhibitors were studied by measuring the rate of the cleavage of a maltooligomer substrate 2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl-beta-D-maltoheptoside. Measurement of chromophore containing products after reversed phase HPLC separation was used for alpha-amylase activity measurement. Rates of hydrolysis catalysed by human salivary alpha-amylase were determined in the presence and absence of lyophilised water extracts of eleven herbs. Remarkable bioactivities were found for extracts of Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume (bark), Camellia sinensis L. (leaf), Ribes nigrum L. (leaf), Laurus nobilis L. (leaf), Vaccinium macrocarpon Aiton (fruit) and Syzygium aromaticum L. (bud). Determined IC50 values were in 0.017-41 mug/ml range for these six selected plant extracts. Our results confirm the applicability of this HPLC-based method for the quick and reliable comparison of plants as alpha-amylase inhibitors.	camellia sinensis l type ii diabetes
2	Antioxidant and antiproliferative activities of Abrus precatorius leaf extracts--an in vitro study.BACKGROUND: The use of traditional medicine at the primary health care level is widespread and plant-based treatments are being recommended for curing various diseases by traditional medical practitioners all over the world. The phytochemicals present in the fruits, vegetables and medicinal plants are getting attention day-by-day for their active role in the prevention of several human diseases. Abrus precatorius is a widely distributed tropical medicinal plant with several therapeutic properties. Therefore in the present study, A. precatorius leaf extracts were examined for their antioxidant and cytotoxic properties in vitro in order to discover resources for new lead structures or to improve the traditional medicine. METHODS: In this study, antioxidant and antiproliferative properties of the different leaf extracts (hexane, ethyl acetate, ethanol and water) from A. precatorius were investigated along with the quantification of the polyphenol and flavonoid contents. The ability of deactivating free radicals was extensively investigated with in vitro biochemical methods like DPPH( ), ( )OH, NO, SO(2-) scavenging assays and inhibition capability of Fe(II)-induced lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, antiproliferative activities using different human cancer cell lines and primary cell line was carried out by MTT method. RESULTS: Total phenolic content and total flavonoid content of the extracts were found in the range of 1.65 +- 0.22 to 25.48 +- 0.62 GAE mg/g dw and 6.20 +- 0.41 to 17.16 +- 1.04 QE mg/g dw respectively. The experimental results further revealed that A. precatorius extracts showed strong antiradical properties, capable to chelate Fe(2+) and possess good inhibition ability of lipid peroxidation. In addition, as a first step towards the identification of phytoconstituents endowed with potent chemopreventive activities, we evaluated the inhibitory effects of A. precatorius extracts on the proliferation of four different human tumour cell lines such as human colon adenocarcinoma cells (Colo-205), human retinoblastoma cancer cells (Y79), human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2) and Leukemia cells (SupT1). Ethanol extract (APA) and ethyl acetate extract (APE) of A. precatorius had apparent capabilities of inhibiting the survival of tested human cancer cell lines. Moreover, it was observed that the A. precatorius extracts did not inhibit the growth of mice peritoneal macrophages, thus confirming that plants extracts are selective against the cancer cell lines. CONCLUSION: This work provides a scientific support for the high antioxidant and antiproliferative activity of this plant and thus it may find potential applications in the treatment of the diseases caused by ROS. Further studies are needed to confirm in vivo anti-tumorgenicity and subsequent chemical characterization of the active molecule(s).	a. precatorius colon adenocarcinoma
1	Repellency of Cinnamomum cassia bark compounds and cream containing cassia oil to Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) under laboratory and indoor conditions.Patch and skin bioassays were used in laboratory and indoor tests to evaluate the repellency of (E)-cinnamaldehyde, identified in Cinnamomum cassia Blume bark and essential oil, and a cream containing 5% (w/w) cassia oil against Aedes aegypti (L.) females. Results were compared with those of a known C. cassia compound cinnamyl alcohol, N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) and two commercial repellents: MeiMei cream containing citronella and geranium oils and Repellan S aerosol containing 19% DEET. In patch bioassay tests with A. aegypti females, (E)-cinnamaldehyde at 0.153 mg cm(-2) and DEET at 0.051 mg cm(-2) provided 93 and 89% protection at 40 min after exposure. In skin bioassay tests, (E)-cinnamaldehyde at 0.051 mg cm(-2) and DEET at 0.025 mg cm(-2) provided 87 and 95% protection at 30 min after application. (E)-Cinnamaldehyde was significantly more effective than cinnamyl alcohol in both bioassays. In indoor tests with four human volunteers, 5% cassia oil cream provided 94, 83 and 61% protection against A. aegypti females exposed for 30, 50 and 70 min after application respectively. Cassia oil cream was a slightly less effective repellent than MeiMei cream. Repellan S aerosol provided 91% repellency at 120 min after application. Products containing cassia oil merit further study as potential repellents for the protection of humans and domestic animals from blood-feeding vectors and the diseases they transmit.	c. cassia (E)-Cinnamaldehyde
0	Potent modulation of P-glycoprotein activity by naturally occurring phenylbutenoids from Zingiber cassumunar.Five phenylbutenoid derivatives from the rhizomes of Zingiber cassumunar Roxb. (Zingiberaceae) were evaluated for their P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitory effects in a P-gp over-expressing multidrug resistant (MDR) human breast cancer cell line, MCF-7/ADR. As a result, a phenylbutenoid dimer, (+/-)-trans-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-[(E)-3,4-dimethoxystyryl]cyclohex-1-ene (1), exhibited highly potent P-gp inhibitory activity, decreasing the IC(50) value of daunomycin (DNM) to 4.31 +/- 0.40 microm in the cells (DNM IC(50) = 37.1 +/- 0.59 microm). The positive control, verapamil decreased the IC(50) value of DNM to 6.94 +/- 0.40 microm. Three phenylbutenoid monomers, 2-4 from this plant, also resulted in a significant decrease in the IC(50) values of DNM compared with the control. In particular, compound 1 markedly enhanced [(3)H]-DNM accumulation and significantly reduced [(3)H]-DNM efflux compared with the control, and this effect was more potent than that of verapamil, a well-known P-gp inhibitor. These results suggest that compound 1 of Z. cassumunar can be developed as a potent chemo-sensitizing agent that reverses P-gp-mediated MDR in human cancer chemotherapy.	phenylbutenoid P-gp
2	Inhibition of Akt/mTOR/p70S6K Signaling Activity With Huangkui Capsule Alleviates the Early Glomerular Pathological Changes in Diabetic Nephropathy.Huangkui capsule (HKC), a Chinese modern patent medicine extracted from Abelmoschus manihot (L.) medic, has been widely applied to clinical therapy in the early diabetic nephropathy (DN) patients. However, it remains elusive whether HKC can ameliorate the inchoate glomerular injuries in hyperglycemia. Recently the activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/serine-threonine kinase (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and its downstream regulator, 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K), play important roles in the early glomerular pathological changes of DN including glomerular hypertrophy, glomerular basement membrane (GBM) thickening and mild mesangial expansion. This study thereby aimed to clarify therapeutic effects of HKC during the initial phase of DN and its underlying mechanisms. Fifteen rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: the normal group, the model group and the HKC group. The early DN model rats were induced by unilateral nephrectomy combined with intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin, and administered with either HKC suspension or vehicle after modeling and for a period of 4 weeks. Changes in the incipient glomerular lesions-related parameters in urine and blood were analyzed. Kidneys were isolated for histomorphometry, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and Western blotting (WB) at sacrifice. In vitro, murine mesangial cells (MCs) were used to investigate inhibitory actions of hyperoside (HYP), a bioactive component of HKC, on cellular hypertrophy-associated signaling pathway by WB, compared with rapamycin (RAP). For the early DN model rats, HKC ameliorated micro-urinary albumin, body weight and serum albumin, but had no significant effects on renal function and liver enzymes; HKC improved renal shape, kidney weight and kidney hypertrophy index; HKC attenuated glomerular hypertrophy, GBM thickening and mild mesangial expansion; HKC inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR and p70S6K, and the protein over-expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 in kidneys. In vitro, the phosphorylation of PI3K, Akt, mTOR and p70S6K in MCs induced by high-glucose was abrogated by treatment of HYP or RAP. On the whole, this study further demonstrated HKC safely and efficiently alleviates the early glomerular pathological changes of DN, likely by inhibiting Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling activity in vivo and in vitro, and provided the first evidence that HKC directly contributes to the prevention of the early DN.	abelmoschus manihot diabetic nephropathy
1	Extraction time and temperature affect the extraction efficiencies of coumarin and phenylpropanoids from Cinnamomum cassia bark using a microwave-assisted extraction method.Microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), an efficient extraction tool, was employed to extract a coumarin and five phenylpropanoids (cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, cinnamaldehyde, 2-hydroxycinnamadehyde, and 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde) from Cinnamomum cassia bark using water as the extraction solvent. Six marker compounds were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector using a validated analytical method. To investigate the influences of temperature and time on the extraction yields of the six marker compounds, the water extracts of C. cassia bark were prepared using a MAE method at six different extraction temperatures (70, 75, 80, 85, 90, and 95 C) and times (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12min). Their influences were assessed by multiple regression analysis. The results obtained demonstrated that higher extraction temperature and longer extraction time positively affected coumarin and cinnamyl alcohol contents, but negatively affected extract contents of cinnamic acid, cinnamaldehyde and 2-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (all p-&lt;0.05). The extraction of 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde was affected by both positively and negatively by increasing temperature and time. These changes during MAE were assumed by the chemical natures of the marker compounds with various functional groups. In conclusion, temperature and times significantly affected the extraction efficiencies of a coumarin and five phenylpropanoids from C. cassia bark when a water-based MAE method was used. This study provides a novel approach to the preparation of the water extract of C. cassia bark using MAE.	c. cassia phenylpropanoids
1	Identification of the potential active components of Abelmoschus manihot in rat blood and kidney tissue by microdialysis combined with ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry.In this paper, microdialysis combining with ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) was applied to simultaneously identify components in blood and kidney dialysis after oral administration of Abelmoschus manihot extract. Microdialysis probe was implanted in the jugular vein and the kidney medulla, respectively; microdialysis samples were collected continuously, transferred to microtubes and analyzed by UPLC-Q-TOF/MS. The components in microdialysis samples were separated by an UPLC HSS T3 column and eluted with acetonitrile and water (containing 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The results showed that unbound constituents in blood circulation of the rat include hyperoside, isoquercitrin, quercetin monoglucuronide, quercetin-3'-O-glucoside, quercetin, myricetin, and hibifolin while unbound constituents in kidney are hyperoside, isoquercitrin, quercetin monoglucuronide, which might be the potential active components in vivo. The developed method was simple and reliable, and could be adopted to rapidly screen and identify potential active components contributing to pharmacological effects of TCM and to better clarify its action mechanism.	abelmoschus manihot myricetin
3	Cinnamaldehyde induces apoptosis by ROS-mediated mitochondrial permeability transition in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells.Cinnamaldehyde is an active compound isolated from the stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia, a traditional oriental medicinal herb, which has been shown to inhibit tumor cell proliferation. In this study, we investigated the effects of cinnamaldehyde on the cytotoxicity, induction of apoptosis and the putative pathways of its actions in human promyelocytic leukemia cells. Using apoptosis analysis, measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and assessment of mitochondrial membrane potentials (DeltaPsim), we show that cinnamaldehyde is a potent inducer of apoptosis and that it transduces the apoptotic signal via ROS generation, thereby inducing mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) and cytochrome c release to the cytosol. ROS production, mitochondrial alteration, and subsequent apoptotic cell death in cinnamaldehyde-treated cells were blocked by the antioxidant N-acetylcystein. Taken together, our data indicate that cinnamaldehyde induces the ROS-mediated mitochondrial permeability transition and resultant cytochrome c release. This is the first report on the mechanism of the anticancer effect of cinnamaldehyde.	cinnamaldehyde leukemia
1	Potent antiplatelet, anti-inflammatory and antiallergic isoflavanquinones from the roots of Abrus precatorius.Five isoflavanquinones have been isolated from the roots of Abrus precatorius L. (Leguminosae). Three of them are new and designated as abruquinones D, E, and F. The pharmacological activities of the isoflavanquinones have been evaluated. The results indicated that abruquinones A, B, and D exhibited remarkable inhibitory effects on the platelet aggregation. The IC50 of abruquinones A and B for the inhibition of the platelet aggregation induced by arachidonic acid (AA) and collagen were less than 5 micrograms/ml, and of abruquinone D, was less than 10 micrograms/ml for that induced by AA. On the other hand, abruquinones A, B, D, and F showed strong anti-inflammatory and antiallergic effects. The IC50 of abruquinones A, B, D, and F for the inhibition of superoxide formation were less than 0.3 micrograms/ml, for the inhibition of the release of both beta-glucuronidase and lysozyme from rat neutrophils and the release of both beta-glucuronidase and histamine from mast cells were less than 1 microgram/ml.	abrus precatorius isoflavanquinones
1	Inhibitory effect of 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde on nitric oxide production through inhibition of NF-kappa B activation in RAW 264.7 cells.Cinnamomum cassia has been widely used for treating dyspepsia, gastritis, and inflammatory disease. In the present study, several of cinnamaldehyde derivatives were synthesized from various cinnamic acid based on the 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde isolated from the bark C. cassia Blume was investigated to compare their NO production and NF-kappa B activity from Raw 264.7 cell since nitric oxide (NO) and NF-kappa B have been shown to be implicated factors in the inflammatory disease. The results show that HCA, among the derivatives, most significantly inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NO production and NF-kappa B transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner with an IC(50) value of 8 and 22 microM, respectively. We next investigated putative possible mechanisms of inhibitory effect of HCA on NO production. The inhibition of NO by HCA was consistent with the inhibitory effect on LPS-induced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression. Moreover, HCA inhibited LPS-induced p50 and p65 translocation resulting in the inhibition of the DNA binding activity of the NF-kappa B, a central regulator of iNOS. The present results provided evidence that HCA, among cinnamaledhyde derivatives, has the most inhibitory effect on NO production through inhibition of NF-kappa B activation, and thus can be used as an anti-inflammatory agent.	c. cassia 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde
1	Silver Fir (Abies alba L.) Polyphenolic Extract Shows Beneficial Influence on Chondrogenesis In Vitro under Normal and Inflammatory Conditions.Several plant polyphenols have been shown to reduce osteoarthritis symptoms due to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. We investigated the effects of two different polyphenolic extracts (Belinal, Pycnogenol) and two different polyphenols (resveratrol, quercetin) on the chondrogenic potential of bone-derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) from healthy donors and patients with osteoarthritis. Our main aim was to determine whether Belinal, a commercially available polyphenolic extract from silver fir (Abies alba L.) branches, has comparable chondrogenic potential with the other tested extract and the polyphenols under inflammatory and non-inflammatory conditions. In our study, Belinal promoted significantly greater chondrogenesis compared to the untreated (p = 0.0289) and resveratrol-treated (p = 0.0468) MSCs from patients with hip osteoarthritis under non-inflammatory conditions. Under inflammatory conditions, chondrogenesis was significantly enhanced for MSCs treated with Belinal compared to the control (p = 0.0483). The other extract and the polyphenols did not show any significant effects on chondrogenesis under non-inflammatory or inflammatory conditions. None of the tested extracts and polyphenols showed significant effects on chondrogenesis in healthy donors, under either non-inflammatory or inflammatory conditions. Our data show that Belinal can boost the chondrogenesis of MSCs derived from patients with osteoarthritis, under both non-inflammatory and inflammatory conditions.	silver fir polyphenols
2	Evaluation of natural products on inhibition of inducible cyclooxygenase (COX-2) and nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in cultured mouse macrophage cells.The inhibitors of prostaglandin biosynthesis and nitric oxide production have been considered as potential anti-inflammatory and cancer chemopreventive agents. In this study, we evaluated approximately 170 methanol extracts of natural products including Korean herbal medicines for the inhibition of prostaglandin E(2) production (for COX-2 inhibitors) and nitric oxide formation (for iNOS inhibitors) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophages RAW264.7 cells. As a result, several extracts such as Aristolochia debilis, Cinnamomum cassia, Cinnamomum loureirii, Curcuma zedoaria, Eugenia caryophyllata, Pterocarpus santalius, Rehmania glutinosa and Tribulus terrestris showed potent inhibition of COX-2 activity (&gt;80% inhibition at the test concentration of 10 micro g/ml). In addition, the extracts of A. debilis, Caesalpinia sappan, Curcuma longa, C. zedoaria, Daphne genkwa and Morus alba were also considered as potential inhibitors of iNOS activity (&gt;70% inhibition at the test concentration of 10 micro g/ml). These active extracts mediating COX-2 and iNOS inhibitory activities are warranted for further elucidation of active principles for development of new cancer chemopreventive and/or anti-inflammatory agents.	c. zedoaria cancer
2	Nutraceutical composition of Zizyphus mauritiana Lamk (Indian ber): effect of enzyme-assisted processing.Zizyphus (Indian ber) is an excellent source of several phenolic compounds. The effect of two cell wall degrading enzymes, namely pectinase and viscozyme, on the nutraceutical composition of Zizyphus juice was investigated in the present study. Enzyme assisted processing significantly (P &lt; 0.05) improved the juice yield, total soluble solids, total phenolics and total antioxidant activity (AOX). There was significant increase in recovery of antioxidants, to the tune of 70.51%, 66%, and 45% respectively in ascorbic acid, total phenolics and total flavonoids through viscozyme. The in-vitro total AOX of juice extracted via enzyme-assisted processing was 20.9 and 15.59 mumol Trolox/ml in ferric-reducing antioxidant power and cupric-reducing antioxidant capacity assays, respectively. There was 41% increase in AOX of juice extracted with enzyme over straight pressed juice. Results indicate that enzyme-assisted processing can significantly improve the functional properties of the Zizyphus juice.	Zizyphus flavonoids
3	Total flavones of Abelmoschus manihot improve diabetic nephropathy by inhibiting the iRhom2/TACE signalling pathway activity in rats.CONTEXT: Total flavones extracted from Abelmoschus manihot L. (Malvaceae) medic (TFA) have been proven clinically effective at improving renal inflammation and glomerular injury in chronic kidney disease (CKD). OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the function of TFA as an inhibitor of iRhom2/TACE (tumour necrosis factor-alpha converting enzyme) signalling and investigated its anti-DN (diabetic nephropathy) effects in a DN rat model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vitro, cells were treated with 200 mug/mL advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and then co-cultured with 20 mug/mL TFA for 24 h. Real time PCR, western blotting and co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed. In vivo, DN was induced in 8 week old male Sprague-Dawley rats via unilateral nephrectomy and intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin, then TFA were administered to rats by gavage for 12 weeks at three different doses (300, 135 and 75 mg/kg/d). 4-Phenylbutanoic acid (2.5 mg/kg/d) was used as a positive control. RESULTS: IC50 of TFA is 35.6 muM in HK2 and 39.6 muM in HRMC. TFA treatment (20 muM) inhibited the activation of iRhom2/TACE signalling in cultured cells induced by AGEs. LD50&gt;26 g/kg and ED50=67 mg/kg of TFA in rat by gavage, TFA dose-dependently downregulated the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and exerted anti-inflammatory effects significantly though inhibiting the activation of iRhom2/TACE signalling. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that TFA could dose-dependently ameliorate renal inflammation by inhibiting the activation of iRhom2/TACE signalling and attenuating ER stress. These results suggest that TFA has potential therapeutic value for the treatment of DN in humans.	flavones diabetic nephropathy
0	Mechanisms of Action of Cassiae Semen for Weight Management: A Computational Molecular Docking Study of Serotonin Receptor 5-HT2C.Overweight and obesity is a growing global health concern. Current management of obesity includes lifestyle intervention, bariatric surgery and medication. The serotonin receptor, 5-HT2C, is known to mediate satiety, appetite and consumption behaviour. Lorcaserin, an appetite control drug, has demonstrated efficacy in appetite control by targeting 5-HT2C but causes undesirable side effects. This study aimed to explore the potential usage of Cassiae semen (CS), a well-known traditional Chinese medicine used to treat obesity. A computational molecular docking study was performed to determine the binding mechanism of CS compounds to the 5-HT2C receptors in both active, agonist-bound and inactive, antagonist-bound conformations. By comparing binding poses and predicted relative binding affinities towards the active or inactive forms of the receptor, we hypothesise that two of the CS compounds studied may be potent agonists which may mimic the appetite suppression effects of lorcaserin: obtusifoliol and cassiaside B2. Furthermore, two ligands, beta-sitosterol and juglanin, were predicted to bind favourably to 5-HT2C outside of the known agonist binding pocket in the active receptor, suggesting that such ligands may serve as positive allosteric modulators of 5-HT2C receptor function. Overall, this study proposed several CS compounds which may be responsible for exerting anti-obesity effects via appetite suppression by 5-HT2C receptor activation.	beta-sitosterol 5-HT2C
1	Amelioration of cyclophosphamide induced myelosuppression and oxidative stress by cinnamic acid.Cinnamic acid (C9H8O2), is a major constituent of the oriental Ayurvedic plant Cinnamomum cassia (Family: Lauraceae). This phenolic acid has been reported to possess various pharmacological properties of which its antioxidant activity is a prime one. Therefore it is rational to hypothesize that it may ameliorate myelosuppression and oxidative stress induced by cyclophosphamide, a widely used chemotherapeutic agent. Commercial cyclophosphamide, Endoxan, was administered intraperitoneally to Swiss albino mice (50mg/kg) pretreated with 15, 30 and 60mg/kg doses of cinnamic acid orally at alternate days for 15days. Cinnamic acid pre-treatment was found to reduce cyclophosphamide induced hypocellularity in the bone marrow and spleen. This recovery was also reflected in the peripheral blood count. Amelioration of hypocellularity could be correlated with the modulation of cell cycle phase distribution. Cinnamic acid pre-treatment reduced bone marrow and hepatic oxidative stress as evident by lipid peroxidation and activity assays of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione-S-transferase. The present study indicates that cinnamic acid pretreatment has protective influence on the myelosuppression and oxidative stress induced by cyclophosphamide. This investigation is an attempt and is the first of its kind to establish cinnamic acid as an agent whose consumption provides protection to normal cells from the toxic effects of a widely used anti-cancer drug.	cinnamomum cassia cinnamic acid
1	Jin Gui Shen Qi Wan, a traditional Chinese medicine, alleviated allergic airway hypersensitivity and inflammatory cell infiltration in a chronic asthma mouse model.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: In Asia, Jin Gui Shen Qi Wan (JGSQW) has been used for hundreds of years to treat asthma. AIM OF THE STUDY: The traditional Chinese medicine JGSQW is composed of Rehmannia glutinosa, Dioscorea opposita, Cornus officinalis, Poria cocos, Paeonia suffruticosa, Alisma orientalis, Aconitum carmichaelii and Cinnamomum cassia. However, the immunological mechanism underlying the effect of JGSQW treatment on asthma remains unclear. This study examined whether JGSQW has the potential to reduce asthma symptoms in mice with chronic asthma induced by recurrent Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Der p) stimulation, as well as its immunoregulatory mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The airways of BALB/c mice were stimulated with Der p (i.t.) once per week (50 muL, 1 mg/mL) for 6 consecutive weeks, and the mice were fed JGSQW (1 g/kg) 30 min prior to the Der p stimulation. Three days after the last stimulation, the mice were sacrificed to evaluate the airway remodelling, infiltration of inflammatory cells, lung histological features, and total IgE in the blood. Additionally, after A549 cells were treated with JGSQW, loganin, or paeoniflorin for 30 min, 10 ng/mL IL-1beta was added to stimulate the A549 cells to evaluate the effect of the medicine on the ICAM-1 gene expression after IL-1beta stimulation. RESULTS: JGSQW significantly reduced the Der p-induced infiltration of inflammatory cells into airways and decreased the total IgE and Der p-specific IgG1 in serum. Collagen assays and histopathological examinations showed that JGSQW reduced lung airway remodelling. Additionally, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay and immunohistochemical staining verified that JGSQW inhibited the NF-kB expression in airway epithelial cell nuclei. JGSQW, loganin, and paeoniflorin inhibited the ICAM-1 gene expression caused by the IL-1beta stimulation of A549 cells, and loganin and paeoniflorin had the maximum inhibitory effect when mixed according to the combination of doses in JGSQW. CONCLUSION: These results indicated that in the chronic asthma mouse model, JGSQW inhibits the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the airways and airway remodelling and exhibits specific immunoregulatory effects. JGSQW with certain doses of loganin and paeoniflorin inhibited ICAM-1 gene expression in epithelial cells.	paeonia suffruticosa paeoniflorin
2	Cinnamomum cassia Presl: A Review of Its Traditional Uses, Phytochemistry, Pharmacology and Toxicology.Cinnamomum cassia Presl is a tropical aromatic evergreen tree of the Lauraceae family, commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine. It is also a traditional spice, widely used around the world. This paper summarizes the achievements of modern research on C. cassia, including the traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacology and toxicology. In addition, this review also discusses some significant issues and the potential direction of future C. cassia research. More than 160 chemicals have been separated and identified from C. cassia. The main constituents of C. cassia are terpenoids, phenylpropanoids, glycosides, etc. Modern studies have confirmed that C. cassia has a wide range of pharmacological effects, including antitumour, anti-inflammatory and analgesic, anti-diabetic and anti-obesity, antibacterial and antiviral, cardiovascular protective, cytoprotective, neuroprotective, immunoregulatory effects, anti-tyrosinase activity and other effects. However, the modern studies of C. cassia are still not complete and more in-depth investigations need to be conducted in alimentotherapy, health product, toxicity and side effects, and more bioactive components and potential pharmacological effects need to be explored in the future.	c. cassia diabetic
2	An unusual manifestation of Abrus precatorius poisoning: a report of two cases.Abrus precatorius seeds are highly toxic and are often ingested as a means of suicide in India. Hemorrhagic gastroenteritis with erosions, hemolysis, acute renal damage, hepatotoxicity with elevated liver enzymes, and seizures are common manifestations of toxicity. We report two cases of Abrus precatorius poisoning with raised intracranial pressure (ICP) and papilledema that have not been described earlier in literature. One patient recovered completely with conservative management to lower raised ICP while the other patient expired before effective treatment could be institutedd. The cases are being reported to propose the need for routine fundus examination and brain imaging in severe abrus poisoning with CNS toxicity, as early institution of treatment for cerebral edema measures may be life saving.	abrus precatorius papilledema
1	Purification and characterization of flavonoids from the leaves of Zanthoxylum bungeanum and correlation between their structure and antioxidant activity.Nine flavonoids were isolated and characterized from the leaves of Zanthoxylum bungeanum. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic techniques as quercetin (1), afzelin (2), quercitrin (3), trifolin (4), quercetin-3-O-beta-D-glucoside (5), isorhamnetin 3-O-alpha-L-rhamnoside (6), hyperoside (7), vitexin (8) and rutin (9). All compounds were isolated from the leaves of Z. bungeanum for the first time. Five compounds (2, 4, 5, 6 and 8) were found for the first time in the genus Zanthoxylum. To learn the mechanisms underlying its health benefits, in vitro (DPPH, ABTS, FRAP and lipid peroxidation inhibition assays) and in vivo (protective effect on Escherichia coli under peroxide stress) antioxidant activities of the nine flavonoids were measured. Quercetin and quercetin glycosides (compounds 1, 3, 5, 7, 9) showed the highest antioxidant activity. Structure-activity relationships indicated that the -OH in 4' position on the B ring and the -OH in 7 position on the A ring possessed high antioxidant activity; B ring and/or A ring with adjacent -OH groups could greatly increase their antioxidant ability. Also, due to the different structures of various flavonoids, they will certainly exhibit different antioxidant capacity when the reactions occur in solution or in oil-in-water emulsion. These findings suggest that Z. bungeanum leaves may have health benefits when consumed. It could become a useful supplement for pharmaceutical products and functional food ingredients in both nutraceutical and food industries as a potential source of natural antioxidants. 	z. bungeanum vitexin
2	Inhibitory effect of 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde on nitric oxide production through inhibition of NF-kappa B activation in RAW 264.7 cells.Cinnamomum cassia has been widely used for treating dyspepsia, gastritis, and inflammatory disease. In the present study, several of cinnamaldehyde derivatives were synthesized from various cinnamic acid based on the 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde isolated from the bark C. cassia Blume was investigated to compare their NO production and NF-kappa B activity from Raw 264.7 cell since nitric oxide (NO) and NF-kappa B have been shown to be implicated factors in the inflammatory disease. The results show that HCA, among the derivatives, most significantly inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NO production and NF-kappa B transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner with an IC(50) value of 8 and 22 microM, respectively. We next investigated putative possible mechanisms of inhibitory effect of HCA on NO production. The inhibition of NO by HCA was consistent with the inhibitory effect on LPS-induced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression. Moreover, HCA inhibited LPS-induced p50 and p65 translocation resulting in the inhibition of the DNA binding activity of the NF-kappa B, a central regulator of iNOS. The present results provided evidence that HCA, among cinnamaledhyde derivatives, has the most inhibitory effect on NO production through inhibition of NF-kappa B activation, and thus can be used as an anti-inflammatory agent.	c. cassia dyspepsia
2	Histochemical localization of glycoconjugates on microglial cells in Alzheimer's disease brain samples by using Abrus precatorius, Maackia amurensis, Momordica charantia, and Sambucus nigra lectins.Four lectins (Abrus precatorius (APA), Maackia amurensis (MAA), Momordica charantia (MCA) and Sambucus nigra (SNA)) have been used to identify glycohistochemically the microglial cells (MGC) activation in autoptic brain samples from Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects. Three of these lectins (APA, MAA and MCA) have utilized as microglial cell markers for the first time. The identification of new markers for the study of MGC is very important to better understand the role of these type of cells in the metabolic/dismetabolic control of betaA4 in AD which still represents a vexata questio.

1	Apoptosis inducing activity of benzophenanthridine-type alkaloids and 2-arylbenzofuran neolignans in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells.Thirteen compounds belonging to different classes of alkaloids (1-9) and lignans (10-13), isolated from the methanol extract of roots of the African medicinal plant Zanthoxylum capense, were assayed for their ability as apoptosis inducers in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells. The cytotoxicity of these compounds was evaluated in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells by the MTS assay. Out of the tested compounds, three benzophenanthridine alkaloids (1, 4, and 7), a dibenzyl butyrolactone lignan (10), and two 2-arylbenzofuran neolignans (12 and 13) displayed significant cytotoxicity to HCT116 cells, confirmed by the Guava ViaCount viability assay. The selected compounds (1, 4, 7, 10, 12, and 13) were further tested for apoptosis induction activity in HCT116 cells, by evaluation of nuclear morphology following Hoechst staining, and by caspase-3 like activity assays. Morphologic evaluation of HCT116 nuclei following Hoechst staining and fluorescence microscopy revealed that compounds 1, 4, 7, 10, 12, and 13 induced apoptosis in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells, producing similar, or higher, apoptosis levels when compared with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), the cornerstone cytotoxic used in colon cancer treatment for several decades. In fact, HCT116 cells developed morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis, including chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation and formation of apoptotic bodies. Importantly, compounds 4 and 13 at 20 muM were the most promising in this study, inducing respectively ~11- and 7-fold increases in apoptotic cells as compared to vehicle control, whereas 5-FU increased apoptosis by ~2-fold. Apoptosis induction for compounds 4 and 13 was further confirmed by caspase-3-like activity assays, which showed respectively ~2- and 1.5-fold increases in caspase-3-like activity compared to vehicle control. These results suggested that specific benzophenanthridine alkaloids and 2-arylbenzofuran neolignans isolated from Zanthoxylum capense show strong anticancer activity in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells.	zanthoxylum capense alkaloids
1	Zanthoxylum ailanthoides Sieb and Zucc. extract inhibits growth and induces cell death through G2/M-phase arrest and activation of apoptotic signals in colo 205 human colon adenocarcinoma cells.The effects of 50% ethanolic stem extracts of Zanthoxylum ailanthoides Sieb and Zucc. (ZASZ) on the cell viability, cell cycle and apoptosis were investigated in a human colon adenocarcinoma cell line (colo 205). The results demonstrated that ZASZ induced morphological changes and decreased the cell viability. ZASZ promoted Wee1, checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2), p21 and p53 levels, decreased cyclin B and cdc25c associated with that led to G(2)/M phase arrest. ZASZ-triggered apoptosis was confirmed by 4' -6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining and DNA gel electrophoresis. ZASZ increased the levels of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and growth arrest and DNA damage inducible gene 153 (GADD153), and promoted an increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca(2+) release, and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) accompanied by cytochrome c release that was due to the decrease of Bcl-2 and increase of Bax levels in the colo 205 cells. ZASZ also induced the protein levels of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and endonuclease G (Endo G), increased the levels of caspase-3, -7 and -9, and stimulated the levels of fatty acid synthase (Fas) and Fas ligand in the colo 205 cells. ZASZ contains phenolic compounds, including flavone, chlorogenic acid and isofraxidin, among which, flavone was found to be the most effective in reducing cell viability and proliferative responses in the colo 205 cells. ZASZ induces cytotoxicity and apoptosis in colo 205 cells which provides the rationale for studies in animal models on the utilization of ZASZ as a potential cancer therapeutic compound.	zanthoxylum ailanthoides chlorogenic acid
3	trans-Cinnamaldehyde Inhibits Microglial Activation and Improves Neuronal Survival against Neuroinflammation in BV2 Microglial Cells with Lipopolysaccharide Stimulation.Background: Microglial activation contributes to neuroinflammation and neuronal damage in neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. It has been suggested that neurodegenerative disorders may be improved if neuroinflammation can be controlled. trans-cinnamaldehyde (TCA) isolated from the stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia possesses potent anti-inflammatory capability; we thus tested whether TCA presents neuroprotective effects on improving neuronal survival by inhibiting neuroinflammatory responses in BV2 microglial cells. Results: To determine the molecular mechanism behind TCA-mediated neuroprotective effects, we assessed the effects of TCA on lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced proinflammatory responses in BV2 microglial cells. While LPS potently induced the production and expression upregulation of proinflammatory mediators, including NO, iNOS, COX-2, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha, TCA pretreatment significantly inhibited LPS-induced production of NO and expression of iNOS, COX-2, and IL-1beta and recovered the morphological changes in BV2 cells. TCA markedly attenuated microglial activation and neuroinflammation by blocking nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway. With the aid of microglia and neuron coculture system, we showed that TCA greatly reduced LPS-elicited neuronal death and exerted neuroprotective effects. Conclusions: Our results suggest that TCA, a natural product, has the potential of being used as a therapeutic agent against neuroinflammation for ameliorating neurodegenerative disorders.

1	Purification, structural characterization, and hypolipidemic effects of a neutral polysaccharide from Ziziphus Jujuba cv. Muzao.A neutral polysaccharide (PZMP1) with a molecular weight of 16.97 kDa was isolated from Ziziphus Jujuba cv. Muzao with water extraction, ethanol precipitation, and purification with DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow and Sephacryl S-300 column chromatography. PZMP1 was structurally characterized with high-performance gel-permeation chromatography, gas chromatography, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, methylation analysis, NMR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. The results show that PZMP1 is a homogeneous heteropolysaccharide composed of arabinose, galactose, glucose, mannose, and xylose in a molar percentage of 17.36: 3.29:2.68:1.05:1.00. The majorly backbone of PZMP1 is composed of 1,3,5-linked Araf, 1,3-linked Araf, 1,5-linked Araf, 1,4-linked Glcp, and 1-linked Araf, 1-linked Glcp. According to an NMR analysis, the repeating unit of PZMP1 is a linear backbone with branches at positions O-3, and O-5. PZMP1 also displays effective dose-dependent hypolipidemic activity, suggesting that it is a natural hypolipidemic agent, which could contribute to the functional food qualities of jujube fruit.	jujube xylose

2	Inhibition of xanthine oxidase by some Chinese medicinal plants used to treat gout.The enzyme xanthine oxidase catalyses the oxidation of hypoxanthine to xanthine and then to uric acid, which plays a crucial role in gout. A total of 122 traditional Chinese medicinal plants, selected according to the clinical efficacy and prescription frequency for the treatment of gout and other hyperuricemia-related disorders, have been evaluated for the enzyme inhibitory activity. Among the 122 methanol extracts derived from these species, 69 were shown to be inhibitory at 100 microg/ml, with 29 having greater than 50% inhibition. As to the equal amount of water extracts, 40 were disclosed to be active at 100 microg/ml, with 13 possessing more than 50% inhibition. At 50 microg/ml, 58 methanol and 24 water extracts exhibited inhibitory activity, with 15 of the former and two of the latter showing greater than 50% inhibition. The most active was the methanol extract of the twig of Cinnamomum cassia (Lauraceae) (IC(50), 18 microg/ml), which was followed immediately by those of the flower of Chrysanthemum indicum (Asteraceae) (IC(50), 22 microg/ml) and the leaves of Lycopus europaeus (Lamiatae) (IC(50), 26 microg/ml). Among the water extracts, the strongest inhibition of the enzyme was observed with that of the rhizome of Polygonum cuspidatum (Polygonaceae) (IC(50), 38 microg/ml). The IC(50) value of allopurinol used as a positive control was 1.06 microg/ml. The study demonstrated that the effects for these medicinal plants used for the gout treatment were based, at least in part, on the xanthine oxidase inhibitory action.	polygonum cuspidatum gout
2	Antibacterial activities of extracts from Ugandan medicinal plants used for oral care.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Medicinal plants are widely used for treatment of oral/dental diseases in Uganda. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate antibacterial activities of 16 commonly used medicinal plants on microorganisms associated with periodontal diseases (PD) and dental caries (DC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pulp juice and solvent extracts (hexane, methanol and water) from the plants were tested against Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia associated with PD and Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus acidophilus associated with DC. Tests were done using agar well-diffusion (pulp juice) and agar-dilution (Solvent extracts) assays. RESULTS: Pulp juice from Zanthoxylum chalybeum and Euclea latidens showed activity against all the bacteria, Zanthoxylum chalybeum being most active. Hexane extract from aerial part of Helichrysum odoratissimum was most active (MIC: 0.125-0.5 mg/ml). Methanol extract from leaves of Lantana trifolia showed activity against all bacteria (MIC: 0.25-1 mg/ml). CONCLUSION: Several of the tested plants showed antibacterial activities against bacteria associated with PD and DC, meriting further investigations.	zanthoxylum chalybeum periodontal diseases
1	In vitro efficacy of 75 essential oils against Aspergillus niger.Aspergillus niger is an opportunistic human pathogen and a strong air pollutant. A study was conducted with 75 different essential oils for the inhibition of hyphal growth and spore formation in Aspergillus niger. Cinnamomum zeylanicum (bark), Cinnamomum zeylanicum (leaf), Cinnamomum cassia, Syzygium aromaticum and Cymbopogon citratus were the top five essential oils which demonstrated marked inhibitory effect against hyphal growth and spore formation of A. niger. The chemical composition of these five most active essential oils was investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectra (GC-MS). Most of the other essential oils were found challenging to combat A. niger, suggesting their use as strong aroma therapeutic agents.	syzygium aromaticum essential oils
0	2-Methoxycinnamaldehyde inhibits the TNF-alpha-induced proliferation and migration of human aortic smooth muscle cells.The abnormal proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is a crucial event in the development of atherosclerosis, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is actively involved in this process by enhancing the proliferation and migration of VSMCs. 2-Methoxycinnamaldehyde (MCA) is a natural compound of Cinnamomum cassia. Although 2-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (HCA), another compound from Cinnamomum cassia, has been widely studied with regard to its antitumor activity, MCA has not attracted researchers' interest due to its mild toxic effects on cancer cells and its mechanisms of action remain unknown. In this study, we examined the effects of MCA on the TNF-alpha-induced proliferation and migration of human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). As shown by our results, MCA inhibited TNF-alpha-induced cell proliferation by reducing the levels of cyclin D1, cyclin D3, CDK4 and CDK6, and increasing the levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p21 and p27, without resulting in cellular cytotoxicity. Furthermore, MCA decreased the level of secreted matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 by inhibiting MMP-9 transcription. Unexpectedly, MCA did not affect the TNF-alpha-induced levels of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). However, by showing that MCA potently inhibited the degradation of IkappaBalpha and the subsequent nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), we demonstrated that MCA exerts its effects through the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. MCA also effectively inhibited platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced HASMC migration. Taken together, these observations suggest that MCA has the potential for use as an anti-atherosclerotic agent.	MCA NF-kappaB
1	Optimization of the extraction conditions and quantification by RP-LC analysis of three alkaloids in Zanthoxylum nitidum roots.CONTEXT: A classic traditional Chinese medicine, Zanthoxylum nitidum (Roxb.) DC. widely used in China, exhibits anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antianalgesic activities. Alkaloids are one of the main bioactive components. It is urgent to develop a simple and reliable method to determine the main alkaloids in Z. nitidum roots. OBJECTIVE: To determine the three alkaloids in Z. nitidum roots, a reversed-phase liquid chromatographic (RP-LC) method combined with an optimum extraction condition was established. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A method involving four-factor-three-level orthogonal array design including the extracting solvent and the RP-LC condition was assayed. Twenty batches were collected from different areas of the Guangxi Province at different harvesting times. The determined alkaloids were nitidine chloride (NC, 1), ethoxychelerythrine (2) and liriodenine (3). The stable mobile phase was a C18 packing, and the mobile phase was acetonitril-aqueous phosphoric acid-triethylamine-buffer solution. RESULTS: The optimum extraction and detection conditions have been determined in the process of quantification of Z. nitidum root alkaloids. The three alkaloids were detected simultaneously in the 20 batches of samples. The results clearly showed that alkaloid concentrations differed significantly among Z. nitidum collected from various collection areas. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: We have established an optimum extraction and detection conditions in the process of quantification the three alkaloids in Z. nitidum roots. From this research, the most influenced factor on Z. nitidum roots was the collecting location, and the next factor was the harvesting time. The collecting location and the harvesting time should be considered as the high-quality medicinal herbs factors.	z. nitidum ethoxychelerythrine
1	[Analysis and utilization value discussion of multiple chemical composition in different tissues of Abelmoschus manihot].This research is to analyze the resourceful chemical composition in different tissues (root, stem, leaf and flower) of Abelmoschus manihot and evaluate their utilizing value. The flavonoids, soluble polysaccharides, cellulose, nucleosides and amino acids in the different tissues of A. manihot were determined by HPLC coupled with UV-Vis spectrophotpmetry, and UPLC-TQ/MS. The flowers are rich in the resourceful chemical compositions of flavonoids which mainly consist of hyperoside, isoquercitrin, cotton-8-O-glucuronide, myricetin, quercetin-3'-O-glucoside, rutin and quercetin. The total content of these flavonoids is 25.450 mg g-1 in the flowers, while they are trace in the other tissues.Different tissues of A. manihot are rich in soluble polysaccharides and celluloses and the stems have the highest content(19.76%) of soluble polysaccharides, while the roots have the highest content (29.88%) of cellulose. Total of 21 amino acids and 9 nucleosides were detected in this plant, and the flowers have the highest content of amino acids(4.737 mg g-1), while the leaves have the highest content of nucleosides (1.474 mg g-1). A. manihot is rich in the resourceful chemical compositions, and its constituents and contents are various in different tissues of this plant.The results provided a scientific basis for the utilization and industrial development of A. manihot plants.	a. manihot flavonoids
2	Traditional Japanese medicines inhibit compound action potentials in the frog sciatic nerve.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Traditional Japanese (Kampo) medicines have a variety of clinical effects including pain alleviation, but evidence for a mechanism for their pain relief has not yet been elucidated fully. Considering that Kampo medicine contains many plant-derived chemicals having an ability to inhibit nerve action potential conduction, it is possible that this medicine inhibits nerve conduction. The purpose of the present study was to know how various Kampo medicines affect nerve conduction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined the effects of Kampo and crude medicines on compound action potentials (CAPs) recorded from the frog sciatic nerve by using the air-gap method. RESULTS: Daikenchuto, rikkosan, kikyoto, rikkunshito, shakuyakukanzoto and kakkonto concentration-dependently reduced the peak amplitude of the CAP. Among the Kampo medicines, daikenchuto was the most effective in inhibiting CAPs. Daikenchuto is composed of three kinds of crude medicine, Japanese pepper, processed ginger and ginseng radix. When the crude medicines were tested, Japanese pepper and processed ginger reduced CAP peak amplitudes, while ginseng radix hardly affected CAPs. Moreover, there was an interaction between the Japanese pepper and processed ginger activities in such that one medicine at low but not high concentrations increased the extent of the inhibition by the other one that was co-applied. CONCLUSIONS: Kampo medicines have an ability to inhibit nerve conduction. This action of daikenchuto is due to Japanese pepper and processed ginger but not ginseng radix, probably through an interaction between Japanese pepper and processed ginger in a manner dependent on their concentrations. Nerve conduction inhibition could contribute to at least a part of Kampo medicine's clinical effects such as pain alleviation.	ginseng pain
2	Antioxidant and antiproliferative activities of Abrus precatorius leaf extracts--an in vitro study.BACKGROUND: The use of traditional medicine at the primary health care level is widespread and plant-based treatments are being recommended for curing various diseases by traditional medical practitioners all over the world. The phytochemicals present in the fruits, vegetables and medicinal plants are getting attention day-by-day for their active role in the prevention of several human diseases. Abrus precatorius is a widely distributed tropical medicinal plant with several therapeutic properties. Therefore in the present study, A. precatorius leaf extracts were examined for their antioxidant and cytotoxic properties in vitro in order to discover resources for new lead structures or to improve the traditional medicine. METHODS: In this study, antioxidant and antiproliferative properties of the different leaf extracts (hexane, ethyl acetate, ethanol and water) from A. precatorius were investigated along with the quantification of the polyphenol and flavonoid contents. The ability of deactivating free radicals was extensively investigated with in vitro biochemical methods like DPPH( ), ( )OH, NO, SO(2-) scavenging assays and inhibition capability of Fe(II)-induced lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, antiproliferative activities using different human cancer cell lines and primary cell line was carried out by MTT method. RESULTS: Total phenolic content and total flavonoid content of the extracts were found in the range of 1.65 +- 0.22 to 25.48 +- 0.62 GAE mg/g dw and 6.20 +- 0.41 to 17.16 +- 1.04 QE mg/g dw respectively. The experimental results further revealed that A. precatorius extracts showed strong antiradical properties, capable to chelate Fe(2+) and possess good inhibition ability of lipid peroxidation. In addition, as a first step towards the identification of phytoconstituents endowed with potent chemopreventive activities, we evaluated the inhibitory effects of A. precatorius extracts on the proliferation of four different human tumour cell lines such as human colon adenocarcinoma cells (Colo-205), human retinoblastoma cancer cells (Y79), human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2) and Leukemia cells (SupT1). Ethanol extract (APA) and ethyl acetate extract (APE) of A. precatorius had apparent capabilities of inhibiting the survival of tested human cancer cell lines. Moreover, it was observed that the A. precatorius extracts did not inhibit the growth of mice peritoneal macrophages, thus confirming that plants extracts are selective against the cancer cell lines. CONCLUSION: This work provides a scientific support for the high antioxidant and antiproliferative activity of this plant and thus it may find potential applications in the treatment of the diseases caused by ROS. Further studies are needed to confirm in vivo anti-tumorgenicity and subsequent chemical characterization of the active molecule(s).	a. precatorius hepatocellular carcinoma
1	Topical antiinflammatory activity of the major lipophilic constituents of the rhizome of Zingiber cassumunar. Part I: The essential oil.The essential oil of the rhizome of Zingiber cassumunar was found to exhibit a topical antiinflammatory effect, when tested using the model of carrageenan-induced hind paw edema in rats (ID(50) = 22 mg oil/paw). Individual assessment of topical antiinflammatory activity of the five major components of the oil demonstrated that (E)-1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)butadiene (DMPBD), terpinen-4-ol and alpha-terpinene significantly inhibited edema formation, whereas sabinene and gamma-terpinene were inactive up to 6 mg/paw. The most active compound, DMPBD, was found to be an antiinflammatory agent twice as potent as the reference drug diclofenac (ID(50) = 3 vs 6 mg/paw, respectively).	zingiber cassumunar terpinen-4-ol
1	Authentication and quantitative analysis on the chemical profile of cassia bark (cortex cinnamomi) by high-pressure liquid chromatography.Cassia bark or cortex cinnamomi, the dried stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia Presl. (Lauraceae), is a popular natural spice and a commonly used herb in traditional Chinese medicine. However, adulterants are frequently found in the market. In this study, 44 samples of Cassia bark including bark from seven related Cinnamomum species were collected from fields and market. Four characteristic components, cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, and coumarin were determined by RP-HPLC, and a fingerprint comprised of five markers was established. These results showed that cassia barks contained high contents of cinnamaldehyde (13.01-56.93 mg/g). The highest content of cinnamaldehyde (up to 93.83 mg/g) was found in debarked cortex, which is traditionally regarded as having the best quality in local herb shops. In contrast, the adulterants from the other Cinnamomum species, C. wilsonii Camble, C. japonicum Sieb., C. mairei Levl. and C. burmanii (Nees) Blume, contained low contents of cinnamaldehyde (&lt;2.00 mg/g). The content of cinnamaldehyde in C. loureirii Nees was comparable to that in C. cassia. It is suggested that five characteristic peaks by HPLC are suitable for distinguishing genuine cassia bark from the adulterants and could be applied in the quality control of this commodity.	cassia bark coumarin
4	Apoptosis induction of 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde as a proteasome inhibitor is associated with ER stress and mitochondrial perturbation in cancer cells.2'-Hydroxycinnamaldehyde (HCA), isolated from the stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia, and 2'-benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde (BCA), one of HCA derivatives, have antiproliferative activities on several human cancer cell lines. Our previous study suggested that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and caspase-3 are the major regulators of HCA-induced apoptosis. In the present study, we demonstrated a novel molecular target using in vitro pull-down assay by biotin-labeled HCA (biotin-HCA) in SW620 cells. We analyzed 11 differential spots of 2-dimensional gel prepared with pull-downed proteins by biotin-HCA. Among them, five spots were identified as proteasome subunits. An in vitro 26S proteasome function assay using specific fluorogenic substrates showed that HCA potently inhibits L3-like activity of the proteasome. In addition, HCA showed inhibitory action against chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and PGPH-like activities. DNA microarray showed that HCA induced heat shock family and ER stress-responsive genes, which reflects the accumulation of misfolded proteins by proteasome inhibition. On western blot analysis, it was confirmed that HCA induces glucose-regulated protein, 78 kDa (GRP78) and some representative endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-responsive proteins. Furthermore, HCA treatment decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. The effect of HCA on cytochrome c and Bax translocation between cytosol and mitochondrial membrane was clarified using western blot analysis. These results suggest that HCA-induced apoptosis is associated with the inhibition of the proteasome activity that leads in turn to the increase of ER stress and mitochondrial perturbation.	cytochrome c cancer
1	Zizimauritic acids A-C, three novel nortriterpenes from Ziziphus mauritiana.Zizimauritic acids A-C (1-3), three novel nortriterpenes with a unique A-nor-E-seco spiro-lactone ceanothane-type triterpene skeleton, together with 3 known triterpenes ceanothenic acid (4), betulinic acid (5), and ceanothic acid (6), were isolated from the roots of Ziziphus mauritiana. Compounds 1-4 showed cytotoxicities with the IC(50) values ranging from 5.05 to 11.94 mug/ml, and compounds 1 and 3 showed an inhibitory effect on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus with the IC(50) values 2.17 and 12.79 mug/ml. A plausible biosynthetic pathway of compounds 1-3 was proposed.	ziziphus mauritiana ceanothenic acid
1	Antioxidative Activity of Flavonoids from Abrus cantoniensis against Ethanol-Induced Gastric Ulcer in Mice.The present study investigated the flavonoids from Abrus cantoniensis against ethanol-induced gastric ulcers in mice. The flavonoids from A. cantoniensis were extracted with ethanol and purified by macroporous resin and polyamide. The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl assay was used to measure the antioxidative activities in vitro. The ethanol-induced ulcer mouse model was used to evaluate the gastroprotective activities of the flavonoids from A. cantoniensis. In addition, a method was established to ensure accuracy for animal ulcer evaluation. The flavonoids from A. cantoniensis showed a strong free radical scavenging capacity with an IC50 of 43.83 microg/mL in the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl assay. At doses between 28.16-112.67 mg/kg, the flavonoids conspicuously reduced the ulcer index in ethanol-induced mice (p&lt;0.001). Significant differences were found in the levels of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione, and myeloperoxidase in the stomach tissues between the flavonoids from the A. cantoniensis groups and the ethanol control group. The gastroprotective effect of the flavonoids from A. cantoniensis could be due to its antioxidative activity of the defensive mechanism. The data revealed that the flavonoids from A. cantoniensis could be a potential therapeutic agent for gastric ulcer prevention and treatment.	a. cantoniensis flavonoids
4	Nitidine chloride prevents OVX-induced bone loss via suppressing NFATc1-mediated osteoclast differentiation.Nitidine chloride (NC), a bioactive alkaloid isolated from Zanthoxylum nitidum, has been used as a herbal ingredient in toothpaste that prevents cavities for decades. It also displays potential antitumor and anti-inflammation properties. However, its anticatabolic effect on bone is not known. We investigated the effect of NC on osteoclastogenesis, bone resorption and RANKL-induced NF-kappaB and NFATc1 signalling. In mouse-derived bone marrow monocytes (BMMs), NC suppressed RANKL-induced multinucleated tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive osteoclast formation and bone resorption in a dose dependent manner. NC attenuated the expression of osteoclast marker genes including cathepsin K, D2, calcitonin receptor, NFATc1, and TRAP. Further, NC inhibited RANKL-activated NF-kappaB and NFATc1 signalling pathways. In vivo study revealed that NC abrogated oestrogen deficiency-induced bone loss in ovariectomized mice. Histological analysis showed that the number of osteoclasts was significantly lower in NC-treated groups. Collectively, our data demonstrate that NC suppressed osteoclastogenesis and prevented OVX-induced bone loss by inhibiting RANKL-induced NF-kappaB and NFATc1 signalling pathways. NC may be a natural and novel treatment for osteoclast-related bone lytic diseases.	NFATc1 bone loss

3	Cardioprotective effects of silver fir (Abies alba) extract in ischemic-reperfused isolated rat hearts.BACKGROUND: Silver fir trunk extract (SFTE) is a complex mixture of antioxidative polyphenols (lignans and phenolic acids) from the trunks of silver fir trees (Abies alba, lignum). In our previous study, we have shown that SFTE exerts strong antioxidative and protective effects against atherogenic, diet-induced arterial wall damage. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to test the potential protective effects of SFTE and its compounds, two phenolic acids (p-coumaric and protocatechuic acids) in ischemia-reperfusion injury of isolated rat hearts. DESIGN: Isolated hearts of Wistar rats aged 4-8 weeks were exposed to perfusion, ischemia, and reperfusion periods. The experiments were performed using the following five groups: control, SFTE (10 microg/L), SFTE (100 microg/L), protocatechuic acid, and p-coumaric. Aortas were isolated to measure vascular responses in the presence of Nomega-Nitro-L-arginine. RESULTS: SFTE dose-dependently reduced ischemic-reperfusion heart damage, which was indicated as the decrease in the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release rate and arrhythmias duration by 80% and an increase in coronary flow rate during the reperfusion period. Two tested compounds (p-coumaric and protocatechuic acids) acted less cardioprotective, since they decreased the duration of arrhythmias only by 40 and 45%, respectively, and did not decrease LDH release rates during the reperfusion period. Only p-coumaric acid increased coronary flow rates, whereas protocatechuic acid did not. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the SFTE exerted the strongest cardioprotective effect, whereas its constituents (the p-coumaric and protocatechuic acids) were less effective in inducing cardioprotection.	protocatechuic acids arrhythmias
4	Inhibitory effect of Abrus abrin-derived peptide fraction against Dalton's lymphoma ascites model.Peptides derived from larger molecules that are important modulators in cancer regression are becoming leads for development of therapeutic drugs. It has been reported that Abrus abrin, isolated from the seeds of Abrus precatorius, showed in vitro and in vivo antitumor properties by the induction of apoptosis. The present study was designed to evaluate the in vivo therapeutic effectiveness of abrin-derived peptide (ABP) fraction in Dalton's lymphoma (DL) mice model. The lethal dose (LD(50)) of ABP was found to be 2.25 mg/kg body weight and further the acute toxicity was determined with sublethal doses in normal mice. The acute toxicity like body weight, peripheral blood cell count, lympho-hematological and biochemical parameters remained unaffected till 200 microg/kg body weight of ABP. The sublethal doses of ABP showed very significant growth inhibitory properties in vivo DL mice model. There were 24%, 70.8% and 89.7% reductions in DL cell survival in 25, 50 and 100 microg/kg body weight of ABP, respectively. Analysis of the growth inhibitory mechanism in DL cells revealed nuclear fragmentation, and condensation with the appearance of the sub-G(0)/G(1) peak is indicative of apoptosis. Further, the Western blotting showed that apoptosis was mediated by the reduction in the ratio of Bcl-2 and Bax protein expression, and activation of caspase-3 through the release of cytochrome c in DL cells. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed an effective antitumor response (104.6 increase in life span (ILS) %) with a dose of 100 microg/kg body weight.	caspase-3 cancer
3	trans-Cinnamaldehyde Reverses Depressive-Like Behaviors in Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress Rats by Inhibiting NF-kappaB/NLRP3 Inflammasome Pathway.trans-Cinnamaldehyde (TCA) is the main active component extracted from Cinnamomum cassia (C. cassia), which has many pharmacological effects, such as anti-inflammation, lowering blood glucose, and improving nerve function. However, there is no report of TCA in the treatment of depression. The purpose of this study was to investigate the antidepressant-like effect of TCA and the mechanism of NF kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition by TCA. We divided 40 rats into the control group, CUMS group, FLU group, and the TCA group. The activation of the NF-kappaB pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of rats in each group was observed. After the treatments with FLU and TCA, the sucrose consumptions in rats increased significantly and the immobility time in forced swimming was decreased significantly compared to the CUMS group. The expression of TLR4, NF-kappaB-1, p-p65, TNF-alpha, NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, IL-1beta, and IL-18 proteins in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus was decreased, and the expression of IL-1beta, IL-18, and TNF-alpha in serum was downregulated compared to the CUMS group. Similar to FLU, TCA reverses the depression-like behaviors in rats, which indicates that TCA has a significant antidepressant-like effect. The mechanism of the antidepressant property of TCA might be that it inhibits the activation of the NF-kappaB pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of CUMS rats.

2	Identification of three competitive inhibitors for membrane-associated, Mg2+-dependent and neutral 60 kDa sphingomyelinase activity.Methanol extracts of domestic plants of Korea were evaluated as a potential inhibitor of neutral pH optimum and membrane-associated 60 kDa sphingomyelinase (N-SMase) activity. In this study, we partially purified N-SMase from bovine brain membranes using ammonium sulfate. It was purified approximately 163-fold by the sequential use of DE52, Butyl-Toyopearl, DEAE-Cellulose, and Phenyl-5PW column chromatographies. The purified N-SMase activity was assayed in the presence of the plant extracts of three hundreds species. Based on the in vitro assay, three plant extracts significantly inhibited the N-SMase activity in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. To further examine the inhibitory pattern, a Dixon plot was constructed for each of the plant extracts. The extracts of Abies nephrolepis, Acer tegmentosum, and Ginkgo biloba revealed a competitive inhibition with the inhibition constant (Ki) of 11.9 microg/ mL, 9.4 microg/mL, and 12.9 microg/mL, respectively. These extracts also inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the production of ceramide induced by serum deprivation in human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y.	ginkgo biloba neuroblastoma
1	Phytochemical and biological activities of four wild medicinal plants.The fruits of four wild plants, namely, Capparis decidua, Ficus carica, Syzygium cumini, and Ziziphus jujuba, are separately used as traditional dietary and remedial agents in remote areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. The results of our study on these four plants revealed that the examined fruits were a valuable source of nutraceuticals and exhibited good level of antimicrobial activity. The fruits of these four investigated plants are promising source of polyphenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, and saponins. These four plants' fruits are good sources of iron, zinc, copper, manganese, selenium, and chromium. It was also observed that these fruits are potential source of antioxidant agent and the possible reason could be that these samples had good amount of phytochemicals. Hence, the proper propagation, conservation, and chemical investigation are recommended so that these fruits should be incorporated for the eradication of food and health related problems. 	syzygium cumini terpenoids
4	2'-Hydroxycinnamaldehyde inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis via signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 inactivation and reactive oxygen species generation.Inhibition of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway is a novel therapeutic strategy to treat human cancers with constitutively active STAT3. During the screening of natural products to find STAT3 inhibitors, we identified 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (HCA) as a STAT3 inhibitor, which was isolated from the stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia. In this study, we found that HCA inhibited constitutive and inducible STAT3 activation in STAT3-activated DU145 prostate cancer cells. HCA selectively inhibited the STAT3 activity by direct binding to STAT3, which was confirmed by biochemical methods, including a pull-down assay with biotin-conjugated HCA, a drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) experiment and a cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA). HCA inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation at the tyrosine 705 residue, dimer formation, and nuclear translocation in DU145 cells, which led to a downregulation of STAT3 target genes. The downregulation of cell cycle progression and antiapoptosis-related gene expression by HCA induced the accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle and then induced apoptosis. We also found that reactive oxygen species (ROS) were involved in the HCA-induced inhibition of STAT3 activation and cell proliferation because the suppressed p-STAT3 level was rescued by glutathione or N-acetyl-L-cysteine treatment, which are general ROS inhibitors. These results suggest that HCA could be a potent anticancer agent targeting STAT3-activated tumor cells.	STAT3 tumor
1	[Bioactivity and chemical composition of essential oil from Zanthoxylum beecheyanum var. alatum leaves against Culex pipens quinquefasciatus (Diptera: Culicidae)].The repellent activity of steam-distilled essential oil from Zanthoxlum beecheyamum var. alatum fresh leaves against Culex pipens quinquefasciatus was evaluated according to the "Laboratory Efficacy Criterions of Public Health Insecticides for Pesticide Registration-Repellent (GB/T 17322. 10-1998)" with some modifications in test procedure, the fumigating insecticidal activity of the essential oil to Cx. pipens quinquefasciatus adults was assessed by the "Efficacy Test Methods of Public Health Insecticides for Pesticide Registration-Method of Laboratory Efficacy Test for Electric Mat (GB 13917.5-1992)", and the larvicidal and pupicidal activities of the essential oil against Cx. pipens quinquefasciatus were investigated by immersion method in laboratory. Besides, the chemical components of the essential oil were analyzed and determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. At the dosage of 1.5 mg x cm(-2), the essential oil provided 100% protection against laboratory-reared female blood-starved individuals of Cx. pipens quinquefasciatus for (6.54 +/- 0.17) h. The 24 h LC50 value of the essential oil for Cx. pipens quinquefasciatus adults was 6.895 microg x cm(-3) when the fumigating dosage was 11.850 microg x cm(-3), and the KT50 value of the essential oil for the adults was 6.46 min. The 24 h LC50 value of the essential oil for IV instar larvae was 119.020 microg x ml(-1). Seventeen compounds in the essential oil were identified, accounting for 97.4% of the total. This essential oil exhibited high repellent activity and remarkable toxicity against Cx. pipens quinquefasciatus.	zanthoxylum beecheyanum var essential oil
1	Antioxidant and Free Radical Scavenging Capacity of Seed and Shell Essential Oils Extracted from Abrus precatorius (L).Essential oils from plants have been proven safe as natural antioxidants, and few are already marketed as digestive enhancers as well as in prevention of several degenerative diseases. This study evaluated the antioxidant capacity of seed and shell essential oils of Abrus precatorius (L), a herb used for ethno-medicinal practices in Nigeria. The essential oils were obtained by hydro-distillation. The ability of the oils to act as hydrogen/electrons donor or scavenger of radicals were determined by in-vitro antioxidant assays using 2,2-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl free radical (DPPH(.)) scavenging; 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical scavenging; lipid peroxide and nitric oxide radicals scavenging assays. The IC50 of the seed and shell oils (2.10 mg/mL and 1.20 mg/mL respectively) showed that antioxidant activity is higher than that for the standard drugs (3.20 mg/mL and 3.40 mg/mL) for the nitric oxide scavenging assay. The lipid peroxidation radical activity of the oils were similar to vitamin C, weak DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activities were discovered in comparison to vitamin C and rutin. Generally, in the four antioxidant assays, a significant correlation existed between concentrations of the oils and percentage inhibition of free radicals and lipid peroxidation. The composition of A. precatorius essential oils reported earlier may account for their antioxidant capacity. 	a. precatorius essential oils
4	Abrus Agglutinin, a type II ribosome inactivating protein inhibits Akt/PH domain to induce endoplasmic reticulum stress mediated autophagy-dependent cell death.Abrus agglutinin (AGG), a type II ribosome-inactivating protein has been found to induce mitochondrial apoptosis. In the present study, we documented that AGG-mediated Akt dephosphorylation led to ER stress resulting the induction of autophagy-dependent cell death through the canonical pathway in cervical cancer cells. Inhibition of autophagic death with 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and siRNA of Beclin-1 and ATG5 increased AGG-induced apoptosis. Further, inhibiting apoptosis by Z-DEVD-FMK and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) increased autophagic cell death after AGG treatment, suggesting that AGG simultaneously induced autophagic and apoptotic death in HeLa cells. Additionally, it observed that AGG-induced autophagic cell death in Bax knock down (Bax-KD) and 5-FU resistant HeLa cells, confirming as an alternate cell killing pathway to apoptosis. At the molecular level, AGG-induced ER stress in PERK dependent pathway and inhibition of ER stress by salubrinal, eIF2alpha phosphatase inhibitor as well as siPERK reduced autophagic death in the presence of AGG. Further, our in silico and colocalization study showed that AGG interacted with pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Akt to suppress its phosphorylation and consequent downstream mTOR dephosphorylation in HeLa cells. We showed that Akt overexpression could not augment GRP78 expression and reduced autophagic cell death by AGG as compared to pcDNA control, indicating Akt modulation was the upstream signal during AGG's ER stress mediated autophagic cell death. In conclusion, we established that AGG stimulated cell death by autophagy might be used as an alternative tumor suppressor mechanism in human cervical cancer.   2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

1	Pressurized liquid extraction and GC-MS analysis for simultaneous determination of seven components in Cinnamomum cassia and the effect of sample preparation.A pressurized liquid extraction and GC-MS method was developed for simultaneous quantitative determination of the seven components, including cinnamaldehyde, copaene, cinnamic acid, coumarin, 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde, 2-methoxycinnamic acid and safrole in Cinnamomum cassia. The results showed that methanol and ethanol was not available for extraction of cinnamaldehyde and 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde due to aldol reaction. The developed method was validated to be sensitive, accurate and simple, and was successfully employed for the analysis of 15 samples of C. cassia. The contents of the investigated components were significantly variant and cinnamaldehyde is the most abundant compound, but safrole was not detected in all samples.	c. cassia cinnamaldehyde
2	A new triterpenoid saponin from Abrus precatorius Linn.A new triterpenoid saponin, 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 2)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl subprogenin D (1), together with six known triterpenoids: subprogenin D (2), abrusgenic acid (3), triptotriterpenic acid B (4), abruslactone A (5), abrusogenin (6) and abrusoside C (7) were isolated from the leaves and stems of Abrus precatorius. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of physical and NMR analysis, respectively. Compounds 5 and 6 showed moderate cytotoxicity against MCF-7, SW1990, Hela, and Du-145 cell lines. Compounds 1, 2 and 4 were isolated from this plant for the first time.	abrus precatorius cytotoxicity
1	Fatty acids and carotenes in some ber (Ziziphus jujuba Mill) varieties.Several jujube varieties from the southeast of Spain were analyzed for fatty acid and carotene contents. Triglycerides having medium-chain fatty acids were most abundant in all samples. The main fatty acids were 12:0 (18.3 +/- 9.97), 10:0 (12.5 +/- 19.0), 18:2n6 (9.27 +/- 7.26), 16:1n7 (8.50 +/- 5.77), 16:0 (7.25 +/- 4.35), and 18:1n9 (5.34 +/- 2.52) on total saponifiable oil. The fruits yield 1.33 +/- 0.17 g/100 g saponifiable oil on a dry weight basis. Fatty acid profiles of fruits were found to be influenced by their developmental stage. Multivariable data analyses show that the samples could be grouped on the basis of their fatty acid content. Carotenes were found to be in good agreement with other fruits, varying from 4.12 to 5.98 mg/100 g on a dry weight basis. The contribution to vitamin value reach a mdium of 38 microg RE/100 g on a fresh weight basis.	jujube Triglycerides
1	Potent inhibition of human phosphodiesterase-5 by icariin derivatives.Plant extracts traditionally used for male impotence (Tribulus terrestris, Ferula hermonis, Epimedium brevicornum, Cinnamomum cassia), and the individual compounds cinnamaldehyde, ferutinin, and icariin, were screened against phosphodiesterase-5A1 (PDE5A1) activity. Human recombinant PDE5A1 was used as the enzyme source. Only E. brevicornum extract (80% inhibition at 50 microg/mL) and its active principle icariin (1) (IC50 5.9 microM) were active. To improve its inhibitory activity, 1 was subjected to various structural modifications. Thus, 3,7-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)icaritin (5), where both sugars in 1 were replaced with hydroxyethyl residues, potently inhibited PDE5A1 with an IC50 very close to that of sildenafil (IC50 75 vs 74 nM). Thus, 5 was 80 times more potent than 1, and its selectivity versus phosphodiesterase-6 (PDE6) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate-phosphodiesterase (cAMP-PDE) was much higher in comparison with sildenafil. The improved pharmacodynamic profile and lack of cytotoxicity on human fibroblasts make compound 5 a promising candidate for further development.	e. brevicornum 3,7-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)icaritin
4	Involvement of prohibitin upregulation in abrin-triggered apoptosis.Abrin (ABR), a protein purified from the seeds of Abrus precatorius, induces apoptosis in various types of cancer cells. However, the detailed mechanism remains largely uncharacterized. By using a cDNA microarray platform, we determined that prohibitin (PHB), a tumor suppressor protein, is significantly upregulated in ABR-triggered apoptosis. ABR-induced upregulation of PHB is mediated by the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) pathway, as demonstrated by chemical inhibitors. In addition, ABR significantly induced the expression of Bax as well as the activation of caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in Jurkat T cells, whereas the reduction of PHB by specific RNA interference delayed ABR-triggered apoptosis through the proapoptotic genes examined. Moreover, our results also indicated that nuclear translocation of the PHB-p53 complex may play a role in the transcription of Bax. Collectively, our data show that PHB plays a role in ABR-induced apoptosis, which may be helpful for the development of diagnostic or therapeutic agents.	caspase-3 tumor
2	Solid- and vapor-phase antimicrobial activities of six essential oils: susceptibility of selected foodborne bacterial and fungal strains.The antimicrobial activity of essential oils (EOs) of cinnamon (Cinnamon zeylanicum), clove (Syzygium aromaticum), basil (Ocimum basillicum), rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), dill (Anethum graveolens), and ginger (Zingiber officinalis) was evaluated over a range of concentrations in two types of contact tests (solid and vapor diffusion). The EOs were tested against an array of four Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Listeria monocytogenes), four Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella choleraesuis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and three fungi (a yeast, Candida albicans, and two molds, Penicillium islandicum and Aspergillus flavus). The rationale for this work was to test the possibility of creating a protective atmosphere by using natural compounds that could extend the shelf life of packaged foodstuffs while minimizing organoleptic alterations. In the solid diffusion tests, cinnamon and clove gave the strongest (and very similar) inhibition, followed by basil and rosemary, with dill and ginger giving the weakest inhibition. The fungi were the most sensitive microorganisms, followed by the Gram-positive bacterial strains. The Gram-negative strain P. aeruginosa was the least inhibited. The composition of the atmosphere generated by the EOs, and their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), were determined using a disk volatilization method, in which no inhibition from rosemary or basil was observed. Cinnamon and clove, once again, gave similar results for every microorganism. As a general rule, MIC (fungi) &lt;&lt; MIC (bacteria) with no clear differences between Gram-positive or -negative strains except for P. aeruginosa, which was not inhibited by any of the EOs in the vapor phase. The atmosphere generated from the EOs was analyzed by means of solid-phase microextraction combined with gas chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry. Differences among the volatiles in the EOs, which may be responsible for the differences in their antimicrobial performances, were found.	clove antimicrobial performances
2	Integrated Network Pharmacology Analysis and Pharmacological Evaluation to Explore the Active Components and Mechanism of Abelmoschus manihot (L.) Medik. on Renal Fibrosis.Background: Renal fibrosis is a common pathological outcome of chronic kidney diseases (CKD) that is considered as a global public health issue with high morbidity and mortality. The dry corolla of Abelmoschus manihot (L.) Medik. (AMC) has been used for chronic nephritis in clinic and showed a superior effect in alleviating proteinuria in CKD patients to losartan. However, the effective components and underlying mechanism of AMC in the treatment of renal fibrosis have not been systematically clarified. Methods: Based on drug-likeness evaluation, oral bioavailability prediction and compound contents, a systematic network pharmacology analysis was conducted to predict the active ingredients. Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis and protein-protein interaction analysis were applied to predict the potential pathway and target of AMC against renal fibrosis. The formula of component contribution index (CI) based on the algorithm was used to screen the principal active compounds of AMC in the treatment of renal fibrosis. Finally, pharmacological evaluation was conducted to validate the protective effect and primary predicted mechanism of AMC in the treatment of renal fibrosis on a 5/6 nephrectomy mice model. Results: Fourteen potential active components of AMC possessing favorable pharmacokinetic profiles and biological activities were selected and hit by 17 targets closely related to renal fibrosis. Quercetin, caffeic acid, 9.12-octadecadienoic acid, and myricetin are recognized as the more highly predictive components as their cumulative contribution rate reached 85.86%. The AMC administration on 5/6 nephrectomy mice showed a protective effect on kidney function and renal fibrosis. The hub genes analysis revealed that AMC plays a major role in inhibiting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition during renal fibrosis. Conclusion: Our results predicted active components and potential targets of AMC for the application to renal fibrosis from a holistic perspective, as well as provided valuable direction for further research of AMC and improved comprehension of renal fibrosis pathogenesis.	abelmoschus manihot (l.) medik renal fibrosis
1	Influx of double labelled glutamine into mistletoes (Viscum album) from the xylem sap of its host (Abies alba).The flux of glutamine into the mistletoe Viscum album from the xylem sap of a coniferous host was analyzed. For this purpose, a perfusion system was used in which the xylem sap of the host was replaced by an artificial perfusion solution. With this system, flux rates into the mistletoe were determined in feeding experiments with the organic nitrogen source U(13)C/(15)N-Gln. At the end of the experiments the delta values of C and N were significantly depleted in the outflow compared to the percolation solution. Since this depletion was higher for C than for N, a combination of Gln uptake and simultaneous uploading of organic compounds in the host xylem can be assumed. Gln was strongly metabolized during its allocation in the mistletoe. As a consequence, the C skeleton of Gln was equally distributed between leaf and stem tissue, whereas N of Gln preferentially accumulated in the stem. Apparently, the C atoms of the Gln taken up are transported faster in the mistletoe to the sink tissues than the N atoms. It is concluded that C liberated from Gln is transported rapidly to different sink tissues, whereas N in the oversupplied mistletoes is transported slowly to sinks in the leaves.	viscum album Gln
1	Antibacterial alkaloids from Zanthoxylum rhoifolium.Two new dihydrobenzophenanthridine-type alkaloids, 6-methoxy dioxolo[4',5':4,5]benzo[c] dioxolo[4,5- j]phenanthridine (1) and 2,3,13-trimethoxy-5,11a-dihydro dioxolo[4',5':4,5]benzo[c]phenanthridine (2) were isolated from the stem bark of Zanthoxylum rhoifolium, together with four other previously known benzophenanthridine alkaloids, 6-acetonyldihydronitidine (3) [= 8-acetonyldihydronitidine], 6-acetonyldihydroavicine (4) [= 8-acetonyldihydroavicine], 6-acetonyldihydrochelerythrine (5) and xanthoxyline (6). The structures were elucidated mainly by spectroscopic methods, including 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. For alkaloids 1 and 2 we propose the trivial names rhoifolines A and B. The crude plant extracts and the alkaloids 3, 4 and 6 showed activity against Gram (+/-) bacteria, while the new alkaloids 1 and 2 were inactive.	zanthoxylum rhoifolium alkaloids
1	Therapeutic effects on murine oral candidiasis by oral administration of cassia (Cinnamomum cassia) preparation.We examined the effects of spices and herbs on Candida albicans growth using in vitro assay and therapeutic activity of some selected herbal preparations against murine oral candidiasis. All tested samples: lemongrass (Cymbopogon citratus), lemon balm (Melissa officinalis), thyme (Thymus vulgaris), rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa), green tea (Camellia sinensis), and cassia (Cinnamomum cassia) inhibited Candida mycelial growth in vitro. The results of this assay showed that the anti-Candida activity of lemongrass, green tea, and cassia is stronger than that of the other tested herbs. Oral administration of lemongrass or green tea did not result in significant improvement in the murine oral candidiasis, while the administration of cassia improved the symptoms and reduced the number of viable Candida cells in the oral cavity. The results of in vitro Candida growth assay including GC/MS analysis suggested that cinnamaldehyde in the cassia preparation was the principal component responsible for the inhibitory activity of Candida mycelial growth. These findings suggest that oral intake of a cassia preparation is a clinical candidate for a prophylactic or therapeutic tool against oral Candida infection.	cinnamomum cassia cinnamaldehyde
1	Protective Effect of Selected Medicinal Plants against Hydrogen Peroxide Induced Oxidative Damage on Biological Substrates.Oxidative stress is developed due to susceptibility of biological substrates to oxidation by generation of free radicals. In degenerative diseases, oxidative stress level can be reduced by antioxidants which neutralize free radicals. Primary objective of this work was to screen four medicinal plants, namely, Andrographis paniculata, Costus speciosus, Canthium parviflorum, and Abrus precatorius, for their antioxidant property using two biological substrates-RBC and microsomes. The antioxidative ability of three solvent extracts, methanol (100% and 80%) and aqueous leaf extracts, was studied at different concentrations by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances method using Fenton's reagent to induce oxidation in the substrates. The polyphenol and flavonoid content were analyzed to relate with the observed antioxidant effect of the extracts. The phytochemical screening indicated the presence of flavonoids, polyphenols, tannins, and beta-carotene in the samples. In microsomes, 80% methanol extract of Canthium and Costus and, in RBC, 80% methanol extract of Costus showed highest inhibition of oxidation and correlated well with the polyphenol and flavonoid content. From the results it can be concluded that antioxidants from medicinal plants are capable of inhibiting oxidation in biological systems, suggesting scope for their use as nutraceuticals. 	costus speciosus tannins
1	2-undecanone rich leaf essential oil from Zanthoxylum armatum.The leaf essential oils of Zanthoxylum armatum DC (Rutaceae) from Kumaon, India, extracted by hydrodistillation, were analyzed by capillary gas chromatography (GC-FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The major classes of compounds found in the leaf oils were acyclic and menthane monoterpenoids as well as simple alcohols, aldehydes and ketones. The high proportion of non-terpenic acyclic ketones, notably 2-undecanone and 2-tridecanone, and the low abundance of undec-10-en-1-al and p-phellandren-8-ol make the composition entirely new. Other constituents present in significant amounts were oxygenated monoterpenes, which include 1,8-cineole, linalool, terpinen-4-ol, and alpha-terpineol, and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons represented mainly by trans-caryophyllene, a-humulene and germacrene D. On the contrary, the oil distilled from the leaves on the second day of distillation was characterized by a high content of 2-tridecanone (27.1%) and trans-caryophyllene (7.4%), as compared with 3.5% and 4.6%, respectively, for the fresh leaves; a slight decrease in pH of the distillate was also significant. Moreover, the presence of a high 2-undecanone content followed by 2-tridecanone is being reported for the first time for Z. armatum from this region. In terms of molecular diversity, the simple acyclic ketones dominate the essential oils as compared with linalool that was reported in several previous studies on Z. armatum. Therefore, the two acyclic ketones may be utilized to establish the origin and authenticity of the material.	z. armatum 2-tridecanone
1	Quantification of flavoring constituents in cinnamon: high variation of coumarin in cassia bark from the German retail market and in authentic samples from indonesia.Coumarin is a flavoring which can cause hepatotoxicity in experimental animals and in a proportion of the human population. The tolerable daily intake (TDI) may be exceeded in consumers with high intake of cinnamon containing high levels of coumarin. The objective of this study was to determine these levels in cinnamon samples and to identify possible factors influencing them. A HPLC method to quantify coumarin and related constituents (cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, eugenol) in a single run was used. Results found in 47 cinnamon powder samples obtained from the German retail market confirmed high levels of coumarin in cassia cinnamon. A huge variation was observed in stick samples from two packages (range from below the limit of detection to about 10000 mg/kg). Cassia bark samples of five trees received directly from Indonesia were analyzed additionally. Interestingly, a high variation was observed in one of the trees, whereas no coumarin was detected in the samples of two other trees. In conclusion, coumarin levels in cassia cinnamon can vary widely even within a single tree.	cinnamon coumarin
2	Chemopreventive and anti-breast cancer activity of compounds isolated from leaves of Abrus precatorius L.The present study focuses on isolation and evaluation of the anti-cancer activity of compounds from the leaves of Abrus precatorius. The bioassay-directed strategy was adopted using chromatographic, gas chromatographic-mass spectrum analysis, nuclear magnetic resonance and X-ray crystallography techniques for purification and characterization of active cytotoxic compounds. Further, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines and 7,12-dimethylbenz (a) anthracene (DMBA) induced virgin female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were used for in vitro and in vivo cytotoxicity evaluation. Stigmasterol hemihydrate and 9,12-Octadecadienoic acid (Z,Z)-2-hydroxy-1-(hydroxymethyl)ethyl ester or (beta-monolinolein) were the two main cytotoxic constituents of leaf extract of A. precatorius, with an IC50 value of 74.2 and 13.2 microg/ml, respectively, in MDA-MB-231 cells. Additionally, the treatment with the stigmasterol and beta-monolinolein as a combinatorial drug therapy in DMBA-induced female SD rats led to recovery of body weight, decreased tumor weight and volume, without any toxic side effects. Immunohistochemical examination showed extensive cell death and low proliferation in the treated tumor tissues that was confirmed by results from H and E staining, TUNEL assay and Ki-67 index as compared to control animal group. The reversion of glycoprotein, lysosomal and tumor marker enzyme levels back to near-normal levels after treatment with the plant compounds clearly demonstrated the reduction of tumor burden in these animals. This is the first report on isolation and characterization of the two active cytotoxic components from leaves of A. precatorius. Additionally, the profound cytotoxic and tumor-suppressive effect of these two compounds as a combinatorial therapy provide an alternative option for breast cancer treatment.	a. precatorius breast cancer
4	Inhibition of Akt/mTOR/p70S6K Signaling Activity With Huangkui Capsule Alleviates the Early Glomerular Pathological Changes in Diabetic Nephropathy.Huangkui capsule (HKC), a Chinese modern patent medicine extracted from Abelmoschus manihot (L.) medic, has been widely applied to clinical therapy in the early diabetic nephropathy (DN) patients. However, it remains elusive whether HKC can ameliorate the inchoate glomerular injuries in hyperglycemia. Recently the activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/serine-threonine kinase (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and its downstream regulator, 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K), play important roles in the early glomerular pathological changes of DN including glomerular hypertrophy, glomerular basement membrane (GBM) thickening and mild mesangial expansion. This study thereby aimed to clarify therapeutic effects of HKC during the initial phase of DN and its underlying mechanisms. Fifteen rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: the normal group, the model group and the HKC group. The early DN model rats were induced by unilateral nephrectomy combined with intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin, and administered with either HKC suspension or vehicle after modeling and for a period of 4 weeks. Changes in the incipient glomerular lesions-related parameters in urine and blood were analyzed. Kidneys were isolated for histomorphometry, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and Western blotting (WB) at sacrifice. In vitro, murine mesangial cells (MCs) were used to investigate inhibitory actions of hyperoside (HYP), a bioactive component of HKC, on cellular hypertrophy-associated signaling pathway by WB, compared with rapamycin (RAP). For the early DN model rats, HKC ameliorated micro-urinary albumin, body weight and serum albumin, but had no significant effects on renal function and liver enzymes; HKC improved renal shape, kidney weight and kidney hypertrophy index; HKC attenuated glomerular hypertrophy, GBM thickening and mild mesangial expansion; HKC inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR and p70S6K, and the protein over-expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 in kidneys. In vitro, the phosphorylation of PI3K, Akt, mTOR and p70S6K in MCs induced by high-glucose was abrogated by treatment of HYP or RAP. On the whole, this study further demonstrated HKC safely and efficiently alleviates the early glomerular pathological changes of DN, likely by inhibiting Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling activity in vivo and in vitro, and provided the first evidence that HKC directly contributes to the prevention of the early DN.	mTOR diabetic nephropathy

1	Dynamic changes of flavonoids in Abelmoschus manihot different organs at different growth periods by UPLC-MS/MS.Abelmoschus manihot (Linn.) Medicus has been clinically used to treat chronic kidney disease, oral ulcers, burns, and dysmenorrhea in China for many centuries. The major pharmacologically-active components of A. manihot are flavonoids. In this study, a rapid and highly sensitive UPLC-MS/MS analysis method was established and successfully applied to the simultaneous determination of five major flavonoids (rutin, hyperoside, isoquercitrin, quercetin, and myricetin) in different parts of A. manihot harvested at ten growth periods. Under the optimized chromatographic conditions, good separation for five target components was obtained on an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column within 18min. The total contents of the five investigated flavonoids in A. manihot roots, stems, leaves and flowers ranged from 2.86 to 123.7mug/g, 46.39 to 141.0mug/g, 929.4 to 3096mug/g, and 10,150 to 19,390mug/g, respectively, indicating that the total flavonoids in the four parts could be mainly arranged in a decreasing order as flower&gt;leaf&gt;stem&gt;root. The peak of total flavonoids in flowers and leaves appeared at G8 and G9, respectively. These results will be helpful for the determination of the suitable harvest time of A. manihot and the improvement of the utility value of the disused parts.	a. manihot flavonoids
2	An unusual manifestation of Abrus precatorius poisoning: a report of two cases.Abrus precatorius seeds are highly toxic and are often ingested as a means of suicide in India. Hemorrhagic gastroenteritis with erosions, hemolysis, acute renal damage, hepatotoxicity with elevated liver enzymes, and seizures are common manifestations of toxicity. We report two cases of Abrus precatorius poisoning with raised intracranial pressure (ICP) and papilledema that have not been described earlier in literature. One patient recovered completely with conservative management to lower raised ICP while the other patient expired before effective treatment could be institutedd. The cases are being reported to propose the need for routine fundus examination and brain imaging in severe abrus poisoning with CNS toxicity, as early institution of treatment for cerebral edema measures may be life saving.	abrus precatorius cerebral edema
1	The jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) fruit: a review of current knowledge of fruit composition and health benefits.The nutritional jujube ( Ziziphus jujube Mill.) fruit belonging to the Rhamnaceous family grows mostly in Europe, southern and eastern Asia, and Australia, especially the inland region of northern China. Jujube has a long history of usage as a fruit and remedy. The main biologically active components are vitamin C, phenolics, flavonoids, triterpenic acids, and polysaccharides. Recent phytochemical studies of jujube fruits have shed some light on their biological effects, such as the anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antiobesity, immunostimulating, antioxidant, hepatoprotective, and gastrointestinal protective activities and inhibition of foam cell formation in macrophages. A stronger focus on clinical studies and phytochemical definition of jujube fruits will be essential for future research efforts. This review may be useful for predicting other medicinal uses and potential drug or food interactions and may be beneficial for people living where the jujube fruits are prevalent and health care resources are scarce.	jujube flavonoids
2	In vitro anti-Helicobacter pylori action of 30 Chinese herbal medicines used to treat ulcer diseases.Infection by Helicobacter pylori has been ascertained to be an important etiologic impetus leading usually to chronic active gastritis and gastric ulcer with growing incidences worldwide. Utilizing as the test pathogen a standard and five clinic strains of Helicobacter pylori, the antibacterial action was assessed in vitro with ethanol extracts of 30 Chinese herbal medicines which have been frequently prescribed since ancient times for treating gastritis-like disorders. Among the 30 tested materials, the ethanol extracts of Abrus cantoniensis (Fabaceae), Saussurea lappa (Asteraceae) and Eugenia caryophyllata (Myrtaceae) were strongly inhibitory to all test strains (MICs: approximately 40 microg/ml), and Hippophae rhamnoides (Elaeagnaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii (Liliaceae), Magnolia officinalis and Schisandra chinensis (Magnoliaceae), Corydalis yanhusuo (Papaveraceae), Citrus reticulata (Rutaceae), Bupleurum chinense and Ligusticum chuanxiong (Apiaceae) substantially active with MICs close to 60.0 microg/ml. As to antibacterial actions of the aqueous extracts of the same drugs, those derived from Cassia obtusifolia (Fabaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii and Eugenia caryophyllata were remarkably inhibitory against all the six Helicobacter pylori strains (MICs: approximately 60 microg/ml). The work compared almost quantitatively the magnitude of the anti-Helicobacter pylori actions of the 30 most prescribed gastritis-treating Chinese herbal drugs, and located as well some source plants where potent anti-Helicobacter pylori phytochemicals could be characterized.	eugenia caryophyllata gastric ulcer
1	Non-cell-autonomous postmortem lignification of tracheary elements in Zinnia elegans.Postmortem lignification of xylem tracheary elements (TEs) has been debated for decades. Here, we provide evidence in Zinnia elegans TE cell cultures, using pharmacological inhibitors and in intact Z. elegans plants using Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy, that TE lignification occurs postmortem (i.e., after TE programmed cell death). In situ RT-PCR verified expression of the lignin monomer biosynthetic cinnamoyl CoA reductase and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase in not only the lignifying TEs but also in the unlignified non-TE cells of Z. elegans TE cell cultures and in living, parenchymatic xylem cells that surround TEs in stems. These cells were also shown to have the capacity to synthesize and transport lignin monomers and reactive oxygen species to the cell walls of dead TEs. Differential gene expression analysis in Z. elegans TE cell cultures and concomitant functional analysis in Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in identification of several genes that were expressed in the non-TE cells and that affected lignin chemistry on the basis of pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis. These data suggest that living, parenchymatic xylem cells contribute to TE lignification in a non-cell-autonomous manner, thus enabling the postmortem lignification of TEs.	arabidopsis thaliana lignin
0	Cinnamaldehyde Inhibits the Function of Osteosarcoma by Suppressing the Wnt/beta-Catenin and PI3K/Akt Signaling Pathways.Background: Osteosarcoma (OS) is a primary bone tumor associated with locally aggressive growth and early metastatic potential that typically occurs in children and adolescents. Chinese traditional medicine Cinnamomum cassia Presl has been shown to have significant tumor-killing effect, in which cinnamaldehyde (CA) is the main active ingredient. Purpose: To explore the anticancer effect of CA on the osteosarcoma cells and the possible molecular mechanism. Methods: Crystal violet assay, MTT assay and colony-forming assay were used to confirm the inhibitory role of CA in the proliferation of 143B and MG63 osteosarcoma cells. Hoechst 33258 staining and flow cytometry were used to observe apoptosis. The migration and invasion role of OS cells were evaluated using transwell assays and wound healing assays. Western blotting was used to analyse the protein expression levels. Nude mice were inoculated with 143B cells to establish an orthotopic OS tumor animal model and to investigate the effects of CA on OS tumors. Results: According to crystal violet assay, MTT assay and colony-forming assay, CA significantly inhibited cell proliferation. Hoechst 33258 staining and flow cytometry analysis showed that CA-induced apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, transwell assays and wound healing assays showed that CA inhibited the migration and invasion of osteosarcoma cells. In vivo mouse models, CA inhibited the growth of osteosarcoma. The potential mechanisms could be that CA inhibited the transcriptional activity of Wnt/beta-catenin and PI3K/Akt of the osteosarcoma. Conclusion: CA may inhibit the proliferation, migration, invasion and promote apoptosis of OS cells by inhibiting Wnt/beta-catenin and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. CA may be a potentially effective anti-tumor drug.	Cinnamaldehyde Akt
1	[Analysis and utilization value discussion of multiple chemical composition in different tissues of Abelmoschus manihot].This research is to analyze the resourceful chemical composition in different tissues (root, stem, leaf and flower) of Abelmoschus manihot and evaluate their utilizing value. The flavonoids, soluble polysaccharides, cellulose, nucleosides and amino acids in the different tissues of A. manihot were determined by HPLC coupled with UV-Vis spectrophotpmetry, and UPLC-TQ/MS. The flowers are rich in the resourceful chemical compositions of flavonoids which mainly consist of hyperoside, isoquercitrin, cotton-8-O-glucuronide, myricetin, quercetin-3'-O-glucoside, rutin and quercetin. The total content of these flavonoids is 25.450 mg g-1 in the flowers, while they are trace in the other tissues.Different tissues of A. manihot are rich in soluble polysaccharides and celluloses and the stems have the highest content(19.76%) of soluble polysaccharides, while the roots have the highest content (29.88%) of cellulose. Total of 21 amino acids and 9 nucleosides were detected in this plant, and the flowers have the highest content of amino acids(4.737 mg g-1), while the leaves have the highest content of nucleosides (1.474 mg g-1). A. manihot is rich in the resourceful chemical compositions, and its constituents and contents are various in different tissues of this plant.The results provided a scientific basis for the utilization and industrial development of A. manihot plants.	a. manihot quercetin-3'-O-glucoside
1	Ultrasonic nebulization extraction-heating gas flow transfer-headspace single drop microextraction of essential oil from pericarp of Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim.The ultrasonic nebulization extraction-heating gas flow transfer coupled with headspace single drop microextraction (UNE-HGFT-HS-SDME) was developed for the extraction of essential oil from Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was applied to the determination of the constituents in the essential oil. The contents of the constituents from essential oil obtained by the proposed method were found to be more similar to those obtained by hydro-distillation (HD) than those obtained by ultrasonic nebulization extraction coupled with headspace single drop microextraction (UNE-HS-SDME). The heating gas flow was firstly used in the analysis of the essential oil to transfer the analytes from the headspace to the solvent microdrop. The relative standard deviations for determining the five major constituents were in the range from 1.5 to 6.7%. The proposed method is a fast, sensitive, low cost and small sample consumption method for the determination of the volatile and semivolatile constituents in the plant materials.	zanthoxylum bungeanum maxim essential oil
3	Total flavone of Abelmoschus manihot ameliorates Crohn's disease by regulating the NF-kappaB and MAPK signaling pathways.Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic relapsing form of inflammatory bowel disease, and its pathogenesis remains unknown. Total flavone of Abelmoschus manihot L. Medic (TFA), has been used as anti-inflammatory and myocardial ischemia protective drug. The present study aimed to explore the effects of TFA on CD and its underlying mechanism. We reported that TFA comprises eight flavone glycosides, including quercetin-3-O-robinobioside, gossypetin-3-O-glucoside, quercetin-3'-O-glucoside, isoquercetin, hyperoside, myricetin, gossypetin and quercetin. In vivo, TFA promoted the survival of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in mice, decreased weight loss and increased colon length in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, TFA notably ameliorated the inflammatory response in mice with TNBS-induced colitis as determined by histopathological analysis. In addition, the administration of TFA in mice with TNBS-induced colitis led to a significant decrease in the levels of cytokines in the sera and colon tissues; a significant decrease myeloperoxidase activity in the colon tissues was also observed. These findings may be associated with the suppression of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. In vitro, TFA significantly downregulated the expression of cytokines in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 cells. In addition, TFA suppressed LPS-induced activation of the NF-kappaB and MAPK signaling pathways in RAW264.7 cells. Our findings indicated that TFA could suppress the inflammatory response in mice with TNBS-induced colitis via inhibition of the NF-kappaB and MAPK signaling pathways. The results of the present study may improve understanding of the function of TFA and provide a novel theoretical basis for the treatment of CD.	flavone inflammatory bowel disease
1	Comparative analysis of chemical compositions and antimicrobial activities of essential oils from Abies holophylla and Abies koreana activities of essential oils from Abies holophylla and Abies koreana.The chemical compositions and antibacterial and antifungal activities of essential oils extracted from Abies holophylla and A. koreana were investigated. GC-MS analysis revealed that 38 compounds comprised 95.88% of the A. holophylla essential oil, with the main components being bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-ol (28.05%), delta3-carene (13.85%), alpha-pinene (11.68%), camphene (10.41%), dl-limonene (7.61%), beta-myrcene (7.11%), trans-caryophyllene (5.36%), and alpha- bisabolol (3.67%). In the essential oil from A. koreana, 36 compounds comprised 98.67% of the oil, and the main compounds were bornyl ester (41.79%), camphene (15.31%), alpha-pinene (11.19%), dl-limonene (8.58%), fenchyl acetate (5.55%), and alpha-terpinene (2.29%). Both essential oils showed great potential of antibacterial activity against several bacteria tested, in the range of 2.2-8.8 mug per disc by the agar disc diffusion method, and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 5.5-21.8 mg/ml by the microdilution method. Both oils showed very effective antifungal activities toward all pathogenic strains tested, including Candida glabrata, with MIC values in the range of 0.5-2.2 mg/ml. As a whole, A.koreanaoil showed better antibacterial and antifungal properties than A.holophylla oil.	a. koreana alpha-pinene
1	Inhibitory effects of cinnamic acid on melanin biosynthesis in skin.Cinnamic acid is a wildly distributed phenylpropanoid component naturally occurring in plants, and is mainly found in Cinnamomum cassia BLUME and Panax ginseng. Cinnamic acid was recently reported to exert a tyrosinase inhibitory effect. However, research on melanocytes and animal bodies was not reported until now. In this study, we examined the effects of cinnamic acid on melanin biosynthesis within the melanocytes and brown guinea pigs. Melan-a cells were used to examine the effects of cinnamic acid in the melanocytes. Treatment with 100 ppm of cinnamic acid resulted in a significant reduction of melanin production in the melan-a cells at 29.0%. This compound also exhibited a potent inhibitory effect on tyrosinase activity and reduced tyrosinase expression in the melan-a cells. Moreover, cinnamic acid exhibited depigmenting activity on the UV-B-induced hyperpigmentation of brown guinea pig skin. Our results suggest that cinnamic acid might act as a skin whitening agent via inhibition of tyrosinase activity and expression within melanocytes.	panax ginseng cinnamic acid
4	Improvement of insulin sensitivity in obese Zucker rats by myricetin extracted from Abelmoschus moschatus.In an attempt to develop new substances for treating insulin resistance, obese Zucker rats were employed to screen the effect of myricetin, an active principle of Abelmoschus moschatus (Malvaceae), on insulin resistance. Myricetin purified from the aerial portion of the plant was administered intravenously ( I. V.) into animals. A dose-dependent decrease in the plasma glucose concentration of obese Zucker rats was observed 30 min following an I. V. injection. Moreover, repeated I. V. injection of myricetin (1 mg/kg) into obese Zucker rats 3 times daily for 1 week reduced the value of the glucose-insulin index, an index of insulin resistance calculated from the areas under the curve of glucose and insulin during the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test. Additionally, repeated myricetin treatments overturned the inability of insulin to increase the expression of glucose transporter subtype 4 (GLUT 4) and to increase the protein levels and phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) in soleus muscle of these obese rats. The inability of insulin to increase expression of the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) and to promote Akt serine phosphorylation in soleus muscle of these rats were also overturned by repeated myricetin treatments. These findings indicate that myricetin improves insulin sensitivity through increased post-receptor insulin signaling mediated by enhancements in IRS-1-associated PI3-kinase and GLUT 4 activity in muscles of obese Zucker rats. Myricetin might be used as a model substance for the development of antidiabetic compounds.	glucose-insulin IRS-1
1	Seed oil and fatty acid content in okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) and related species.Approximately 1100 genebank accessions of okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) and 540 additional accessions that included six of its related species-A. caillei, A. crinitis, A. esculentus, A. ficulneus, A. manihot, A. moschatus and A. tuberculatus-were evaluated for seed oil content using time domain NMR (TD-NMR). Oil content in seed of A. caillei, A. esculentus, A. ficulneus, A. manihot, A. moschatus and A. tuberculatus was in the ranges 2.51-13.61%, 12.36-21.56%, 6.62-16.7%, 16.1-22.0%, 10.3-19.8% and 10.8-23.2%, respectively. Accession PI639680 (A. tuberculatus) had the highest seed oil content (~23%). Accessions of A. esculentus with high seed oil content included PI nos. PI274350 (21.5%), PI538082 (20.9%) and PI538097 (20.9%). Values for the three accessions of A. manihot with the highest seed oil content were PI nos. PI639673 (20.4%), PI639674 (20.9%) and PI639675 (21.9%), all representing var. tetraphyllus. Average percent seed oil in materials of A. esculentus from Turkey and Sudan (17.35% and 17.36%, respectively) exceeded the averages of materials from other locations. Ninety-eight accessions (total of six species) were also examined for fatty acid composition. Values of linoleic acid ranged from 23.6-50.65% in A. esculentus. However, mean linoleic acid concentrations were highest in A. tuberculatus and A. ficulneus. Concentrations of palmitic acid were significantly higher in A. esculentus (range of 10.3-36.35%) when compared to that of other species, and reached a maximum in PI489800 Concentrations of palmitic acid were also high in A. caillei (mean = ~30%). Levels of oleic acid were highest in A. manihot, A. manihot var. tetraphyllus and A. moschatus.	a. moschatus oleic acid
4	Apoptosis induction of 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde as a proteasome inhibitor is associated with ER stress and mitochondrial perturbation in cancer cells.2'-Hydroxycinnamaldehyde (HCA), isolated from the stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia, and 2'-benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde (BCA), one of HCA derivatives, have antiproliferative activities on several human cancer cell lines. Our previous study suggested that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and caspase-3 are the major regulators of HCA-induced apoptosis. In the present study, we demonstrated a novel molecular target using in vitro pull-down assay by biotin-labeled HCA (biotin-HCA) in SW620 cells. We analyzed 11 differential spots of 2-dimensional gel prepared with pull-downed proteins by biotin-HCA. Among them, five spots were identified as proteasome subunits. An in vitro 26S proteasome function assay using specific fluorogenic substrates showed that HCA potently inhibits L3-like activity of the proteasome. In addition, HCA showed inhibitory action against chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and PGPH-like activities. DNA microarray showed that HCA induced heat shock family and ER stress-responsive genes, which reflects the accumulation of misfolded proteins by proteasome inhibition. On western blot analysis, it was confirmed that HCA induces glucose-regulated protein, 78 kDa (GRP78) and some representative endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-responsive proteins. Furthermore, HCA treatment decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. The effect of HCA on cytochrome c and Bax translocation between cytosol and mitochondrial membrane was clarified using western blot analysis. These results suggest that HCA-induced apoptosis is associated with the inhibition of the proteasome activity that leads in turn to the increase of ER stress and mitochondrial perturbation.

2	Destabilization of Alzheimer's Abeta42 Protofibrils with a Novel Drug Candidate wgx-50 by Molecular Dynamics Simulations.Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common dementia. The aggregation and deposition of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) in neural tissue is its characteristic symptom. To destabilize and dissolve Abeta fibrils, a number of candidate molecules have been proposed. wgx-50 is a compound extracted from Sichuan pepper (Zanthoxylum bungeanum) and a potential candidate drug for treating AD. Our early experiments show it is effective in disassembling Abeta42 aggregations. A series of molecular dynamics simulations were performed in this work to explain the molecular mechanism of the destabilization of Abeta42 protofibril by wgx-50. It is found that there were three possible stable binding sites including two sites in hydrophobic grooves on surface of Abeta protofibril that made no significant changes in Abeta structures and one site in the interior that caused destabilization of the protofibril. In this site, wgx-50 was packed against the side chains of I32 and L34, disrupted the D23-K28 salt bridges, and partially opened the tightly compacted two beta-sheets. The results were confirmed by simulations at 320 K, where deeper insertion of wgx-50 into the whole protofibril was observed. The molecular mechanism of this novel drug candidate wgx-50 to disaggregate Abeta protofibril may provide some insight into the strategy of structure-based drug design for AD. 	zanthoxylum bungeanum AD
1	Antiinflammatory effects of essential oil from the leaves of Cinnamomum cassia and cinnamaldehyde on lipopolysaccharide-stimulated J774A.1 cells.Cassia oil (CO) from different parts of Cinnamomum cassia have different active components. Very few pharmacological properties of cassia leaf oil have been reported. This study investigated and compared effects of cassia leaf oil and cinnamaldehyde on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated J774A.1 cells. Volatile compositions in cassia leaf oil were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS)/MS. Effects of CO and cinnamaldehyde on LPS-activated J774A.1 cells were investigated by determining nitric oxide (NO) production using Griess reaction assay; expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, enzymes involve in inflammatory mediators; antiinflammatory cytokines, and iron exporter ferroportin1 (Fpn1) using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; and production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) and interleukin (IL)-10 using ELISA. The main component of CO was cinnamaldehyde. Both oils at 1-20 mug/ml markedly inhibited NO production in LPS-activated J774A.1 cells with IC50 value of 6.1 +- 0.25 and 9.97 +- 0.35 mug/ml, respectively. They similarly inhibited mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. These mediators included TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha in LPS-activated cells. They also significantly decreased expression of inducible enzymes inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, microsomal prostaglandin-E synthase-1. In the opposite way, they increased mRNA expression and the production of antiinflammatory cytokines IL-10 and transforming growth factor-beta. In addition, they promoted the expression of Fpn1. These results demonstrated that inhibitory effects of cassia leaf oil from C. cassia mainly came from cinnamaldehyde. This compound not only inhibited inflammatory mediators but also activated antiinflammatory mediators in LPS-activated J774A.1 cells. It may also have an effect on iron regulatory proteins in activated macrophages. 	c. cassia cinnamaldehyde
2	Screening of some Tanzanian medicinal plants for their trypanocidal and cytotoxic activities.The objective of the present study was to evaluate in vitro antitrypanosomal and cytotoxic activities of crude extracts of 20 traditionally used medicinal plants of Tanzania. A total of 40 extracts (dichloromethane and methanol) were screened for antiproliferative activity of bloodstream form of T. b. brucei and human leukaemia HL-60 cell. Inhibition of cell proliferation was assessed using resazurin as vital stain. Of the 40 extracts tested, the dichloromethane extract from bark of Warburgia salutaris (Canellaceae) exhibited the most potent antitrypanosomal activity with an IC(50) value of 10.68 microg/ml. A dichloromethane extract from Lannea stuhlmannii (Anacardiaceae) was found to be the most cytotoxic extract against HL-60 (IC(50) = 27.15 microg/ml). Out of the 20 plants tested, 5 plants exhibited trypanocidal activity with IC(50) values below 20 microg/ml. These 5 plants: Entandrophragma bussei (Meliaceae), Securidaca longepedunculata (Polygalaceae), Warburgia salutaris (Canellaceae), Zanha africana (Sapindaceae) and Zanthoxylum chalybeum (Rutaceae) could therefore serve as sources of lead compounds for treatment of trypanosomiasis.	warburgia salutaris trypanosomiasis
1	Antibacterial benzofuran neolignans and benzophenanthridine alkaloids from the roots of Zanthoxylum capense.Two new 2-arylbenzofuran neolignans and a new benzophenanthridine alkaloid, together with six known benzophenanthridine alkaloids, namely, decarine, norchelerythrine, dihydrochelerythrine, 6-acetonyldihydrochelerythrine, tridecanonchelerythrine, and 6-acetonyldihydronitidine, have been isolated from the MeOH extract of the roots of Zanthoxylum capense. Their structures were elucidated by means of spectroscopic techniques including 2D NMR experiments. All the isolated compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Some compounds showed significant inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 with MIC values ranging from 12.5 to 50 mug/mL.	zanthoxylum capense tridecanonchelerythrine
4	Total flavone of Abelmoschus manihot ameliorates Crohn's disease by regulating the NF-kappaB and MAPK signaling pathways.Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic relapsing form of inflammatory bowel disease, and its pathogenesis remains unknown. Total flavone of Abelmoschus manihot L. Medic (TFA), has been used as anti-inflammatory and myocardial ischemia protective drug. The present study aimed to explore the effects of TFA on CD and its underlying mechanism. We reported that TFA comprises eight flavone glycosides, including quercetin-3-O-robinobioside, gossypetin-3-O-glucoside, quercetin-3'-O-glucoside, isoquercetin, hyperoside, myricetin, gossypetin and quercetin. In vivo, TFA promoted the survival of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in mice, decreased weight loss and increased colon length in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, TFA notably ameliorated the inflammatory response in mice with TNBS-induced colitis as determined by histopathological analysis. In addition, the administration of TFA in mice with TNBS-induced colitis led to a significant decrease in the levels of cytokines in the sera and colon tissues; a significant decrease myeloperoxidase activity in the colon tissues was also observed. These findings may be associated with the suppression of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways.

Our findings indicated that TFA could suppress the inflammatory response in mice with TNBS-induced colitis via inhibition of the NF-kappaB and MAPK signaling pathways. The results of the present study may improve understanding of the function of TFA and provide a novel theoretical basis for the treatment of CD.	NF-kappaB crohn's disease
3	Total flavone of Abelmoschus manihot suppresses epithelial-mesenchymal transition via interfering transforming growth factor-beta1 signaling in Crohn's disease intestinal fibrosis.AIM: To explore the role and mechanism of total flavone of Abelmoschus manihot (TFA) on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progress of Crohn's disease (CD) intestinal fibrosis. METHODS: First, CCK-8 assay was performed to assess TFA on the viability of intestinal epithelial (IEC-6) cells and select the optimal concentrations of TFA for our further studies. Then cell morphology, wound healing and transwell assays were performed to examine the effect of TFA on morphology, migration and invasion of IEC-6 cells treated with TGF-beta1. In addition, immunofluorescence, real-time PCR analysis (qRT-PCR) and western blotting assays were carried out to detect the impact of TFA on EMT progress. Moreover, western blotting assay was performed to evaluate the function of TFA on the Smad and MAPK signaling pathways. Further, the role of co-treatment of TFA and si-Smad or MAPK inhibitors has been examined by qRT-PCR, western blotting, morphology, wound healing and transwell assays. RESULTS: In this study, TFA promoted transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1)-induced (IEC-6) morphological change, migration and invasion, and increased the expression of epithelial markers and reduced the levels of mesenchymal markers, along with the inactivation of Smad and MAPK signaling pathways. Moreover, we revealed that si-Smad and MAPK inhibitors effectively attenuated TGF-beta1-induced EMT in IEC-6 cells. Importantly, co-treatment of TFA and si-Smad or MAPK inhibitors had better inhibitory effects on TGF-beta1-induced EMT in IEC-6 cells than either one of them. CONCLUSION: These findings could provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms of TFA on TGF-beta1-induced EMT in IEC-6 cells and TFA is expected to advance as a new therapy to treat CD intestinal fibrosis.	flavone crohn's disease
1	Effects of Tapinanthus globiferus and Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides extracts on human leukocytes in vitro.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at investigating the genotoxicity and cytotoxicity effect of Tapinanthus globiferus and Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides to human leukocytes. In addition, the reductive potential and the chemical composition of the two plant extracts were also determined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human leukocytes were obtained from healthy volunteer donors. The genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of T. globiferus and Z. zanthoxyloides were assessed using the comet assay and trypan blue exclusion, respectively. The antioxidant activity of the plant extracts was evaluated by the reducing power assay. Furthermore, high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector was used to characterize and quantify the constituents of these plants. RESULTS: T. globiferus (10-150 microg/mL) was neither genotoxic nor cytotoxic at the concentrations tested, suggesting that it can be consumed safely at relatively high concentrations. However, Z. zanthoxyloides showed cytoxicity and genotoxicity to human leukocytes at the highest concentration tested (150 microg/mL). In addition, the total reducing power of T. globiferus was found higher than Z. zanthoxyloides in potassium ferricyanide reduction. Both plants extract contained flavonoids (rutin and quercetin) and phenolic acids (chlorogenic and caffeic). CONCLUSION: The results obtained support the fact that some caution should be paid regarding the dosage and the frequency of use of Z. zanthoxyloides extract.	z. zanthoxyloides flavonoids
1	Seasonal variation in the leaf essential oil composition of Zanthoxylum clava-herculis growing in Huntsville, Alabama.The seasonal variation in the chemical composition of the leaf essential oil of Zanthoxylum clava-herculis has been analyzed by GC-MS. Three individual trees were sampled four times during the course of the 2004 growing season. Notable differences were recorded in the essential oil yields from the three trees on the four collection dates; yields were highest in May and lowest in July. The leaf essential oils were made up of 25 components, largely menthane monoterpenoids, dominated by limonene (44-73%) and 1,8-cineole (16-43%), with lesser amounts of alpha-thujene, linalool, gamma-terpinene, and alpha-terpineol. The ratio of oxygenated monoterpenoids to monoterpene hydrocarbons generally increased during the season, largely reflected in the 1,8-cineole/limonene ratio.	zanthoxylum clava-herculis alpha-thujene
1	Identification of the potential active components of Abelmoschus manihot in rat blood and kidney tissue by microdialysis combined with ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry.In this paper, microdialysis combining with ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) was applied to simultaneously identify components in blood and kidney dialysis after oral administration of Abelmoschus manihot extract. Microdialysis probe was implanted in the jugular vein and the kidney medulla, respectively; microdialysis samples were collected continuously, transferred to microtubes and analyzed by UPLC-Q-TOF/MS. The components in microdialysis samples were separated by an UPLC HSS T3 column and eluted with acetonitrile and water (containing 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The results showed that unbound constituents in blood circulation of the rat include hyperoside, isoquercitrin, quercetin monoglucuronide, quercetin-3'-O-glucoside, quercetin, myricetin, and hibifolin while unbound constituents in kidney are hyperoside, isoquercitrin, quercetin monoglucuronide, which might be the potential active components in vivo. The developed method was simple and reliable, and could be adopted to rapidly screen and identify potential active components contributing to pharmacological effects of TCM and to better clarify its action mechanism.	abelmoschus manihot hyperoside
2	Attempted suicide, by mail order: Abrus precatorius.OBJECTIVE: Abrus precatorius is cultivated in many subtropical areas. The seeds exist in a variety of colors such as black, orange, and most commonly, glossy red. A black band is found at the end of the seed. The plant contains multiple pods which typically contain three to five Abrus seeds. The seeds contain abrin, which inhibits ribosomal function, halting protein synthesis and leading to cellular death. A unique aspect of this case is the use of the internet to order a potentially lethal poison as well as transmission of a picture to identify the seed. CASE REPORT: A 20-year-old man presented to the emergency department complaining of vomiting and watery diarrhea for 6-8 h prior to arrival. He denied any medication use, recent illness, travel, or changes in his diet. Initial vital signs were normal. The patient was diagnosed with viral gastroenteritis. During his evaluation, the patient admitted to feeling suicidal. While awaiting psychiatry evaluation, the patient's father arrived with a box of small hard red seeds, which he believed that his son ingested in a suicide attempt. The seeds could not be identified by the staff. A picture of the seeds was transmitted by e-mail to the New York City Poison Control Center, allowing their identification as A. precatorius. The patient was reinterviewed and admitted to chewing and swallowing 10 seeds. Given the potential toxicity of abrin, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. He continued to have frequent episodes of emesis as well as diarrhea. He gradually improved over 2 days. He admitted to ordering a box of Abrus seeds online from Asia after reading on the Internet about their use in suicide. He was eventually discharged for outpatient follow-up with no permanent sequelae. CONCLUSION: Abrin has an estimated human fatal dose of 0.1-1 mug/kg. Most cases of Abrus seed ingestions are unintentional and occur in children. Ingesting the intact seeds typically results in no clinical findings, as they pass through the gastrointestinal tract due to their hard shell. Abrin released during chewing is poorly absorbed systemically from the gastrointestinal tract. This causes the vomiting and diarrhea with resultant hypovolemia and electrolyte disturbances, which can be severe and life threatening, particularly in areas with less advanced health care systems. Management is primarily supportive.	a. precatorius gastrointestinal tract
3	Preventive Effects of Total Flavonoid C-Glycosides from Abrus mollis on Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease through Activating the PPARalpha Signaling Pathway.Abrus pulchellus subsp. mollis (Hance) Verdc. (Leguminosae) is a well-known edible plant usually added to soups and beverages. In this study, vicenin-2 (1: ), isoschaftoside (2: ), schaftoside (3: ), and their enrichment fraction, total flavonoid C-glycosides, derived from the extracts of A. mollis, were firstly found to prevent nonalcoholic fatty liver disease both in vitro and in vivo. In the in vitro study, total flavonoid C-glycosides decreased the lipid accumulation in oleic acid-treated HepG2 cells. The mechanisms of total flavonoid C-glycosides are involved in the regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha and its downstream, and the reduction of proinflammatory cytokines. In high-fat diet-induced fatty liver rats, total flavonoid C-glycosides decreased the levels of glutamic-oxalacetic transaminease and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, and decreased the lipid accumulation both in the liver and blood without affecting food intake. In addition, total flavonoid C-glycosides also increased the activities of the antioxidant enzyme system in vivo. In conclusion, total flavonoid C-glycosides are active components of A. mollis on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and can be used in functional food and supplements for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease prevention and treatment.	flavonoid c-glycosides nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
2	Medicinal Plants Targeting Cardiovascular Diseases in View of Avicenna.BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a spectrum of diseases involving the heart and blood vessels, and the first cause of mortality worldwide. Medicinal plants have been used for thousands of years to treat CVD. In Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM), there is a special focus on heart diseases. Avicenna, a Persian physician of the eleventh century compiled a book devoted to this field named "The treatise on cardiac drugs" which is a compendium of TPM knowledge on CVD. Avicenna mentioned 50 cardiovascular active plants and described their therapeutic effects in the treatment of CVDs. METHODS: Here, we perform a detailed search in scientific databases to verify the cardiovascular activities of the medicinal plants suggested by Avicenna. Also, we discussed cardiovascular activities of a number of the most important suggested plants as well as their efficacy in clinical studies. Major bioactive compounds identified from these plants are also discussed. RESULTS: Pharmacological studies have revealed that the majority of these plants are effective in cardiovascular health with various mechanisms. Among them, Crocus sativus L., Cinnamomum cassia (L.) J. Presl, Punica granatum L., Ocimum basilicum L., Elettaria cardamomum (L.) Maton, Melissa officinalis L. and Phyllanthus emblica L. have proved to be more effective. CONCLUSION: The above-mentioned plants can be rich sources for developing new and effective pharmaceuticals for the treatment of CVDs.	ocimum basilicum l cardiovascular disease
2	Inhibition of Trypanosoma cruzi by plant extracts used in Chinese medicine.In this work, we assessed the effect of extracts obtained from 17 plants used in traditional Chinese medicine. These extracts were tested in vitro with the epimastigote form of Trypanosoma cruzi, clone Bra C(15) C(2), at 27 degrees C in F-29 medium at a concentration of 100 microg/ml in axenic cultures. Allopurinol was used as reference drug. Seven plant extracts showed inhibitory activities lower than 25%. Pueraria lobata, Mahonia beaei, Dictamus dasycarpus, Kochia scoparia, Sophora flavescens and Ligustrum lucidum showed effects with inhibition values between 25% and 60%, whereas Lithospermum erythrorhizon, Saussurea lappa, Melia toosendan and Cinnamomum cassia showed the greatest inhibitory activity of 100%. The IC(50) of these extracts were: 0.4, 2.4, 1.8 and 3.9 microg/ml, respectively. The MTT assay was made and did not show cytotoxic activity. These results allowed us to suggest that L. erythrorhizon, S. lappa, M. toosendan and C. cassia could be a source of new compounds against T. cruzi.	l. erythrorhizon inhibitory activities

4	Cinnamaldehyde induces apoptosis and reverses epithelial-mesenchymal transition through inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in non-small cell lung cancer.Cinnamaldehyde, the main chemical component of the essential oil separated from the traditional herb Cinnamomum cassia, has been demonstrated to be an efficient cytotoxic agent against several human cancers. The present experiment showed that cinnamaldehyde dose-dependently depresses the proliferation of three types of NSCLC cells and induces cell apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, cinnamaldehyde attenuated CoCl2-induced EMT and decreased matrix metalloprotease (MMP) family while the in vivo study showed the same trend. Mechanistically, cinnamaldehyde imitated the suppressive effect of XAV939 on cell motility and EMT which could be impaired by LiCl. Collectively, our research demonstrated for the first time that cinnamaldehyde is able to inhibit NSCLC cell growth by inducing apoptosis and reverse EMT through terminating Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, which might supply further insight into cinnamaldehyde-mediated anti-tumor effect against NSCLC for better prognosis.	beta-catenin NSCLC
1	Efficient quantification of the phenolic profiles of Zanthoxylum bungeanum leaves and correlation between chromatographic fingerprint and antioxidant activity.Sixteen subsequent fractions were prepared from the ethyl acetate fraction of Zanthoxylum bungeanum leaves after bio-guided chromatographic separation. The HPLC profiles and antioxidant activity of the various fractions indicated that the content of eight phenolic compounds (chlorogenic acid, epicatechin, rutin, hyperoside, trifolin, quercitrin, afzelin and quercetin) and antioxidant activity vary significantly, and high concentrations of a combination of eight phenolic compounds would result in an increase of the antioxidant activity. These results suggested that the eight compounds could be used as chemical markers for quality assessment of Z. bungeanum leaves. Correlation between chromatographic fingerprint and antioxidant activity of the fractions showed that quercitrin and hyperoside play crucial roles in the antioxidant activity, and they can be seen as the milestone for quality control. The findings also suggested that five obtained fractions (E-3-3, E-2-4, E-7, E-5 and E-4) could become useful supplements for functional food ingredients and health-related products. 	z. bungeanum quercetin
1	A new cytotoxic phenylbutenoid dimer from the rhizomes of Zingiber cassumunar.A new phenylbutenoid dimer, (+/-)- trans-3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-4-[(E)-3,4-dimethoxystyryl]cyclohex-1-ene, was isolated from the rhizomes of Zingiber cassumunar along with the three known compounds, (+/-)- trans-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-[(E)-3,4-dimethoxystyryl]cyclohex-1-ene, 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)but-1,3-diene, and 4-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)but-1,3-diene by bioassay-directed fractionation using the A549 human cancer cell line cytotoxicity assay. Structure of the new compound was elucidated by spectral analysis, including 1D and 2D NMR experiments.	zingiber cassumunar phenylbutenoid
1	New polyunsaturated fatty acid amides isolated from the seeds of Zanthoxylum piperitum.Five linear fatty acid amides (1-5) of the sandshool class, including two new compounds, were isolated from Zanthoxylum piperitum seeds. Based on combined spectral analyses, the structures of new compounds 4 and 5 were determined to be 2',3'-dihydroxy-alpha-sanshool and 2',3'-dihydroxy-beta-sanshool, respectively. These compounds exhibited weak cytotoxicity in the A-549 (human lung cancer) cell line.	zanthoxylum piperitum 2',3'-dihydroxy-beta-sanshool
3	Simultaneous Detection of Flavonoids, Phenolic Acids and Alkaloids in Abri Herba and Abri Mollis Herba using Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry.INTRODUCTION: Abri Herba has remarkable properties, such as cleanup heat detoxification, dampness and activating blood circulation to dissipate blood stasis; as a result, it has been applied to treat acute or chronic hepatitis and mastitis. Abri mollis Herba is often used as Abri Herba. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was applied to compare the similarities and differences of the chemical compositions in the two types of medicinal materials. OBJECTIVE: To establish a high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous analysis of 15 flavonoids, two phenolic acids and three alkaloids in Abri Herba and Abri mollis Herba. METHODOLOGY: The chromatographic separation was performed on a C18 column with a mobile phase of methanol (A), acetonitrile (B) and 0.5% acetic acid in water (C) using gradient elution. The detection of the target compounds was performed in multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) mode using a hybrid quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with positive/negative ion-switching electrospray ionisation (ESI) source. RESULTS: The developed method is reliable, sensitive and specific. In addition, the method has been successfully applied to differentiate 15 batches of Abri Herba and 27 batches of Abri mollis Herba stems. Furthermore, a comparison of the contents among stems, roots and leaves from the same strain in seven batches of Abri mollis Herba and four batches of Abri Herba has also been performed. CONCLUSION: HPLC-MS/MS method is sensitive and selective and can be suitable for the reliable quality control of Abri mollis Herba and Abri Herba.	flavonoids hepatitis and mastitis
1	Validation of a high-performance liquid chromatography method for the determination of (-)-alpha-bisabolol from particulate systems.A reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography method has been developed and validated for determination and quantitation of the natural sesquiterpene (-)-alpha-bisabolol. Furthermore the application of the method was done by characterization of chitosan milispheres and liposomes entrapping Zanthoxylum tingoassuiba essential oil, which contains appreciable amount of (-)-alpha-bisabolol. A reversed-phase C(18) column and gradient elution was used with the mobile phase composed of (A) acetonitrile-water-phosphoric acid (19:80:1) and (B) acetonitrile. The eluent was pumped at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min with UV detection at 200 nm. In the range 0.02-0.64 mg/mL the assay showed good linearity (R(2 )= 0.9999) and specificity for successful identification and quantitation of (-)-alpha-bisabolol in the essential oil without interfering peaks. The method also showed good reproducibility, demonstrating inter-day and intra-day precision based on relative standard deviation values (up to 3.03%), accuracy (mean recovery of 100.69% +/- 1.05%) and low values of detection and quantitation limits (0.0005 and 0.0016 mg/mL, respectively). The method was also robust for showing a recovery of 98.81% under a change of solvent in standard solutions. The suitability of the method was demonstrated by the successful determination of association efficiency of the (-)-alpha-bisabolol in chitosan milispheres and liposomes.	zanthoxylum tingoassuiba (-)-alpha-bisabolol

1	Tyrosinase-inhibitory constituents from the twigs of Cinnamomum cassia.A methanol extract of the twigs of Cinnamomum cassia was found to possess inhibitory activity against tyrosinase. Purification of the MeOH extract afforded four new phenolics, cassiferaldehyde (6), icariside DC (9), cinnacassinol (10), and dihydrocinnacasside (13), together with 10 known compounds (1-5, 7-12, and 14). The structures of the new compounds were determined by spectroscopic data interpretation. Compounds 1-6 and 8-13 showed strong inhibitory activity against tyrosinase, with IC(50) values ranging from 0.24 to 0.94 mM.	cinnamomum cassia icariside dc
1	Phenolic compounds of Abies nephrolepis and their NO production inhibitory activities.Two new, i.e., 1 and 2, and 69 known phenolics were isolated from the aerial parts of Abies nephrolepis. These chemical constituents included 22 lignans, 30 flavonoids, and 19 other phenols. Their structures were determined mainly by analysis of the 1D- and 2D-NMR spectroscopic data. All the 71 isolates were evaluated for their inhibitory activities against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NO production in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Compound 1 exhibited a potent effect with an IC(50) value of 13.7 mug/ml.	abies nephrolepis phenols
1	Differential antiproliferation effect of 2'-benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde in K-ras-transformed cells via downregulation of thiol antioxidants.2'-Benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde (BCA), one of the derivatives of 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (HCA) isolated from the bark of Cinnamomum cassia, induces apoptosis in human cancer cells. We found that BCA induces stronger antiproliferative effects in K-ras-transformed cells (RK3E-ras) than in isogenic non-transformed cells (RK3E). Treatment of RK3E-ras with BCA resulted in increased ROS generation and depletion of intracellular glutathione, whereas BCA-treated RK3E showed no significant increase in the ROS level with concurrent increase in intracellular glutathione (GSH). Thiol antioxidants recovered cell proliferation inhibition caused by BCA in both cell lines, while non-thiol antioxidants failed to recover cell death. BCA decreased metallothionein (MT) expression in RK3E-ras, while inducing remarkable MT expression in RK3E. The increase of intracellular GSH in RK3E is partially caused by differential induction of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS) due to BCA treatment. To evaluate the upstream pathway for differential expression of gamma-GCS and MT, we analyzed early DJ-1 (PARK7) and NF-E2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) changes after BCA treatment. In RK3E, DJ-1 expression considerably increased for 3 h with concurrent induction of Nrf2, whereas in RK3E-ras cells BCA decreased these protein levels. Based on these findings, it seems that the therapeutic selectivity of BCA in RK3E-ras results from decreased thiol antioxidants via decreased DJ-1 and Nrf2 expression.	cinnamomum cassia BCA
1	Cloning and molecular characterization of the basic peroxidase isoenzyme from Zinnia elegans, an enzyme involved in lignin biosynthesis.The major basic peroxidase from Zinnia elegans (ZePrx) suspension cell cultures was purified and cloned, and its properties and organ expression were characterized. The ZePrx was composed of two isoforms with a M(r) (determined by matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization time of flight) of 34,700 (ZePrx34.70) and a M(r) of 33,440 (ZePrx33.44). Both isoforms showed absorption maxima at 403 (Soret band), 500, and 640 nm, suggesting that both are high-spin ferric secretory class III peroxidases. M(r) differences between them were due to the glycan moieties, and were confirmed from the total similarity of the N-terminal sequences (LSTTFYDTT) and by the 99.9% similarity of the tryptic fragment fingerprints obtained by reverse-phase nano-liquid chromatography. Four full-length cDNAs coding for these peroxidases were cloned. They only differ in the 5'-untranslated region. These differences probably indicate different ways in mRNA transport, stability, and regulation. According to the k(cat) and apparent K(m)(RH) values shown by both peroxidases for the three monolignols, sinapyl alcohol was the best substrate, the endwise polymerization of sinapyl alcohol by both ZePrxs yielding highly polymerized lignins with polymerization degrees &gt; or =87. Western blots using anti-ZePrx34.70 IgGs showed that ZePrx33.44 was expressed in tracheary elements, roots, and hypocotyls, while ZePrx34.70 was only expressed in roots and young hypocotyls. None of the ZePrx isoforms was significantly expressed in either leaves or cotyledons. A neighbor-joining tree constructed for the four full-length cDNAs suggests that the four putative paralogous genes encoding the four cDNAs result from duplication of a previously duplicated ancestral gene, as may be deduced from the conserved nature and conserved position of the introns.	zinnia elegans glycan
1	[Determination of cinnamic acid in Cinnamomum cassia presl after compatibility in Coptis chinensis Franch].OBJECTIVE: Studying changes of chemical constituents of Cinnamomum cassia after compatibility in Coptis chinensis; determining the amount of cinnamic acid in the decoction. METHOD: An YWG C18 column was used with a mobile phase of CH3CN-0.01% H3PO4(27:73), the flow rate was 1.0 ml.min-1 and the detection wavelength was 280 nm. RESULT AND CONCLUSION: The calibration curve of cinnamic acid had good linear relationship in the range of 0.112-4.48 micrograms. The average recovery was 100.0%, the relative standard deviation was 0.66%. The amount of cinnamic acid was decreased in the decoction, and the decreased degree was related with the ratio of C. chinensis to C. cassia.	c. cassia cinnamic acid
2	Histochemical localization of glycoconjugates in the developing endolymphatic sac and vestibular end organs of the mouse.The distribution of glycoconjugates in the endolymphatic sac (ES) and vestibular end organs from the 12th gestational day (GD) in the developing mouse to the 6th day after birth was analyzed using six biotinylated lectins: wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), Abrus precatorius agglutinin (APA), Ulex europaeus agglutinin I (UEA-I), Ricinus communis agglutinin 120 (RCA120), Helix pomatia agglutinin (HPA), concanavalin A (conA). In the 13th and 15th GD sections, the luminal contents in the fetal ES were strongly labelled with lectins, while only a small amount of substance in the ES was labelled with lectins after the 17th GD. In the 13th GD sections, before the cupula and otoconia were formed, the fetal ES started to produce glycoconjugates labelled with WGA, APA, RCA120 and ConA. In the 17th GD sections, the immature cupula and otoconia were strongly labelled with WGA, APA and RCA120. Sugar residues stained by lectins detected in the substance of the fetal ES were the same as those found in the immature cupula and otoconia. HPA only stained the ES epithelium around the 13th and 15th GD. The fetal ES may interact with the formation of the cupula and otoconia, especially in the early stage during evolution and that HPA-reactive glycoconjugates may be related to the intracellular elements of the ES epithelium only during a well-defined phase of development.	helix pomatia otoconia
1	UHPLC-TOFMS coupled with chemometric method as a powerful technique for rapid exploring of differentiating components between two Ziziphus species.To rapidly explore the differentiating components and the potential chemical markers for discrimination between those Chinese medicinal herbs with similar chemical characteristics, an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-TOFMS coupled with multivariate statistical analysis method was proposed and validated by using two Ziziphus species (Z. jujuba and Z. jujuba var. spinosa) as the model herbs. After the samples were analyzed using UHPLC-TOFMS, the data sets of retention time (RT)-m/z pairs, ion intensities and sample codes were further processed with orthogonal partial least squared discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) to holistically compare the difference between the fruits of these two Ziziphus species, and to generate an S-plot. Those compounds correlating to the points at the two ends of "S" were regarded as the most differentiating components between these two kinds of samples. By comparing the mass/UV spectra and retention times with those of reference compounds, these components were finally characterized as zizyberenalic acid, palmitoleic acid, oleic acid, pomonic acid and rutin, and these compounds would be the potential chemical markers for discrimination of these jujube products. The results suggested that this newly established approach could be used to rapidly determine the subtle differences and explore the potential chemical markers for differentiation within the herbs with similar chemical ingredients.	jujube pomonic acid
2	Stimulatory effects of extract prepared from the bark of Cinnamomum cassia blume on the function of osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells.The ethanol extract from the bark of Cinnamomum cassia Blume (CCE) was tested for estrogenic activity. CCE (4-60 microg/mL) significantly induced the growth of MCF-7 cells, an ER-positive human breast cancer cell line, over that of untreated control cells (p &lt; 0.05). In the ER competitive binding assay, CCE showed higher affinity with ERbeta compared with ERalpha. To investigate the bioactivities of CCE, which act on bone metabolism, the effects of CCE on the function of osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells and the production of local factors in osteoblasts were studied. CCE (4-60 microg/mL) dose-dependently increased the survival of MC3T3-E1 cells. In addition, CCE (10 and 50 microg/mL) increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, collagen synthesis and osteocalcin secretion in MC3T3-E1 cells. Treatment with CCE (10 and 50 microg/mL) prevented apoptosis induced by TNF-alpha (10(-10) m) in osteoblastic cells. In the presence of TNF-alpha, culture with CCE (10-100 microg/mL) for 48 h inhibited the production of IL-6 and nitric oxide in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. These results suggest that Cinnamomum cassia has a direct stimulatory effect on bone formation in vitro and may contribute to the prevention of osteoporosis and inflammatory bone diseases.	cinnamomum cassia bone diseases
2	Zanthoxylum usambarense (Engl.) Kokwaro (Rutaceae) extracts inhibit the growth of the breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, but not the brain tumour cell line U251 in vitro.Zanthoxylum usambarense (Engl.) Kokwaro has traditionally been used for the treatment of malaria, upper respiratory tract infections, cough, rheumatism, tooth decay and sore gums in Kenya and other African countries. Dried ground parts of Z. usambarense were extracted by maceration using methanol (MeOH) at room temperature, extract was dried and reconstituted in 70% aq. MeOH and partitioned against n-hexane and chloroform (CHCl3 ) to obtain MeOH, n-hexane and CHCl3 extracts. All extracts were assessed for cytotoxicity against two breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, and the brain tumour cell line U251 by the MTT assay. The free-radical scavenging activity of the extracts was also determined by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryhydrazyl (DPPH) assay. In the DPPH assay, the MeOH extract was found to be the most active free-radical scavenger with a RC50 value of 41.1 x 10(-3)  mg/mL. It also displayed significant cytotoxicity against the MCF-7 cell line (IC50 42.9 microg/mL) and appeared to have induced cell death through apoptosis. None of the test extracts showed any activity against the U251 cell line at test concentrations. The present findings demonstrated that Z. usambarense could be a potential source for new cytotoxic compounds for possible anticancer drug development.	z. usambarense respiratory tract infections
1	Rapid method using two microbial enzymes for detection of L-abrine in food as a marker for the toxic protein abrin.Abrin is a toxic protein produced by the ornamental plant Abrus precatorius, and it is of concern as a biothreat agent. The small coextracting molecule N-methyl-l-tryptophan (l-abrine) is specific to members of the genus Abrus and thus can be used as a marker for the presence or ingestion of abrin. Current methods for the detection of abrin or l-abrine in foods and other matrices require complex sample preparation and expensive instrumentation. To develop a fast and portable method for the detection of l-abrine in beverages and foods, the Escherichia coli proteins N-methyltryptophan oxidase (MTOX) and tryptophanase were expressed and purified. The two enzymes jointly degraded l-abrine to products that included ammonia and indole, and colorimetric assays for the detection of those analytes in beverage and food samples were evaluated. An indole assay using a modified version of Ehrlich's/Kovac's reagent was more sensitive and less subject to negative interferences from components in the samples than the Berthelot ammonia assay. The two enzymes were added into food and beverage samples spiked with l-abrine, and indole was detected as a degradation product, with the visual lower detection limit being 2.5 to 10.0 muM (~0.6 to 2.2 ppm) l-abrine in the samples tested. Results could be obtained in as little as 15 min. Sample preparation was limited to pH adjustment of some samples. Visual detection was found to be about as sensitive as detection with a spectrophotometer, especially in milk-based matrices. 	abrus precatorius indole
3	Trans-Cinnamic Acid Stimulates White Fat Browning and Activates Brown Adipocytes.Recently, pharmacological activation of brown fat and induction of white fat browning (beiging) have been considered promising strategies to treat obesity. To search for natural products that could stimulate the process of browning in adipocytes, we evaluated the activity of trans-cinnamic acid (tCA), a class of cinnamon from the bark of Cinnamomum cassia, by determining genetic expression using real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and protein expression by immunoblot analysis for thermogenic and fat metabolizing markers. In our study tCA induced brown like-phenotype in 3T3-L1 white adipocytes and activated HIB1B brown adipocytes. tCA increased protein content of brown-fat-specific markers (UCP1, PRDM16, and PGC-1alpha) and expression levels of beige-fat-specific genes (Cd137, Cidea, Cited1, Tbx1, and Tmen26) in 3T3-L1 white adipocytes, as well as brown-fat-specific genes (Lhx8, Ppargc1, Prdm16, Ucp1, and Zic1) in HIB1B brown adipocytes. Furthermore, tCA reduced expression of key adipogenic transcription factors C/EBPalpha and PPARgamma in white adipocytes, but enhanced their expressions in brown adipocytes. In addition, tCA upregulates lipid catabolism. Moreover, mechanistic study revealed that tCA induced browning in white adipocytes by activating the beta3-AR and AMPK signaling pathways. tCA can induce browning, increase fat oxidation, reduce adipogenesis and lipogenesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and activate HIB1B adipocytes, suggesting its potential to treat obesity.	tCA obesity
2	Phytotherapy against insomnia: extravagant claims or an alternative medicine?Insomnia or sleeplessness is a disorder characterized by a personal incapability to falling or staying asleep for a desirable period of time. Apart from Valeriana officinalis and Ziziphus jujuba most of the ethnobotanicals used for sleep disorders have not been evaluated for pharmacological or clinical efficacy against insomnia. Chinese herbal medicines involving polyherbal formulations are yet to be characterized and long-term side effects are yet to be evaluated. Anti insomniac phytotherapy opens up an exciting aspect of research which might benefit a large number of patients suffering from different degrees of insomnia.	ziziphus jujuba insomnia
1	Synergistic antioxidant activity of green tea with some herbs.Cardiovascular diseases, cancer, arthritis, etc. are caused by free radicals that are byproducts of metabolic pathways. Selected plants namely Vitis vinifera, Phyllanthus emblica L., Punica granatum, Cinnamomum cassia, Ginkgo biloba L., and Camellia sinensis Linn. are reported to produce antioxidant property. This study is undertaken to support the hypothesis that formulation of a polyherbal combination of these plants shows a synergistic effect with green tea. The extracts of each drug were characterized by phytochemical studies and tests for phenolics and flavonoids. In vitro antioxidant activity for individual drug and its combination was determined by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), superoxide, and nitric oxide free radical scavenging methods. Our results suggest that a combination of all these herbs with green tea can synergistically enhance antioxidant activity and thus lower doses of each herb with green tea may be used. Antioxidant potential of polyherbal combination was also comparable to that of standard ascorbic acid. Studies showed that selected individual plants contained abundant quantity of phenolics and flavonoids and their polyherbal combination with green tea was found to produce best antioxidant activity among all individual extracts. This will help in avoiding undesirable side effects due to higher doses of single herb.	vitis vinifera flavonoids
2	Repellency of aromatic medicinal plant extracts and a steam distillate to Aedes aegypti.The repellent activity of methanol extracts from 23 aromatic medicinal plant species and a steam distillate against female blood-starved Aedes aegypti was examined in the laboratory by skin test and compared with that of N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (deet). Responses varied according to plant species. At a dose of 0.1 mg/cm2, the repellency of extracts of Cinnamomum cassia bark (91%), Nardostachys chinensis rhizome (81%), Paeonia suffruticosa root bark (80%), and Cinnamomum camphora steam distillate (94%) was comparable to deet (82%). The duration of the effectiveness for extracts from C. cassia bark and N. chinensis rhizome was comparable to deet and lasted for approximately 1 h. Relatively short duration of repellency was observed in P. suffruticosa root bark extract and C. camphora steam distillate. The plants described merit further study as potential mosquito repellent agents.	n. chinensis mosquito repellent
1	Cinnamomum cassia Suppresses Caspase-9 through Stimulation of AKT1 in MCF-7 Cells but Not in MDA-MB-231 Cells.BACKGROUND: Cinnamomum cassia bark is a popular culinary spice used for flavoring and in traditional medicine. C. cassia extract (CE) induces apoptosis in many cell lines. In the present study, particular differences in the mechanism of the anti-proliferative property of C. cassia on two breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, were elucidated. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The hexane extract of C. cassia demonstrated high anti-proliferative activity against MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells (IC50, 34 +- 3.52 and 32.42 +- 0.37 mug/ml, respectively). Oxidative stress due to disruption of antioxidant enzyme (SOD, GPx and CAT) activity is suggested as the probable cause for apoptosis initiation. Though the main apoptosis pathway in both cell lines was found to be through caspase-8 activation, caspase-9 was also activated in MDA-MB-231 cells but suppressed in MCF-7 cells. Gene expression studies revealed that AKT1, the caspase-9 suppressor, was up-regulated in MCF-7 cells while down-regulated in MDA-MB-231 cells. Although, AKT1 protein expression in both cell lines was down-regulated, a steady increase in MCF-7 cells was observed after a sharp decrease of suppression of AKT1. Trans-cinnamaldehyde and coumarin were isolated and identified and found to be mainly responsible for the observed anti-proliferative activity of CE (Cinnamomum cassia). CONCLUSION: Activation of caspase-8 is reported for the first time to be involved as the main apoptosis pathway in breast cancer cell lines upon treatment with C. cassia. The double effects of C. cassia on AKT1 gene expression in MCF-7 cells is reported for the first time in this study.	c. cassia Trans-cinnamaldehyde
3	Cytotoxicity of benzophenanthridine alkaloids from the roots of Zanthoxylum nitidum (Roxb.) DC. var. fastuosum How ex Huang.This work aimed to investigate benzophenanthridine from the roots of Zanthoxylum nitidum (Roxb.) DC. var. fastuosum How ex Huang for the first time. Thirteen benzophenanthridines were isolated, and our results of the cytotoxic activities indicated that compound 6 exhibited the best potency against A549, Hela, SMMC-7721 and EJ, with the IC50 values of 27.50, 37.50, 16.95 and 60.42 muM, respectively. Compounds 7 and 11 also showed strong cytotoxicity when tested against the four human cancer cell lines (A549, Hela, SMMC-7721 and EJ), while only compounds 12 and 13 displayed cytotoxicity in inhibiting BALL-1 proliferation among all the compounds. These results suggested that benzophenanthridines may become a valid alternative of potential basis for new anti-proliferative agents.	benzophenanthridines cancer
4	Regulation of Caspase-3 and Bcl-2 Expression in Dalton's Lymphoma Ascites Cells by Abrin.The role of abrin, a toxic lectin isolated from seeds of Abrus precatorius Linn in inducing apoptosis in murine Dalton's Lymphoma Ascites (DLA) cells was evaluated. Abrin when incubated at the concentration of 10 ng per million DLA cells could bring about cell death as typical morphological changes with apoptosis. However, necrotic cell death dominated when a higher dose of abrin was used. DNA samples, isolated from DLA cells treated with abrin showed fragmentation. Abrin brought about induction of apoptosis by stimulating the expression of pro-apoptotic Caspase-3, at the same time blocking the expression of Bcl-2, which is an anti apoptotic gene. However, the expression of tumor suppressor gene p53 has not been observed in control and abrin-treated DLA cells. Results suggested that abrin effectively induced apoptotic changes in the tumor cells that led to cellular death.	p53 tumor
1	Repellency of Cinnamomum cassia bark compounds and cream containing cassia oil to Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) under laboratory and indoor conditions.Patch and skin bioassays were used in laboratory and indoor tests to evaluate the repellency of (E)-cinnamaldehyde, identified in Cinnamomum cassia Blume bark and essential oil, and a cream containing 5% (w/w) cassia oil against Aedes aegypti (L.) females. Results were compared with those of a known C. cassia compound cinnamyl alcohol, N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) and two commercial repellents: MeiMei cream containing citronella and geranium oils and Repellan S aerosol containing 19% DEET. In patch bioassay tests with A. aegypti females, (E)-cinnamaldehyde at 0.153 mg cm(-2) and DEET at 0.051 mg cm(-2) provided 93 and 89% protection at 40 min after exposure. In skin bioassay tests, (E)-cinnamaldehyde at 0.051 mg cm(-2) and DEET at 0.025 mg cm(-2) provided 87 and 95% protection at 30 min after application. (E)-Cinnamaldehyde was significantly more effective than cinnamyl alcohol in both bioassays. In indoor tests with four human volunteers, 5% cassia oil cream provided 94, 83 and 61% protection against A. aegypti females exposed for 30, 50 and 70 min after application respectively. Cassia oil cream was a slightly less effective repellent than MeiMei cream. Repellan S aerosol provided 91% repellency at 120 min after application. Products containing cassia oil merit further study as potential repellents for the protection of humans and domestic animals from blood-feeding vectors and the diseases they transmit.	c. cassia essential oil
2	Medicinal Plants Targeting Cardiovascular Diseases in View of Avicenna.BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a spectrum of diseases involving the heart and blood vessels, and the first cause of mortality worldwide. Medicinal plants have been used for thousands of years to treat CVD. In Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM), there is a special focus on heart diseases. Avicenna, a Persian physician of the eleventh century compiled a book devoted to this field named "The treatise on cardiac drugs" which is a compendium of TPM knowledge on CVD. Avicenna mentioned 50 cardiovascular active plants and described their therapeutic effects in the treatment of CVDs. METHODS: Here, we perform a detailed search in scientific databases to verify the cardiovascular activities of the medicinal plants suggested by Avicenna. Also, we discussed cardiovascular activities of a number of the most important suggested plants as well as their efficacy in clinical studies. Major bioactive compounds identified from these plants are also discussed. RESULTS: Pharmacological studies have revealed that the majority of these plants are effective in cardiovascular health with various mechanisms. Among them, Crocus sativus L., Cinnamomum cassia (L.) J. Presl, Punica granatum L., Ocimum basilicum L., Elettaria cardamomum (L.) Maton, Melissa officinalis L. and Phyllanthus emblica L. have proved to be more effective. CONCLUSION: The above-mentioned plants can be rich sources for developing new and effective pharmaceuticals for the treatment of CVDs.	melissa officinalis l cardiovascular disease
2	Anti-plasmodial activity and toxicity of extracts of plants used in traditional malaria therapy in Meru and Kilifi Districts of Kenya.The methanol and aqueous extracts of 10 plant species (Acacia nilotica, Azadirachta indica, Carissa edulis, Fagaropsis angolensis, Harrissonia abyssinica, Myrica salicifolia, Neoboutonia macrocalyx, Strychnos heningsii, Withania somnifera and Zanthoxylum usambarensis) used to treat malaria in Meru and Kilifi Districts, Kenya, were tested for brine shrimp lethality and in vitro anti-plasmodial activity against chloroquine-sensitive and chloroquine-resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum (NF54 and ENT30). Of the plants tested, 40% of the methanol extracts were toxic to the brine shrimp (LD(50)&lt;100micro/ml), while 50% showed in vitro anti-plasmodial activity (IC(50)&lt;100microg/ml). The methanol extract of the stem bark of N. macrocalyx had the highest toxicity to brine shrimp nauplii (LD(50) 21.04+/-1.8microg/ml). Methanol extracts of the rest of the plants exhibited mild or no brine shrimp toxicity (LD(50)&gt;50microg/ml). The aqueous extracts of N. macrocalyx had mild brine shrimp toxicity (LD(50) 41.69+/-0.9microg/ml), while the rest were lower (LD(50)&gt;100microg/ml). The methanol extracts of F. angolensis and Zanthoxylum usambarense had IC(50) values &lt;6microg/ml while the aqueous ones had values between 6 and 15microg/ml, against both chloroquine-sensitive and resistant P. falciparum strains. The results support the use of traditional herbs for anti-malarial therapy and demonstrate their potential as sources of drugs.	zanthoxylum usambarense toxicity
2	Effect of the herbal medicine dai-kenchu-to on gastrointestinal motility in patients with megacystis-microcolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIHS) and chronic idiopathic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIIP): report of two cases.Dai-kenchu-to (DKT), a traditional Japanese herbal medicine (Kampo medicine), composed of zanthoxylum fruit, ginseng root, dried ginger rhizome and malt sugar, is clinically effective for postoperative ileus and chronic constipation. MMIHS and CIIP are severe motility disorder associated with high morbidity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of DKT on functional intestinal obstruction. DKT was clinically effective for gastrointestinal motility in a case with MMIHS, but not effective in one with CIIP. MMIHS and CIIP are speculated to have different pathogenesis regarding gastrointestinal pseudo-obstruction based upon the effect of this drug.	ginseng constipation
1	Protective effects of cinnamic acid and cinnamic aldehyde on isoproterenol-induced acute myocardial ischemia in rats.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Cinnamomum cassia is a well-known traditional Chinese herb that is widely used for the treatment of ischemic heart disease (IHD). It has favorable effects, but its mechanism is not clear. To investigate the effects of cinnamic aldehyde (CA) and cinnamic acid (CD) isolated from Cinnamomum cassia against myocardial ischemia produced in rats by isoproterenol (ISO). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized equally to nine groups: a control group, an untreated model group, CA (22.5, 45, 90 mg/kg) or CD (37.5, 75, 150 mg/kg) treatment, or propranolol (30 mg/kg). Rats were treated for 14 days and then given ISO, 4 mg/kg for 2 consecutive days by subcutaneous injection. ST-segment elevation was measured after the last administration. Serum levels of creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), nitric oxide (NO), and blood rheology were measured after the rats were sacrificed. The hearts were excised for determining heart weight index, microscopic examination, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) measurements. RESULTS: CA and CD decreased the ST elevation induced by acute myocardial ischemia, decreased serum levels of CK-MB, LDH, TNF-alpha and IL-6, and increased serum NO activity. CA and CD increased SOD activity and decreased MDA content in myocardial tissue. CONCLUSION: CA and CD were cardioprotective in a rat model of ischemic myocardial injury. The protection was attributable to anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, as well as increased NO. The results support further study of CA and CD as potential treatments for ischemic heart disease.	cinnamomum cassia cinnamic aldehyde
2	Hormonal regulation of the basic peroxidase isoenzyme from Zinnia elegans.Xylem differentiation in plants is under strict hormonal regulation. Auxins and cytokinins, together with brassinosteroids (BRs), appear to be the main hormones controlling vascular differentiation. In this report, we study the effect of these hormones on the basic peroxidase isoenzyme from Zinnia elegans (ZePrx), an enzyme involved in lignin biosynthesis. Results showed that auxins and cytokinins induce ZePrx, similarly to the way in which they induce seedling secondary growth (in particular, metaxylem differentiation). Likewise, the exogenous application of BR reduces the levels of ZePrx, in a similar way to their capacity to inhibit seedling secondary growth. Consistent with this notion, the exogenous application of BR reverses the auxin/cytokinin-induced ZePrx expression, but has no effect on the auxin/cytokinin-induced secondary growth. This differential hormonal response is supported by the analysis of the ZePrx promoter, which contains (a) cis-elements directly responsive to these hormones and (b) cis-elements targets of the plethora of transcription factors, such as NAC, MYB, AP2, MADS and class III HD Zip, which are up-regulated during the auxin- and cytokinin-induced secondary growth. Taken together, these results suggest that ZePrx is directly and indirectly regulated by the plethora of hormones that control xylem differentiation, supporting the role of ZePrx in xylem lignification.	zinnia elegans lignin
1	Components and insecticidal activity against the maize weevils of Zanthoxylum schinifolium fruits and leaves.In our screening program for new agrochemicals from Chinese medicinal herbs and wild plants, Zanthoxylum schinifolium essential oils were found to possess strong insecticidal activity against the maize weevil Sitophilus zeamais. The essential oils of Z. schinifolium fruits and leaves were extracted via hydrodistillation and investigated by GC and GC-MS. Estragole (69.52%) was the major compound of the essential oil of fresh fruits, followed by linalool (8.63%) and limonene (4.34%) and 94.33% of the total components were monoterpenoids. The main components of the essential oil of fresh leaves were linalool (12.94%), ar-tumerone (8.95%), limonene (6.45%) and elixene (5.43%) and only 50.62% were monoterpenoids. However, the essential oil from purchased fruits contained linalool (33.42%), limonene (13.66%) and sabinene (5.72%), followed by estragole (4.67%), nerol (4.56%) and 4-terpineol (4.27%). Estragole, linalool and sabinene were separated and purified by silica gel column chromatography and preparative thin layer chromatography, and further identified by means of physicochemical and spectrometric analysis. The essential oil from the fresh fruits (LD50 = 15.93 mug/adult) possessed two times more toxicity to the insects compared with that of fresh leaves (LD50 = 35.31 mug/adult). Estragole, linalool and sabinene exhibited contact activity against S. zeamais with LD50 values of 17.63, 13.90 and 23.98 mug/adult, respectively. The essential oils of Z. schinifolium possessed strong fumigant toxicity against S. zeamais adults with LC50 values of 13.19 mg/L (fresh fruits), 24.04 mg/L (fresh leaves) and 17.63 mg/L (purchased fruits). Estragole, linalool and sabinene also exhibited strong fumigant toxicity against the maize weevils with LC50 values of 14.10, 10.46 and 9.12 mg/L, respectively.	maize weevils sabinene
2	An unusual manifestation of Abrus precatorius poisoning: a report of two cases.Abrus precatorius seeds are highly toxic and are often ingested as a means of suicide in India. Hemorrhagic gastroenteritis with erosions, hemolysis, acute renal damage, hepatotoxicity with elevated liver enzymes, and seizures are common manifestations of toxicity. We report two cases of Abrus precatorius poisoning with raised intracranial pressure (ICP) and papilledema that have not been described earlier in literature. One patient recovered completely with conservative management to lower raised ICP while the other patient expired before effective treatment could be institutedd. The cases are being reported to propose the need for routine fundus examination and brain imaging in severe abrus poisoning with CNS toxicity, as early institution of treatment for cerebral edema measures may be life saving.	abrus precatorius hemorrhagic gastroenteritis
2	Cinnamon in glycaemic control: Systematic review and meta analysis.BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Cinnamon seems to be highly bioactive, appearing to mimic the effect of insulin through increased glucose uptake in adipocytes and skeletal muscles. This systematic review and Meta analysis examined the effect of cinnamon on glycaemic control in patients with Type 2 Diabetes mellitus. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted from the earliest possible date through to 01 August 2011. Search terms included free text terms, MeSH and Medline medical index terms such as: "cinnamon", "cinnamomum", "cinnamomum cassia", "cinnamomum zeylanicum", "type 2 diabetes mellitus". Each was crossed with the term "diabetes mellitus". In addition, references of key articles were hand searched. RESULTS: A total of 6 clinical trials met the strict inclusion criteria and considered a total of 435 patients; follow up between 40 days-4 months, doses ranging from 1 g to 6 g per day. Meta-analysis of RCTs showed a significant decrease in mean HbA1c [0.09%; 95% CI was 0.04-0.14] and mean FPG [0.84 mmol/l; 95% CI was 0.66-1.02]. CONCLUSIONS: Use of cinnamon showed a beneficial effect on glycaemic control (both HbA1c and FPG) and the short term (&lt;4 months) effects of the use of cinnamon on glycaemic control looks promising.	cinnamon diabetes mellitus
1	Possible attenuation of nitric oxide expression in anti-inflammatory effect of Ziziphus jujuba in rat.The hydroalcoholic extract of fruits of Ziziphus jujuba (ZJ) was investigated for its anti-inflammatory effect using acute and chronic models of inflammation in rat. Wistar albino rats of either sex were employed in the present study (n = 6). Acute inflammation was induced by subplantar administration of carrageenan (1%) in rat hind paw. Chronic inflammation was induced by interscapular implantation of a sterile cotton pellet (50 mg). ZJ extract as test drug and indomethacin (10 mg/kg) as standard were used. Serum nitrite/nitrate was also estimated to determine the expression of nitric oxide. In the acute study, carrageenan (1%) administration caused marked paw edema. Pretreatment with ZJ extract exhibited marked dose-dependent attenuation in edema compared to control. In the chronic study, interscapular implantation of sterile cotton pellets caused significant granuloma formation after 7 days, serving as control. ZJ extract significantly decreased granuloma tissue formation compared to control. The serum nitrite/nitrate level was significantly increased after 7 days in the control group due to chronic inflammation, but was decreased by ZJ extract. Moreover, phytochemical studies indicated the presence of jujubosides, flavonoids and terpenes, which may produce the marked anti-inflammatory effect of ZJ fruit in acute and chronic inflammation, possibly by inhibiting nitric oxide expression. The study provides a scientific and ethnopharmacological rationale for the therapeutic use of ZJ fruit as an anti-inflammatory agent.	ziziphus jujuba jujubosides
1	Schistosomicidal evaluation of Zanthoxylum naranjillo and its isolated compounds against Schistosoma mansoni adult worms.Chemical investigation of the EtOAc fraction (EF) obtained from the ethanolic extract of Zanthoxylum naranjillo (Rutaceae) leaves (EE) by preparative HPLC resulted in the isolation of protocatechuic acid (1), gallic acid (2), p-hydroxybenzoic acid (3), and 5-O-caffeoylshikimic acid (4). This is the first time that the presence of compounds 1-4 in Z. naranjillo has been reported. Compounds 1-4, the EE, and EF were tested in vitro against Schistosoma mansoni adult worms. The results showed that the S. mansoni daily egg production decreased by 29.8%, 13.5%, 28.4%, 17.7%, 16.3%, and 6.4%, respectively. Compounds 1 and 3 were also able to separate adult worm pairs into male and female. This activity may be correlated with the reduction in egg production, since 1 and 3 showed better inhibitory properties compared with 2 and 4.	zanthoxylum naranjillo 5-o-caffeoylshikimic acid
2	Repellency of aromatic medicinal plant extracts and a steam distillate to Aedes aegypti.The repellent activity of methanol extracts from 23 aromatic medicinal plant species and a steam distillate against female blood-starved Aedes aegypti was examined in the laboratory by skin test and compared with that of N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (deet). Responses varied according to plant species. At a dose of 0.1 mg/cm2, the repellency of extracts of Cinnamomum cassia bark (91%), Nardostachys chinensis rhizome (81%), Paeonia suffruticosa root bark (80%), and Cinnamomum camphora steam distillate (94%) was comparable to deet (82%). The duration of the effectiveness for extracts from C. cassia bark and N. chinensis rhizome was comparable to deet and lasted for approximately 1 h. Relatively short duration of repellency was observed in P. suffruticosa root bark extract and C. camphora steam distillate. The plants described merit further study as potential mosquito repellent agents.	aedes aegypti mosquito repellent
2	Cinnamomum cassia ameliorates Ni-NPs-induced liver and kidney damage in male Sprague Dawley rats.Nickel nanoparticles (Ni-NPs) have been widely used in various industries related to electronics, ceramics, textiles, and nanomedicine. Ambient and occupational exposure to Ni-NPs may bring about potential detrimental effects on animals and humans. Thus, there is a growing effort to identify compounds that can ameliorate NPs-associated pathophysiologies. The present study examined Cinnamomum cassia (C. cassia) bark extracts (CMBE) for its ameliorative activity against Ni-NPs-induced pathophysiological and histopathological alterations in male Sprague Dawley rats. The biochemical analyses revealed that dosing rats with Ni-NPs at 10 mg/kg/body weight (b.w.) significantly altered the normal structural and biochemical adaptations in the liver and kidney. Conversely, supplementations with CMBE at different doses (225, 200, and 175 mg/kg/b.w. of rat) ameliorated the altered blood biochemistry and reduced the biomarkers of liver and kidney function considerably (p < 0.05) in a dose-dependent manner. However, the best results were at 225 mg/kg/b.w. of rat. The study provided preliminary information about the protective effect of C. cassia against Ni-NPs indicated liver and kidney damages. Future investigations are needed to explore C. cassia mechanism of action of C. cassia and isolation of single constituents of C. cassia to assess their pharmaceutical importance accordingly.	c. cassia liver and kidney damage

Their structures and configurations were elucidated by spectroscopic methods and X-ray analysis. Compounds 1, 4, and 5 showed in vitro antiviral effect against hepatitis B virus, and compounds 2, 3, and 5 demonstrated marked antimitotic and antifungal activity.	zanthoxylum nitidum skimmianine
2	Glucose lowering and pancreato-protective effects of Abrus Precatorius (L.) leaf extract in normoglycemic and STZ/Nicotinamide - Induced diabetic rats.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Abrus precatorius (L.) leaves are used as folk medicine by the local communities in the western region of Ghana to treat diabetes mellitus; however, this health claim remains unverified scientifically. OBJECTIVE: The study investigated glucose lowering and pancreato-protective effects of Abrus precatorius leaf extract (APLE) in normoglycemic and STZ/nicotinamide (NIC)-induced diabetic rats. METHOD: after preparation of APLE, it was subjected to phytochemical screening, proximate composition and elemental assessments by using standard methods. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and maltose, lactose and sucrose oral challenge were assessed in normoglycemic rats post-APLE. Morphological characteristics of glucose response curve (time of glucose peak and shape of glucose response curve) were determined. Subsequently, diabetes mellitus was experimentally established in normoglycaemic adult Sprague-Dawley rats (weighing 150-250 g) of both sexes by sequential injection of Streptozotocin (STZ, 60 mg/kg ip)-reconstituted in sodium citrate buffer and NIC (110 mg/kg ip)-reconstituted in normal saline (1:1 v/v) for 16 weeks. Except control rats (normal saline 5 ml/kg ip; baseline fasting blood glucose [FBG] of 6.48 mmol/L), rats having FBG (stable at 11.1 mmol/L or >= 250 mg/dL) 3 days post-STZ/NIC injection were randomly re-assigned to one of the following groups: model (STZ/NIC-induced diabetic rats), APLE (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg respectively po) and metformin (300 mg/kg po) and treated daily for 28 days. Bodyweight and FBG were measured on weekly basis. FBG was measured by using standard glucometers. On day 28, rats were sacrificed under chloroform anesthesia, blood collected via cardiac puncture; kidney, liver and pancreas surgically harvested. While the pancreas was processed, sectioned and H&E-stained for histological examination, fresh kidney and liver were homogenized for assessment of total anti-oxidant capacity. Median cross-sectional area of pancreatic islets of Langerhans was determined for each group by using Amscope. RESULTS: Cumulatively, APLE (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg respectively) dose-dependently decreased the initial FBG by 55.22, 76.15 and 77.77% respectively compared to model (-1.04%) and metformin (72.29%) groups. APLE treatment recovered damaged pancreatic beta-cells and also increased median cross-sectional area (x106 mum2) of pancreatic islets compared to that of model group. APLE significantly (P < 0.05) increased total anti-oxidant capacity (5.21 +- 0.02 AscAE mug/mL) of plasma, kidney and liver compared to model (4.06 +- 0.04 AscAE mug/mL) and metformin (4.87 +- 0.03 AscAE mug/mL) groups. CONCLUSION: APLE has demonstrated glucose lowering and pancreato-protective effects in rats and arrested the characteristic loss in bodyweight associated with diabetes mellitus. This finding preliminarily confirms folk use of APLE as an anti-diabetic herbal medicine, whiles providing a rationale for further translational studies on APLE.	abrus precatorius diabetic
2	Cinnamomum cassia extract promotes thermogenesis during exposure to cold via activation of brown adipose tissue.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Cinnamomum cassia (L.) J.Presl (Lauraceae), a widely used traditional Chinese medicine, is well known to exert hot property. It is recorded as dispelling cold drug in ancient Chinese monographs, such as Synopsis of golden chamber published in Han dynasty. According to Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2015), Cinnamomum cassia (L.) J.Presl (Cinnamon) has the functions of dispersing cold, relieving pain, warming meridians and promoting blood circulation. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of Cinnamon extract (CE) on cold endurance and the mechanism of thermogenesis activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The improving effect of hypothermia were evaluated with body temperature by infrared camera and multi-thermo thermometer. In vivo, the thermogenic effect was observed with energy metabolism and substrate utilization. The activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) was evaluated with the histomorphology and expression of thermogenic protein. In vitro, the uncoupling effects on mitochondrial was evaluated with Seahorse and fluorescent staining. The mechanism of thermogenesis was explored in brown adipocyte. RESULTS: The body temperature and energy expenditure were significantly increased by CE administration in cold environment. In morphology, lipid droplets were reduced and the number of mitochondrial was increased. CE significantly increased the non-shivering thermogenesis via upregulating the expression of thermogenic protein. In vitro, the uncoupling effect was obviously along with the decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production. It was confirmed that the thermogenesis effect was induced via lipolysis and energy metabolism. In addition, CE also alleviated myocardium injury in the morphology in cold environment. Moreover, the major constituent was identified as (1) coumarin, (2) cinnamic acid, (3) cinnamaldehyde and (4) 2-methoxy cinnamaldehyde. CONCLUSIONS: The mechanism of improving cold tolerance was related to lipolysis and activation of BAT. Meanwhile, we provided a kind of potential prevention methods for cold injury.	cinnamomum cassia cold injury
3	An efficient and stereoselective dearylation of asarinin and sesamin tetrahydrofurofuran lignans to acuminatolide by methyltrioxorhenium/H(2)O(2) and UHP systems.The synthesis of stereoisomers of acuminatolide is rare and requires complex and time-consuming multistep procedures. Asarinin (1) and sesamin (2), two diasteromeric tetrahydrofurofuran lignans, are efficiently mono-dearylated by methyltrioxorhenium (MTO, I) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or urea hydrogen peroxide adduct (UHP) as primary oxidant to give (-)-(7R,8'R,8R)-acuminatolide (3A) and (+)-(7S,8R,8'R)-acuminatolide (3B), respectively, in high yield and diastereoselectivity (de &gt;98%). The oxidation of 1 was also performed with novel heterogeneous catalysts based on the heterogenation of MTO on poly(4-vinylpyridine) and polystyrene resins. In these latter cases 3A was obtained with a different yield and selectivity depending on the physical-chemical properties of the support. Cytotoxic effects of 3A and 3B in mammalian cell lines in vitro are also reported.	acuminatolide Cytotoxic
1	Chemical Composition of Essential Oils from Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim. and Their Bioactivities against Lasioderma serricorne.Two essential oil samples were obtained from the pericarp of Zanthoxylum bungeanum with the methods of hydrodistillation (HD) and supercritical fluid CO2 extraction (SFE), their chemical components were identified, and their bioactivities against Lasioderma serricorne adults were evaluated. In the process of testing, the two samples showed significant bioactivities against Lasioderma serricorne adults. For an example, the SFE-sample expressed relatively stronger fumigant toxicity on Lasioderma serricorne adults (LC50 = 3.99 mug/mL air) than that of the HD-sample (LC50 = 12.54 mug/mL air). According to GC-MS analysis, the chemical components between two samples were different. The major chemical components for HD included linalool (25.99%), limonene (19.34%), linalyl anthranilate (12.22%), 4-terpinenol (10.49%), eucalyptol (6.53%) and alpha-terpineol (5.02%), while for SFE included nonanoic acid (21.43%), gamma-terpinene (14.51%), eucalyptol (13.45%), alpha-terpineol (5.83%) and caryophyllene oxide (5.48%). The results showed that different chemical components result in different bioactivities. This work provides theoretical basis for traditional Chinese concept of antagonistic storage, and it also provides important information for the development and comprehensive utilization of Zanthoxylum bungeanum.	zanthoxylum bungeanum essential oil
4	2-Methoxycinnamaldehyde inhibits the TNF-alpha-induced proliferation and migration of human aortic smooth muscle cells.The abnormal proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is a crucial event in the development of atherosclerosis, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is actively involved in this process by enhancing the proliferation and migration of VSMCs. 2-Methoxycinnamaldehyde (MCA) is a natural compound of Cinnamomum cassia. Although 2-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (HCA), another compound from Cinnamomum cassia, has been widely studied with regard to its antitumor activity, MCA has not attracted researchers' interest due to its mild toxic effects on cancer cells and its mechanisms of action remain unknown. In this study, we examined the effects of MCA on the TNF-alpha-induced proliferation and migration of human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). As shown by our results, MCA inhibited TNF-alpha-induced cell proliferation by reducing the levels of cyclin D1, cyclin D3, CDK4 and CDK6, and increasing the levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p21 and p27, without resulting in cellular cytotoxicity. Furthermore, MCA decreased the level of secreted matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 by inhibiting MMP-9 transcription. Unexpectedly, MCA did not affect the TNF-alpha-induced levels of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). However, by showing that MCA potently inhibited the degradation of IkappaBalpha and the subsequent nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), we demonstrated that MCA exerts its effects through the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. MCA also effectively inhibited platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced HASMC migration. Taken together, these observations suggest that MCA has the potential for use as an anti-atherosclerotic agent.	NF-kappaB atherosclerotic
2	A standardized extract of the fruit of Ziziphus jujuba (Jujube) induces neuronal differentiation of cultured PC12 cells: a signaling mediated by protein kinase A.The fruit of Ziziphus jujuba Mill., known as Chinese date or jujube, is consumed as a health supplement worldwide. To study the role of jujube in brain benefits, its effects on neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells were studied. Application of jujube water extract induced neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells, &gt;25% of which were differentiated; this effect was similar to that of nerve growth factor. In parallel, the expressions of neurofilaments (NFs) in jujube-treated cultures showed a dose-dependent increase, with the highest inductions by ~150% for NF68 and NF160 and by ~100% for NF200. Application of H89, a protein kinase A inhibitor, attenuated jujube-induced neurite outgrowth of the cultures. Besides, using jujube extract induced the phosphorylation of cAMP responsive element binding protein on PC12 cells, which was blocked by H89. These results support the use of jujube as a food supplement for the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases in which neurotrophin deficiency is involved. 	jujube neurodegenerative diseases
2	Hydroalcoholic extract from Abelmoschus manihot (Linn.) Medicus flower reverses sleep deprivation-evoked learning and memory deficit.Previous researches have indicated that sleep plays a vital role in cognitive functions. Sleep deprivation (SD) causes learning and memory damage, which is associated with oxidative stress. This study was performed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of an extract of Abelmoschus manihot flower (EAM) against memory deficit induced by SD in mice. The SD model was evoked by multiple platform method for 5 days, successively. The learning and memory-improving effects of EAM were assessed by behavioral trials and the underlying mechanism was investigated by measuring the oxidative stress alteration. Our findings indicated that the SD-induced memory deficit and the EAM treatment improved the cognitive functions of mice in the object location recognition test and passive avoidance task. In addition, EAM effectively improved the activities of the antioxidant enzyme, decreased the content of malondialdehyde (MDA), and restored the protein expression of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), tyrosine kinase B (TrkB) and glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1) in brain tissues. In conclusion, EAM could improve the SD-evoked learning and memory impairments. The possible underlying mechanisms of EAM may be related to its antioxidant capacity and enhanced BDNF/TrkB/GluR1 levels in the hippocampal memory.	abelmoschus manihot learning and memory impairments
4	Abrus Agglutinin, a type II ribosome inactivating protein inhibits Akt/PH domain to induce endoplasmic reticulum stress mediated autophagy-dependent cell death.Abrus agglutinin (AGG), a type II ribosome-inactivating protein has been found to induce mitochondrial apoptosis. In the present study, we documented that AGG-mediated Akt dephosphorylation led to ER stress resulting the induction of autophagy-dependent cell death through the canonical pathway in cervical cancer cells. Inhibition of autophagic death with 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and siRNA of Beclin-1 and ATG5 increased AGG-induced apoptosis. Further, inhibiting apoptosis by Z-DEVD-FMK and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) increased autophagic cell death after AGG treatment, suggesting that AGG simultaneously induced autophagic and apoptotic death in HeLa cells. Additionally, it observed that AGG-induced autophagic cell death in Bax knock down (Bax-KD) and 5-FU resistant HeLa cells, confirming as an alternate cell killing pathway to apoptosis. At the molecular level, AGG-induced ER stress in PERK dependent pathway and inhibition of ER stress by salubrinal, eIF2alpha phosphatase inhibitor as well as siPERK reduced autophagic death in the presence of AGG. Further, our in silico and colocalization study showed that AGG interacted with pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Akt to suppress its phosphorylation and consequent downstream mTOR dephosphorylation in HeLa cells. We showed that Akt overexpression could not augment GRP78 expression and reduced autophagic cell death by AGG as compared to pcDNA control, indicating Akt modulation was the upstream signal during AGG's ER stress mediated autophagic cell death. In conclusion, we established that AGG stimulated cell death by autophagy might be used as an alternative tumor suppressor mechanism in human cervical cancer.   2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	mTOR cancer
2	Protection against cyclophosphamide-induced myelosuppression by ZPDC glycoprotein (24 kDa).Immunomodulatory agents are often used to reduce myelosuppression and enhance immune response for cancer treatment. Cyclophosphamide (CTX) can induce oxidative stress in bone marrow resulting in suppression of anti-oxdiantive enzymes and causes myelosuppression. We isolated glycoprotein from Zanthoxylum piperitum DC fruit (ZPDC), and it consists of a carbohydrate (18%) and a protein (82%). The objective of this study was to investigate its protective activity against CTX-induced myelosuppression in Balb/c (n=6/group). The mice were orally administrated by ZPDC glycoprotein (10 and 20 mg/kg, BW) for 1 week in the presence or absence of CTX. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), anti-oxidant enzymes [superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and catalase (CAT)], cyclin kinase inhibitors (CKIs: p53, p21 and p27), cyclin D1/ cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) 4, PCNA and cytokines [interleukin (IL)-3, and granulocyte/ macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)] were evaluated using biochemical activity, Western blot analysis, and ELISA. The results obtained from this study showed that CTX decreased spleen and thymic indices, bone marrow cellularity and expression of cyclin D1/CDK4 and PCNA, but it increased CKIs, whereas ZPDC glycoprotein (20 mg/kg, BW) resulted in vice versa in CTX-induced Balb/c. Expression of IL-3 and GM-CSF were normalized by ZPDC glycoprotein. Thus, this study suggested that ZPDC glycoprotein prevents oxidative stress and myelosuppression in CTX-induced mice and might be a potential immunomodulatory agent.	zanthoxylum piperitum myelosuppression

Chinese traditional medicine Cinnamomum cassia Presl has been shown to have significant tumor-killing effect, in which cinnamaldehyde (CA) is the main active ingredient. Purpose: To explore the anticancer effect of CA on the osteosarcoma cells and the possible molecular mechanism. Methods: Crystal violet assay, MTT assay and colony-forming assay were used to confirm the inhibitory role of CA in the proliferation of 143B and MG63 osteosarcoma cells. Hoechst 33258 staining and flow cytometry were used to observe apoptosis. The migration and invasion role of OS cells were evaluated using transwell assays and wound healing assays. Western blotting was used to analyse the protein expression levels. Nude mice were inoculated with 143B cells to establish an orthotopic OS tumor animal model and to investigate the effects of CA on OS tumors. Results: According to crystal violet assay, MTT assay and colony-forming assay, CA significantly inhibited cell proliferation. Hoechst 33258 staining and flow cytometry analysis showed that CA-induced apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, transwell assays and wound healing assays showed that CA inhibited the migration and invasion of osteosarcoma cells. In vivo mouse models, CA inhibited the growth of osteosarcoma. The potential mechanisms could be that CA inhibited the transcriptional activity of Wnt/beta-catenin and PI3K/Akt of the osteosarcoma. Conclusion: CA may inhibit the proliferation, migration, invasion and promote apoptosis of OS cells by inhibiting Wnt/beta-catenin and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. CA may be a potentially effective anti-tumor drug.	Cinnamaldehyde beta-catenin
0	Inhibition of STAT3 signaling pathway by nitidine chloride suppressed the angiogenesis and growth of human gastric cancer.STAT3 has been strongly implicated in human malignancies, and constitutive activation of STAT3 serves a crucial role in cell survival, angiogenesis, immune evasion, and inflammation. In this study, we showed that nitidine chloride, a natural phytochemical alkaloid derived from Zanthoxylum nitidum (Roxb) DC, exerts potent anticancer activity through STAT3 signaling cascade. Nitidine chloride dose dependently suppressed VEGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tubular structure formation in vitro and dramatically reduced VEGF-triggered neovascularization in mouse cornea and Matrigel plugs in vivo. This angiogenesis inhibition mediated by nitidine chloride was well interpreted by the suppression of Janus kinase 2/STAT3 signaling and STAT3 DNA-binding activity in endothelial cells. Furthermore, nitidine chloride suppressed the constitutively activated STAT3 protein, its DNA-binding activity, and the expression of STAT3-dependent target genes, including cyclin D1, Bcl-xL, and VEGF in human gastric cancer cells. Consistent with the earlier findings, nitidine chloride inhibited gastric tumor cell growth and induced tumor cell apoptosis in vitro and effectively suppressed the volume, weight, and microvessel density of human SGC-7901 gastric solid tumors (n = 8) at a dosage of 7 mg/kg/d (intraperitoneal injection). Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis further revealed that the expression of STAT3, CD31, and VEGF protein in xenografts was remarkably decreased by the alkaloid. Taken together, we propose that nitidine chloride is a promising anticancer drug candidate as a potent STAT3 signaling inhibitor.	nitidine chloride STAT3
3	New polyunsaturated fatty acid amides isolated from the seeds of Zanthoxylum piperitum.Five linear fatty acid amides (1-5) of the sandshool class, including two new compounds, were isolated from Zanthoxylum piperitum seeds. Based on combined spectral analyses, the structures of new compounds 4 and 5 were determined to be 2',3'-dihydroxy-alpha-sanshool and 2',3'-dihydroxy-beta-sanshool, respectively. These compounds exhibited weak cytotoxicity in the A-549 (human lung cancer) cell line.	2',3'-dihydroxy-beta-sanshool lung cancer
3	Acute demyelinating encephalitis after jequirity pea ingestion (Abrus precatorius).INTRODUCTION: Castor and jequirity beans are uncommon causes of poisoning. The more common but less severe castor poisoning is well described, but jequirity bean (Abrus Precatorius) poisoning is rare. The toxicity is attributed to toxalbumins (ricin and abrin) that act by inhibiting protein synthesis. Their use as agents of biological warfare, mechanisms of action, and clinical features of poisoning are summarized. CASE REPORT: A 30-year-old previously healthy female presented with bloody diarrhea and deep coma following ingestion of 3-4 seeds of a plant called 'ratti.' Investigations, including an MRI brain scan, showed evidence of acute demyelinating encephalitis. The patient died three days later due to progressive central nervous system depression. DISCUSSION: This is a previously unreported manifestation of jequirity bean poisoning. Demyelination is immune-mediated, and Abrus is a well-known immuno-modulator and stimulator. A possible immunological pathogenic mechanism is hypothesized.	toxalbumins toxicity
0	Cinnamaldehyde induces apoptosis and reverses epithelial-mesenchymal transition through inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in non-small cell lung cancer.Cinnamaldehyde, the main chemical component of the essential oil separated from the traditional herb Cinnamomum cassia, has been demonstrated to be an efficient cytotoxic agent against several human cancers. The present experiment showed that cinnamaldehyde dose-dependently depresses the proliferation of three types of NSCLC cells and induces cell apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, cinnamaldehyde attenuated CoCl2-induced EMT and decreased matrix metalloprotease (MMP) family while the in vivo study showed the same trend. Mechanistically, cinnamaldehyde imitated the suppressive effect of XAV939 on cell motility and EMT which could be impaired by LiCl. Collectively, our research demonstrated for the first time that cinnamaldehyde is able to inhibit NSCLC cell growth by inducing apoptosis and reverse EMT through terminating Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, which might supply further insight into cinnamaldehyde-mediated anti-tumor effect against NSCLC for better prognosis.	cinnamaldehyde beta-catenin
3	In vitro immunostimulatory properties of Abrus lectins derived peptides in tumor bearing mice.In vitro immunostimulatory effect of Abrus lectins derived peptide fractions (AGP and ABP) was investigated in DL bearing mice. Both AGP and ABP were found to activate splenocytes and induced production of cytokines like IL-2, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha indicating a Th1 type of immune response. Analysis of in vitro treated splenocytes by flow cytometry revealed an increase in percentage of T and B cell with high expression of activation markers (CD25(+) and CD71(+)). At the same time, expression of co-stimulatory markers was significantly high compared to tumor control. The tumor associated macrophages were able to stimulate NO production, IL-1 secretion, increased phagocytosis and decreased expression of mannose receptor. It was also observed that NK cell was activated by AGP and ABP. These results suggest that both AGP and ABP act as immunostimulants in vitro in DL bearing mice.	abrus lectins tumor
1	In vitro activities of plant extracts on human Loa loa isolates and cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells.Loa loa, a filarial worm, can cause fatal encephalitis in humans. In an attempt to find alternatives to the standard treatments (ivermectin and diethylcarbamazine citrate), we tested 12 methanolic extracts of nine traditional plant remedies. The extracts (100-0.09 microg/ml) were incubated with 20 Loa loa microfilariae isolated from patients at 37 degrees C with 5% CO(2) in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal serum and antibiotics. Activity was evaluated 120 h later by counting live microfilariae under a microscope. Cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells was estimated by measuring 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2-5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide transformation to formazan at 450 nM in a spectrophotometer. The plants tested were Lophira alata, Greenwayodendron suaveolens, Uapaca togoensis, Zanthoxylum heitzii, Peperomia pellucida, Piptadeniastrum africanum, Petersianthus macrocarpus, Vernonia conferta, and Vernonia hymenolepis. Chemical screening showed that most of the extracts contained reducing sugars, tannin or polyphenols, sterols or triterpenes, saponosides, and alkaloids. None contained carotinoids and few contained flavonoids. The 50% lethal concentration ranged from 0.22 to 70.28 microg/ml, while the 50% inhibitory concentration for eukaryotic cells (IC(50)) ranged from 8.52 to 119.52 microg/ml. Extracts of P. macrocarpus (selectivity index = 72.16), P. africanum (13.69), Z. heitzii (12.11), and L. alata (9.26) were highly selective for L. loa.	p. macrocarpus sugars
1	Constituents of the essential oil of the Cinnamomum cassia stem bark and the biological properties.GC-MS analysis on the essential oil (CC-oil) of Cinnamomum cassia stem bark led to the identification of cinnamaldehyde (CNA, 1), 2-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (2-CNA), coumarin (2), and cinnamyl acetate. The major volatile flavor in CC-oil was found to be 2-CNA. Coumarin was first isolated from this plant by phytochemical isolation and spectroscopic analysis. CNA and CC-oil showed potent cytotoxicity, which was effectively prevented by N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) treatment. Intraperitoneal administration with CNA considerably decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) formation and glutathione S-transferase activity in rats. These results suggest that CC-oil and CNA can regulate the triggering of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes by the formation of a glutathione-conjugate.	cinnamomum cassia cinnamyl acetate
1	Fatal abrin poisoning by injection.Abrin is a toxin of public health concern due to its lethality, lack of antidote, and potential for use as a bioterrorism agent. Possible routes of exposure include ingestion, inhalation, and injection. Onset of symptoms is often delayed, even in severe cases. In fatal cases, death occurs from multi-organ failure. We describe the clinical course, laboratory, and pathologic findings in a case of fatal human poisoning associated with abrin injection. The Abrus precatorius seeds in this case were obtained via the internet. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Laboratory Response Network detected abrine in the urine confirming abrin exposure in this fatal poisoning.	abrus precatorius abrine
4	Abrus Agglutinin, a type II ribosome inactivating protein inhibits Akt/PH domain to induce endoplasmic reticulum stress mediated autophagy-dependent cell death.Abrus agglutinin (AGG), a type II ribosome-inactivating protein has been found to induce mitochondrial apoptosis. In the present study, we documented that AGG-mediated Akt dephosphorylation led to ER stress resulting the induction of autophagy-dependent cell death through the canonical pathway in cervical cancer cells. Inhibition of autophagic death with 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and siRNA of Beclin-1 and ATG5 increased AGG-induced apoptosis.

We showed that Akt overexpression could not augment GRP78 expression and reduced autophagic cell death by AGG as compared to pcDNA control, indicating Akt modulation was the upstream signal during AGG's ER stress mediated autophagic cell death. In conclusion, we established that AGG stimulated cell death by autophagy might be used as an alternative tumor suppressor mechanism in human cervical cancer.   2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

1	[Ovicidal activity of nine essential oils against Chrysomya megacephara in bacon and kipper].To exploit safe ovicides against the flies that attack bacon and kipper, the ovicidal activity of 9 plant essential oils was investigated by a modified egg-dipping method. The results indicated that the essential oils from Cinnamomun cassia, Eugenia caryophyllata and Illicum verum had higher ovicidal activity, with their LC50 values being 0.428, 1.605 and 2.489 mg x ml(-1), respectively. Through GC/MS analysis, a total of 22 components were identified from C. cassia oil, among which, cinamaldehyde was the most predominant one, accounting for 92.33% of the total. The LC50 of synthesized cinamaldehyde (97.33%) was 0.281 mg x ml(-1), being a little higher than the LC50 of C. cassia oil, suggesting that cinamaldehyde was the main ovicidal component of C. cassia oil and could replace the latter as an ovicide against harmful flies.	c. cassia essential oils
2	Topical antiinflammatory activity of the major lipophilic constituents of the rhizome of Zingiber cassumunar. Part II: Hexane extractives.A hexane extract of the rhizome of Zingiber cassumunar was found to exhibit topical antiinflammatory activity, when tested in the model of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced ear edema in rats (ID(50) = 854 mug/ear). Bioassay-guided fractionation (by MPLC on silica gel) of the hexane extract led to the isolation and identification of (E)-4-(3',4'-dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-enyl acetate (1), cis-3-(3',4'-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-[(E)-3,''',4'''- dimethoxystyryl]cyclohex-l-ene (2), cis-3-(3',4'-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-[(E)-2''',4''',5'''- trimethoxystyryl]cyclohex-1-ene (3), cis-3-(2',4',5'-trimethoxyphenyl)-4-[(E)-2''',4''',5'''- trimethoxystyryl]cyclohex-l-ene (4) and (E)-4-(3'-4'-dime-thoxyphenyl)but-3-en-l-ol (5). Compounds 1-5 exerted potent topical antiinflammatory activities with ID(50)-values of 62, 21, 20, 2 and 47mug/ear, respectively. The ID(50) of the reference drug diclofenac was determined to be 61 mug/ear.	zingiber cassumunar ear edema
1	Abrus precatorius Leaves: Antioxidant Activity in Food and Biological Systems, pH, and Temperature Stability.Natural antioxidants present in foods and other biological materials have attracted considerable interest because of their presumed safety and potential nutritional and therapeutic effects. Antioxidant constituents of plant materials act as radical scavengers and convert the radicals to less reactive species. Abrus precatorius (AP) was analyzed for its proximate and phytochemical composition. The leaves were extracted with methanol (ME) and analyzed for antioxidant activity by radical scavenging method, reducing power, ferric reducing capacity, and in vitro inhibition of Fenton's reagent-induced oxidation in oil emulsion and microsomes. In addition, the effect of temperature (100 C, 15, and 30 min) and pH (4.5, 7, and 9) C on the antioxidant activity of ME was investigated. The leaves were rich in total polyphenols, flavonoids, beta-carotene, glutathione, alpha-tocopherol, and ascorbic acid. The ME exhibited varying degree of antioxidant activity in a dose-dependent manner. The AP exhibited more inhibition of oxidation in microsomes (73%) than compared to oil emulsion (21%). Heat treatment resulted in an increase of radical scavenging activity of extract (28% to 43%). At pH 4.5 the extract exhibited more antioxidant activity and stability compared to pH 7 and 9. Data indicates that potential exists for the utilization of Abrus precatorius as a natural antioxidant. 	abrus precatorius polyphenols
2	Zanthoxylum piperitum reversed alveolar bone loss of periodontitis via regulation of bone remodeling-related factors.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Zanthoxylum piperitum (ZP) has been used to prevent toothache in East Asia. AIM OF STUDY: In this study, we investigated the effects of ZP on periodontitis along with alveolar bone loss. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned into 4 groups; non-ligated (NOR), ligated and treated vehicle (CTR), ligated and treated 1mg/mL ZP (ZP1), and ligated and treated 100mg/mL ZP (ZP100). Sterilized 3-0 nylon ligature was placed into the subgingival sulcus around the both sides of mandibular first molar. After topical application of 1 and 100mg/mL ZP for 2 weeks, mandibles was removed for histology. In addition, SaOS-2 osteoblast cells were treated 1, 10 and 100mug/mL ZP for 24h to analyze the expressions of alveolar bone-related markers. RESULTS: Several alveolar bone resorption pits, which indicate cementum demineralization were decreased by ZP treatment. Topical ZP treatment inhibited periodontitis-induced alveolar bone loss. In addition, there were significant reduction of osteoclastic activities following topical ZP treatment in periodontium. The expression of RANKL was decreased in SaOS-2 osteoblast cells by treating ZP, while that of OPG was increased. ZP treatment increased the expressions of Runx2 and Osterix in SaOS-2 cells. CONCLUSION: In summary, ZP treatment inhibited alveolar bone loss as well as maintained the integrity of periodontal structures via regulation of bone remodeling. ZP may be a therapeutic target for treating periodontitis.	ZP periodontitis
1	Anticonvulsant, antidepressant-like activity of Abelmoschus manihot ethanol extract and its potential active components in vivo.Depression is the most common psychiatric comorbidity in patients with epilepsy. Searching for antiepileptic (anticonvulsant) and antidepressant-like medicines from natural products is very important for the treatment of this disease. The flower of Abelmoschus manihot (Linn.) Medicus has been reported to have neuroprotective effect against cerebral ischemia injury. In order to further explore the activity of Abelmoschus manihot on the central nervous system, the anticonvulsant and antidepressant-like effects of Abelmoschus manihot ethanol extract (AMEE) as well as its potential active components in vivo was investigated in the present study. It was found that AMEE could protect mice against PTZ-induced clonic convulsions and mortality. AMEE could also decrease immobility time in the FST in mice. Furthermore, the potential active components of AMEE in rat brain were identified by ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometer (UPLC-MS). Five parent components including isoquercitrin, hyperoside, hibifolin, quercetin-3'-O-glucoside, quercetin and three metabolites were detected in rat brain after administration of AMEE. In conclusion, eight flavonoids were identified in rat brain after administration of AMEE; meanwhile, these flavonoids might represent the potential bioactive components of AMEE and contribute to its anticonvulsant and antidepressant-like activity in vivo.	abelmoschus manihot hyperoside
2	In vivo antitrypanosomal effects of some ethnomedicinal plants from Nupeland of north central Nigeria.Four medicinal plants Acacia nilotica, Bombax buonopozense, Terminalia avicennioides and Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides traditionally used for treatment of sleeping sickness in Nupeland were investigated for in vivo antitrypanosomal activity. Methanol extracts of different parts of each plant (stem barks and fruits) were obtained and evaluated for their in vivo antitrypanosomal activities against Trypanosoma brucei brucei. Phytochemical screening of the methanol extracts of each plant were performed by standard procedures. Methanol extracts of A. nilotica (stem bark), B. buonopozense (stem bark), T. avicennioides (round fruit) and Z. zanthoxyloides (stem bark) were effective on trypanosomes. The extracts of A. nilotica and B. buonopozense exhibited antitrypanosomal effects at 200 and 300 mg/kg body weight respectively. Doses were able to clear the parasites from circulation within 6 and 7 days of treatment respectively with prolonging survival period of up to 30 days. While the extracts of T. avicennioides and Z. zanthoxyloides showed trypanostatic effects and could not clear the parasites completely. The methanol extracts of these plants contain metabolites that are associated with antitrypanosomal effects; therefore, these medicinal plants may be sources of new compounds that may be active against T. b. brucei. This study has also justified the claim that some medicinal plants of Nupeland possess antitrypanosomal activity and could be useful in the management of trypanosomiasis.	trypanosoma brucei brucei trypanosomiasis
1	Stimulatory effect of Cinnamomum cassia and cinnamic acid on angiogenesis through up-regulation of VEGF and Flk-1/KDR expression.Complementary and alternative medicine, Cinnamomum cassia is one of the medicinal plants that have been used to improve various diseases caused by insufficient blood circulation. However, relatively little work has been carried out on the angiogenic responses of C. cassia and its active compound cinnamic acid (CA), despite its excellent pharmacological action. In this study, we study the effect of the ethanol extract of C. cassia (CCE) and its active compound CA, on angiogenic processes in in vitro and in vivo. In the Matrigel plug assay in vivo, CCE and CA dose dependently increased von Willebrand Factor (vWF) antigen expression, and hemoglobin contents, whose elevation paralleled the onset of angiogenesis and was considered an early indicator of endothelial activation. CCE and CA induced endothelial cells proliferation, migration and tubule-like structure in vitro. The 25-50% increase observed with CCE (at low doses of 1 or 10 ng/ml) in HUVEC and BAEC proliferation was similar to that observed with CA. The migration and tubule-like structure effect were observed with HUVEC and BAEC. However, the effect of CCE, CA and VEGF on cell proliferation, migration and tubule-like structure in HUVEC were bigger than the effect of CCE, CA and VEGF in BAEC. In addition, CCE and CA each induced 2.2-fold and 2.5-fold increases the production of VEGF, the mRNA expression of VEGF and Flk-1/KDR, the receptor involved in proliferation, migration, and tubule-like structure of endothelial cells. These data suggest that CCE and its active compound CA induce angiogenesis in vivo and in vitro, and this pathway is related with VEGF and Flk-1/KDR expression of endothelial cells.	c. cassia cinnamic acid
2	Repellency of aromatic medicinal plant extracts and a steam distillate to Aedes aegypti.The repellent activity of methanol extracts from 23 aromatic medicinal plant species and a steam distillate against female blood-starved Aedes aegypti was examined in the laboratory by skin test and compared with that of N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (deet). Responses varied according to plant species. At a dose of 0.1 mg/cm2, the repellency of extracts of Cinnamomum cassia bark (91%), Nardostachys chinensis rhizome (81%), Paeonia suffruticosa root bark (80%), and Cinnamomum camphora steam distillate (94%) was comparable to deet (82%). The duration of the effectiveness for extracts from C. cassia bark and N. chinensis rhizome was comparable to deet and lasted for approximately 1 h. Relatively short duration of repellency was observed in P. suffruticosa root bark extract and C. camphora steam distillate. The plants described merit further study as potential mosquito repellent agents.	p. suffruticosa mosquito repellent
3	Potential new inorganic antitumour agents from combining the anticancer traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) liriodenine with metal ions, and DNA binding studies.Liriodenine (), an active component of the anticancer traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), was isolated from Zanthoxylum nitidum. Its reactions with Pt(II) and Ru(II) afforded three metal complexes: cis-[PtCl2(L)] (), cis-[PtCl2(L)(DMSO)] (), and cis-[RuCl2(L)(DMSO)2].1.5H2O (), the crystal structures of , and were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction methods. These complexes were fully characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectrophotometry, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies, and ES mass spectrometry. The in vitro cytotoxicity of and complexes against 11 human tumour cell lines was assayed. The metal-based compounds exhibit enhanced cytotoxicity vs. free , suggesting that these compounds display synergy in the combination of metal ions and liriodenine. The binding properties of and its complexes to ct-DNA were investigated through UV-vis, fluorescence, CD spectra, viscosity and agarose gels electrophoretic measurements.	liriodenine tumour
1	Lifting properties of the alkamide fraction from the fruit husks of Zanthoxylum bungeanum.The fruits of various Zanthoxylum species are used as a spice in the Chinese and Japanese cuisine because of their delicate flavour and tingling properties. The lipophilic hydroxyalkamides hydroxy alpha- and beta-sanshools (1a,b) have been identified as the tingling principles of these plants, and previous studies have validated a sanshool-rich lipophilic extract from the fruit husks of Z. bungeanum Maxim. (Zanthalene   ) as an anti-itching cosmetic ingredient. Because tingling is a sort of 'paralytic pungency', and Zanthalene   potently inhibits synaptic transmission, we have investigated its capacity to relax subcutaneous muscles and act as a topical lifting agent for wrinkles. An anti-wrinkles extract rich in spilanthol (2), a lipophilic alkamide having sensory properties similar to those of Zanthalene   , was used as a reference. Short-term (lifting effect) and long-term (anti-wrinkle) improvements of skin roughness parameters were evaluated by both objectives' and subjectives' measurements. An immediate 'lifting' effect was observed with the sanshool-rich lipophilic extract, at dosages at which the reference alkamide extract was inactive in the objective assays. Limited desensitization after repeated application and good overall tolerability were observed, although a modest long-term anti-wrinkle effect was shown by both products. Taken together, these observations validate the use of sanshool-rich lipophilic extracts as an efficacious, immediate-action lifting agent, and exemplify the relevance of sensory observations to foster the development of innovative cosmetic ingredients.	z. bungeanum maxim spilanthol
1	Coumarin and cinnamaldehyde in cinnamon marketed in Italy: a natural chemical hazard?Some plants that are processed into foods often contain natural substances that may be hazardous to human health. One example is coumarin, which is known to cause liver and kidney damage in rats, mice and probably humans. The main source of coumarin in the diet is cinnamon. The name 'cinnamon' is correctly used to refer to Ceylon cinnamon, also known as 'true cinnamon'. However, other plant species are sometimes sold with the label of cinnamon. This is the case of Cinnamomun aromaticum (cassia). In recent years, due to its cheaper price, cassia is replacing true cinnamon in the European food market being largely used in the preparation of some kinds of sweets. Several European health agencies have recently warned against consuming high amounts of cassia due to its high content of coumarin. In this study, 34 samples of cinnamon and 50 samples of cinnamon-containing foodstuffs were collected from the Italian market. Quantitative determinations of coumarin and cinnamaldehyde were performed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with diode array detector (DAD). The analytical method was in-house validated assessing recovery, repeatability, linearity, limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ). The results showed that about 51% of cinnamon samples consisted of cassia, 10% were probably a blend of cassia and Ceylon cinnamon, whereas only 39% were actually Ceylon cinnamon. As far as cinnamon-containing foods are concerned, the samples often exceeded the maximum level fixed in the European Flavourings Directive of 2 mg kg(-1).	cinnamon coumarin
1	Cinnamomols A and B, Immunostimulative Diterpenoids with a New Carbon Skeleton from the Leaves of Cinnamomum cassia.Two diterpenoids with an unprecedented diterpene carbon skeleton, cinnamomols A (1) and B (2), were isolated from the leaves of Cinnamomum cassia. 1 and 2 feature a cage-like, rigid, 5/5/5/5/5/6-fused hexacyclic ring system. The structures of 1 and 2 were established by extensive spectroscopic techniques and single-crystal X-ray diffraction, and their plausible biosynthetic pathways were proposed. 1 and 2 exhibited significant in vitro immunostimulative activity, and the mode of action of 1 was investigated.	cinnamomum cassia diterpene

In order to further explore the activity of Abelmoschus manihot on the central nervous system, the anticonvulsant and antidepressant-like effects of Abelmoschus manihot ethanol extract (AMEE) as well as its potential active components in vivo was investigated in the present study. It was found that AMEE could protect mice against PTZ-induced clonic convulsions and mortality. AMEE could also decrease immobility time in the FST in mice. Furthermore, the potential active components of AMEE in rat brain were identified by ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometer (UPLC-MS). Five parent components including isoquercitrin, hyperoside, hibifolin, quercetin-3'-O-glucoside, quercetin and three metabolites were detected in rat brain after administration of AMEE. In conclusion, eight flavonoids were identified in rat brain after administration of AMEE; meanwhile, these flavonoids might represent the potential bioactive components of AMEE and contribute to its anticonvulsant and antidepressant-like activity in vivo.	abelmoschus manihot flavonoids
1	Phenolic content and antioxidant property of the bark extracts of Ziziphus mucronata Willd. subsp. mucronata Willd.BACKGROUND: Several plants traditionally used in treatment of a variety of infections in South Africa are reported in ethnobotanical surveys. Many of these plants including Ziziphus mucronata subsp. mucronata lack scientific reports to support their medicinal importance. METHODS: The antioxidant activities and phenolic contents of the acetone, ethanol and aqueous extracts of the stems of Z. mucronata subsp. mucronata were evaluated using in vitro standard methods. The total phenol, total flavonoids and proanthocyanidin content were determined spectrophotometrically. Quercetin, Tannic acid and catechin equivalents were used for these parameters. The antioxidant activities of the stem bark extracts of this plant were determined by ABTS, DPPH, and ferrous reducing antioxidant property (FRAP) methods. RESULTS: The quantity of the phenolic compounds, flavonoids and proanthocyanidins detected differ significantly in the various extracts. The phenolics were significantly higher than the flavonoids and proanthocyanidin contents in all the extracts investigated. The ferric reducing ability and the radical scavenging activities of the extracts were very high and dose-dependent. The ethanol extract had the highest antioxidant activity, followed by the acetone extract while the aqueous extract was the least active. Reacting with ABTS, the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were (0.0429 +- 0.04 mg/ml) for aqueous, (0.0317 +- 0.04 mg/ml) for acetone and (0.0306 +- 0.04 mg/ml) for ethanol extracts while they inhibited DPPH radical with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 0.0646 +- 0.02 mg/ml (aqueous), 0.0482 +- 0.02 mg/ml (acetone) and 0.0422 +- 0.03 mg/ml (ethanol). CONCLUSIONS: A correlation between the antioxidant activity and the total phenolic contents of the extracts indicated that phenolic compounds were the dominant contributors to the antioxidant activity of the plant. This study, therefore, demonstrated that Z. mucronata subsp. mucronata has strong antioxidant property and free radical scavenging capability.	z. mucronata subsp flavonoids
1	Purification and characterization of flavonoids from the leaves of Zanthoxylum bungeanum and correlation between their structure and antioxidant activity.Nine flavonoids were isolated and characterized from the leaves of Zanthoxylum bungeanum. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic techniques as quercetin (1), afzelin (2), quercitrin (3), trifolin (4), quercetin-3-O-beta-D-glucoside (5), isorhamnetin 3-O-alpha-L-rhamnoside (6), hyperoside (7), vitexin (8) and rutin (9). All compounds were isolated from the leaves of Z. bungeanum for the first time. Five compounds (2, 4, 5, 6 and 8) were found for the first time in the genus Zanthoxylum. To learn the mechanisms underlying its health benefits, in vitro (DPPH, ABTS, FRAP and lipid peroxidation inhibition assays) and in vivo (protective effect on Escherichia coli under peroxide stress) antioxidant activities of the nine flavonoids were measured. Quercetin and quercetin glycosides (compounds 1, 3, 5, 7, 9) showed the highest antioxidant activity. Structure-activity relationships indicated that the -OH in 4' position on the B ring and the -OH in 7 position on the A ring possessed high antioxidant activity; B ring and/or A ring with adjacent -OH groups could greatly increase their antioxidant ability. Also, due to the different structures of various flavonoids, they will certainly exhibit different antioxidant capacity when the reactions occur in solution or in oil-in-water emulsion. These findings suggest that Z. bungeanum leaves may have health benefits when consumed. It could become a useful supplement for pharmaceutical products and functional food ingredients in both nutraceutical and food industries as a potential source of natural antioxidants. 	z. bungeanum Quercetin
1	Antiprotozoal isoflavan quinones from Abrus precatorius ssp. africanus.A library of 206 extracts from selected South African plants was screened in vitro against a panel of protozoan parasites, Plasmodium falciparum, Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, and Leishmania donovani. A CH2Cl2/MeOH (1 : 1) extract of Abrus precatorius L. ssp. africanus strongly inhibited P. falciparum (98 %), T. b. rhodesiense (100 %), and L. donovani (76 %) when tested at a concentration of 10.0 microg/mL. The active constituents were tracked by HPLC-based activity profiling and isolated by preparative and semipreparative RP-HPLC chromatography. Structures were established by HR-ESIMS, and 1D and 2D NMR (1H, 13C, COSY, HMBC, HSQC, and NOE difference spectroscopy). Five compounds were obtained and identified as two isoflavan hydroquinones, abruquinone H (1) and abruquinone G (2), and three isoflavan quinones, abruquinone I (3), abruquinone B (4), and 7,8,3''5'-tetramethoxyisoflavan-1',4'-quinone (5). Compounds 1 and 3 were new natural products. The absolute configuration of compounds was determined by comparison of electronic circular dichroism spectra with calculated ECD data. Compounds 3 and 4 showed strong activity against T. b. rhodesiense (IC50 values of 0.30 and 0.16 microM, respectively) and good selectivity (selectivity indices of 73.7 and 50.5, respectively).	abrus precatorius isoflavan quinones
2	A comparative antibacterial evaluation of raw and processed Gunja (Abrus precatorius Linn.) seeds.BACKGROUND: Seed of Gunja (Abrus precatorius Linn.), a known poisonous drug, is used extensively in various ayurvedic formulations with great therapeutic significance. Ayurveda recommends the administration of Gunja in diseases like Indralupta (alopecia), Sotha (edema), Krmi (helminthes), Kustha (skin diseases), Kandu (itching), Prameha (urinary disorders) etc., after being treated with specific Sodhana (purification) procedures. OBJECTIVE: To assess the antimicrobial action of of raw and Shodhita (Processed) Gunja seeds. METHODS: Gunja seeds after being processed with Godugdha (cow's milk), Nimbu swarasa (Lemon juice), Kanji (Sour gruel) and water, as the media, were evaluated for its antibacterial effect against clinically important bacterial strains using agar well diffusion method. RESULTS: Aqueous extracts of raw seeds of Gunja exert its antibacterial effect on both Gram positive, as well as Gram negative bacteria but none of the Sodhita Gunja seeds showed any bactericidal effect on any bacterial strains. Chloroform extracts of all the Sodhita Gunja seed extracts could inhibit bacterial growth but with variations. CONCLUSION: The study displayed that chloroform extracts of raw and sodhita samples for bacterial study were much sensitive than the aqueous extracts.	abrus precatorius urinary disorders
2	Antimicrobial activity of plants used as medicinals on an indigenous reserve in Rio das Cobras, Parana, Brazil.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: A considerable percentage of global biodiversity is located in Brazil, a country that also has rich cultural and ethnic diversity. In the community of Rio das Cobras, Parana, plants are still widely used in the health care not only by indigenous people but also by the non-indigenous population that inhabits the region. The investigation of the efficacy and safety of these plants in the treatment of infectious diseases provides insights for future studies of these species allowing the appropriated use by the indigenous people, since few or none study has been conducted so far. AIM OF THE STUDY: Evaluate the antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity of some plants used as medicinal on an indigenous reserve in Rio das Cobras, Parana, Brazil. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The aqueous extracts were obtained by decoction and the 50% and 70% hydroalcoholic extracts by turbo extraction. The extracts were tested against strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, Leishmania amazonensis, Poliovirus and HSV-1. Cytotoxicity assay using VERO cells were also performed. RESULTS: None of the extracts had a selectivity index (SI)&gt;1 for any of the tested bacteria. Only Campomanesia eugenioides and Schinus terebinthifolius had an SI&gt;1.0 for all of the tested Candida species. The best anti-Leishmania activity was obtained with Zanthoxylum rhoifolium and Schinus terebinthifolius. Extracts of Cordia americana were the most effective against herpes simplex virus type 1. Zanthoxylum rhoifolium was the most effective against Poliovirus, and Ocimum gratissimum was effective against both Poliovirus and Herpes Simplex virus. Among the plants investigated in the present study, Zanthoxylum rhoifolium had the fewest cytotoxic effect. CONCLUSIONS: The plants investigated in the present study exhibited potential for future pharmacological uses, but additional studies, especially with regard to in vivo toxicity, must be conducted. The results of this preliminary survey are important for the Rio das Cobras Reserve community for the safe and effective use of plants in the treatment of some infectious diseases.	zanthoxylum rhoifolium infectious diseases
2	Jin Gui Shen Qi Wan, a traditional Chinese medicine, alleviated allergic airway hypersensitivity and inflammatory cell infiltration in a chronic asthma mouse model.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: In Asia, Jin Gui Shen Qi Wan (JGSQW) has been used for hundreds of years to treat asthma. AIM OF THE STUDY: The traditional Chinese medicine JGSQW is composed of Rehmannia glutinosa, Dioscorea opposita, Cornus officinalis, Poria cocos, Paeonia suffruticosa, Alisma orientalis, Aconitum carmichaelii and Cinnamomum cassia. However, the immunological mechanism underlying the effect of JGSQW treatment on asthma remains unclear. This study examined whether JGSQW has the potential to reduce asthma symptoms in mice with chronic asthma induced by recurrent Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Der p) stimulation, as well as its immunoregulatory mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The airways of BALB/c mice were stimulated with Der p (i.t.) once per week (50 muL, 1 mg/mL) for 6 consecutive weeks, and the mice were fed JGSQW (1 g/kg) 30 min prior to the Der p stimulation. Three days after the last stimulation, the mice were sacrificed to evaluate the airway remodelling, infiltration of inflammatory cells, lung histological features, and total IgE in the blood. Additionally, after A549 cells were treated with JGSQW, loganin, or paeoniflorin for 30 min, 10 ng/mL IL-1beta was added to stimulate the A549 cells to evaluate the effect of the medicine on the ICAM-1 gene expression after IL-1beta stimulation. RESULTS: JGSQW significantly reduced the Der p-induced infiltration of inflammatory cells into airways and decreased the total IgE and Der p-specific IgG1 in serum. Collagen assays and histopathological examinations showed that JGSQW reduced lung airway remodelling. Additionally, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay and immunohistochemical staining verified that JGSQW inhibited the NF-kB expression in airway epithelial cell nuclei. JGSQW, loganin, and paeoniflorin inhibited the ICAM-1 gene expression caused by the IL-1beta stimulation of A549 cells, and loganin and paeoniflorin had the maximum inhibitory effect when mixed according to the combination of doses in JGSQW. CONCLUSION: These results indicated that in the chronic asthma mouse model, JGSQW inhibits the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the airways and airway remodelling and exhibits specific immunoregulatory effects. JGSQW with certain doses of loganin and paeoniflorin inhibited ICAM-1 gene expression in epithelial cells.	paeonia suffruticosa asthma
1	3-O-trans-p-coumaroyl-alphitolic acid, a triterpenoid from Zizyphus jujuba, leads to apoptotic cell death in human leukemia cells through reactive oxygen species production and activation of the unfolded protein response.3-O-trans-p-coumaroyl-alphitolic acid (3OTPCA), a triterpenoid isolated from the plant Zizyphus jujuba (ZJ), is known to be cytotoxic to cancer cells; however, the molecular mechanism underlying 3OTPCA-induced cell death remains unknown. Here, we provide novel evidence that 3OTPCA induces apoptotic cell death in human leukemia cells. We found that 3OPTCA induces DNA fragmentation within 24 h after treatment in U937 cells, which was also observed in other leukemia cell lines, including Molt-4 and Jurkat cells. We then investigated other parameters involved in apoptosis, including phosphatidylserine externalization and caspase-3 cleavage in U937 cells treated with 3OTPCA. 3OTPCA caused significant DNA fragmentation, annexin-V binding, and caspase-3 cleavage, indicating that 3OTPCA exerts cytotoxicity through apoptosis induction. RNA-seq analysis revealed that the expression of transcripts associated with the unfolded protein response (UPR), such as spliced XBP-1 and CHOP, were up-regulated by 3OTPCA treatment. 3OTPCA-induced UPR activation may be due to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress because both 3OTPCA and thapsigargin, an endoplasmic Ca2+ transport ATPase inhibitor, increased intracellular calcium levels. 3OTPCA down-regulated the expression of Bcl-2, a target of CHOP, and led to the loss of the mitochondrial membrane, indicating that the intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptotic pathway was triggered by 3OTPCA, likely through UPR activation. Furthermore, we found that 3OTPCA induced superoxide anion generation and, following p38 MAPK phosphorylation, caspase-8 cleavage without affecting Fas expression. It also induced subsequent Bid cleavage, which may enhance the apoptosis triggered by the intrinsic pathway. These findings reveal for the first time that 3OTPCA induces apoptotic cell death through the generation of reactive oxygen species and activation of UPR.	ZJ 3-o-trans-p-coumaroyl-alphitolic acid
3	Silver Fir (Abies alba L.) Polyphenolic Extract Shows Beneficial Influence on Chondrogenesis In Vitro under Normal and Inflammatory Conditions.Several plant polyphenols have been shown to reduce osteoarthritis symptoms due to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. We investigated the effects of two different polyphenolic extracts (Belinal, Pycnogenol) and two different polyphenols (resveratrol, quercetin) on the chondrogenic potential of bone-derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) from healthy donors and patients with osteoarthritis. Our main aim was to determine whether Belinal, a commercially available polyphenolic extract from silver fir (Abies alba L.) branches, has comparable chondrogenic potential with the other tested extract and the polyphenols under inflammatory and non-inflammatory conditions. In our study, Belinal promoted significantly greater chondrogenesis compared to the untreated (p = 0.0289) and resveratrol-treated (p = 0.0468) MSCs from patients with hip osteoarthritis under non-inflammatory conditions. Under inflammatory conditions, chondrogenesis was significantly enhanced for MSCs treated with Belinal compared to the control (p = 0.0483). The other extract and the polyphenols did not show any significant effects on chondrogenesis under non-inflammatory or inflammatory conditions. None of the tested extracts and polyphenols showed significant effects on chondrogenesis in healthy donors, under either non-inflammatory or inflammatory conditions. Our data show that Belinal can boost the chondrogenesis of MSCs derived from patients with osteoarthritis, under both non-inflammatory and inflammatory conditions.	polyphenols osteoarthritis
1	Cloning and molecular characterization of the basic peroxidase isoenzyme from Zinnia elegans, an enzyme involved in lignin biosynthesis.The major basic peroxidase from Zinnia elegans (ZePrx) suspension cell cultures was purified and cloned, and its properties and organ expression were characterized. The ZePrx was composed of two isoforms with a M(r) (determined by matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization time of flight) of 34,700 (ZePrx34.70) and a M(r) of 33,440 (ZePrx33.44). Both isoforms showed absorption maxima at 403 (Soret band), 500, and 640 nm, suggesting that both are high-spin ferric secretory class III peroxidases. M(r) differences between them were due to the glycan moieties, and were confirmed from the total similarity of the N-terminal sequences (LSTTFYDTT) and by the 99.9% similarity of the tryptic fragment fingerprints obtained by reverse-phase nano-liquid chromatography. Four full-length cDNAs coding for these peroxidases were cloned. They only differ in the 5'-untranslated region. These differences probably indicate different ways in mRNA transport, stability, and regulation. According to the k(cat) and apparent K(m)(RH) values shown by both peroxidases for the three monolignols, sinapyl alcohol was the best substrate, the endwise polymerization of sinapyl alcohol by both ZePrxs yielding highly polymerized lignins with polymerization degrees &gt; or =87. Western blots using anti-ZePrx34.70 IgGs showed that ZePrx33.44 was expressed in tracheary elements, roots, and hypocotyls, while ZePrx34.70 was only expressed in roots and young hypocotyls. None of the ZePrx isoforms was significantly expressed in either leaves or cotyledons. A neighbor-joining tree constructed for the four full-length cDNAs suggests that the four putative paralogous genes encoding the four cDNAs result from duplication of a previously duplicated ancestral gene, as may be deduced from the conserved nature and conserved position of the introns.	zinnia elegans lignins

3	Immunostimulatory role of tryptic digest of Abrus agglutinin.Many bioactive peptides are in therapeutic use as immunomodulators at present. The origin of these bioactive peptides is diverse. Such bioactive peptides are reported to be present in enzymatic digest of food and milk proteins. In our previous work we have reported that Abrus agglutinin retains its bioactivity even after heat denaturation but loses its haemagglutination properties. This leads to the supposition that immunostimulatory regions in the protein might be responsible for its in vivo and in vitro stimulatory properties. Thus the bioactivity of tryptic digest of Abrus agglutinin (TDA) was checked in vitro to ascertain the presence of some bioactive region in the protein, which will lead to the discovery of certain immunostimulatory peptides which might be of use in nonspecific immunotherapy. In this study it is observed that TDA stimulates macrophage increasing the phagocytic and bactericidal activity as well as hydrogen peroxide production. TDA also proliferates splenocytes leading to Th1 response and NK cell activation.	TDA Immunostimulatory
1	Cinnamon extract induces tumor cell death through inhibition of NFkappaB and AP1.BACKGROUND: Cinnamomum cassia bark is the outer skin of an evergreen tall tree belonging to the family Lauraceae containing several active components such as essential oils (cinnamic aldehyde and cinnamyl aldehyde), tannin, mucus and carbohydrate. They have various biological functions including anti-oxidant, anti-microbial, anti-inflammation, anti-diabetic and anti-tumor activity. Previously, we have reported that anti-cancer effect of cinnamon extracts is associated with modulation of angiogenesis and effector function of CD8+ T cells. In this study, we further identified that anti-tumor effect of cinnamon extracts is also link with enhanced pro-apoptotic activity by inhibiting the activities NFkappaB and AP1 in mouse melanoma model. METHODS: Water soluble cinnamon extract was obtained and quality of cinnamon extract was evaluated by HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) analysis. In this study, we tested anti-tumor activity and elucidated action mechanism of cinnamon extract using various types of tumor cell lines including lymphoma, melanoma, cervix cancer and colorectal cancer in vitro and in vivo mouse melanoma model. RESULTS: Cinnamon extract strongly inhibited tumor cell proliferation in vitro and induced active cell death of tumor cells by up-regulating pro-apoptotic molecules while inhibiting NFkappaB and AP1 activity and their target genes such as Bcl-2, BcL-xL and survivin. Oral administration of cinnamon extract in melanoma transplantation model significantly inhibited tumor growth with the same mechanism of action observed in vitro. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that anti-tumor effect of cinnamon extracts is directly linked with enhanced pro-apoptotic activity and inhibition of NFkappaB and AP1 activities and their target genes in vitro and in vivo mouse melanoma model. Hence, further elucidation of active components of cinnamon extract could lead to development of potent anti-tumor agent or complementary and alternative medicine for the treatment of diverse cancers.	cinnamomum cassia essential oils
1	[AMWFA method applied to research on changes of essential components and extractive ratioes of herbal pair Cinnamomum cassia and Poria cocos].Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, chemometric resolution method-Alternative movingwindow factor analysis that were proposed recently and the Kovats retention index were used to analyze the essential components of herbal pair Cinnamomum cassia Presl and Poria cocos (CCP-PC) and compare them with those of single herbal Cinnamomum cassia Presl (CCP). 46 and 42 essential components in essential oil of CCP and CCP-PC have been identified individually. Results shows that the number of essential components of CCP and CCP-PC were almost the same, but extractive ratioes of them have changed significantly, some of them were increased obviously, most of them were declined notably instead and even several ingredients of CCP-PC were disappeared due to CCP PC's interaction probably. The main pharmacodynamic ingredients of CCP-PC, 3-phenyl-2-propenal and Cinnamaldehyde were obviously higher contents than that of single CCP. It suggested that there exist certain interactions of the chemical ingredients in compound medicine rather than their sum effect of single medicines. There is a litter difference in quality and quantity between single medicines and pair medicines, so the application of pair medicines can expand single medicine's adaptive disease and has a good clinical referenced valuation.	poria cocos 3-phenyl-2-propenal
4	MAPK inhibitors and pifithrin-alpha block cinnamaldehyde-induced apoptosis in human PLC/PRF/5 cells.Cinnamaldehyde (Cin) has been shown to be effective in inducing apoptotic cell death in a number of human cancer cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of pifithrin-alpha (PFTalpha; a specific p53 inhibitor) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) inhibitors [namely SP600125 (a specific JNK inhibitor), SB203580 (a specific p38 inhibitor) and PD98059 (a specific ERK inhibitor)] on apoptotic signaling transduction mechanism induced by Cin in human hepatoma PLC/PRF/5 (CD95-negative) cells. Using XTT assay, Cin exhibited a powerful cytotoxic effect and apoptotic induction in PLC/PRF/5 cells. Apoptosis was elicited when cells were treated with 1 microM Cin as characterized by morphological changes and the appearance of phosphatidylserine on the outer surface of the plasma membrane. Cin down-regulated the expression of Bcl-(XL), up-regulated mutant p53 and Bax proteins and promoted caspase-3 to active forms, as well as cleaving poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in a time-dependent pattern. This could be supported by the activation and phosphorylation of MAPKs, including JNK, ERK and p38 kinases. Pre-incubation with PFTalpha and specific MAPK inhibitors significantly diminished the effect of Cin-induced apoptosis. The activities of anti-apoptotic (Bcl-(XL)) and pro-apoptotic (Bax) proteins were remarkably affected by PFTalpha and PD98059 pre-treatment. PFTalpha effectively blocked PARP cleavage in cells treated with Cin, and also markedly prevented the phosphorylation of JNK, p38 and ERK proteins. These results suggest that p53 induction and MAPK signaling pathways are required for Cin-mediated apoptosis in PLC/PRF/5 cells.	PLC cancer
2	In vitro anti-Helicobacter pylori action of 30 Chinese herbal medicines used to treat ulcer diseases.Infection by Helicobacter pylori has been ascertained to be an important etiologic impetus leading usually to chronic active gastritis and gastric ulcer with growing incidences worldwide. Utilizing as the test pathogen a standard and five clinic strains of Helicobacter pylori, the antibacterial action was assessed in vitro with ethanol extracts of 30 Chinese herbal medicines which have been frequently prescribed since ancient times for treating gastritis-like disorders. Among the 30 tested materials, the ethanol extracts of Abrus cantoniensis (Fabaceae), Saussurea lappa (Asteraceae) and Eugenia caryophyllata (Myrtaceae) were strongly inhibitory to all test strains (MICs: approximately 40 microg/ml), and Hippophae rhamnoides (Elaeagnaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii (Liliaceae), Magnolia officinalis and Schisandra chinensis (Magnoliaceae), Corydalis yanhusuo (Papaveraceae), Citrus reticulata (Rutaceae), Bupleurum chinense and Ligusticum chuanxiong (Apiaceae) substantially active with MICs close to 60.0 microg/ml. As to antibacterial actions of the aqueous extracts of the same drugs, those derived from Cassia obtusifolia (Fabaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii and Eugenia caryophyllata were remarkably inhibitory against all the six Helicobacter pylori strains (MICs: approximately 60 microg/ml). The work compared almost quantitatively the magnitude of the anti-Helicobacter pylori actions of the 30 most prescribed gastritis-treating Chinese herbal drugs, and located as well some source plants where potent anti-Helicobacter pylori phytochemicals could be characterized.	magnolia officinalis gastritis
2	Anthelmintic properties of alpha-sanshool from Zanthoxylum liebmannianum.The decoction of the stem bark of Zanthoxylum liebmannianum (Engelm.) P. Wilson (Rutaceae) decreased the count of intestinal nematode eggs in naturally infected sheep. In addition, the chloroformic extract was toxic to Ascaris suum. Fractionation of the organic extract guided by the Ascaris suum lethality test led to the isolation of alpha-sanshool (LC50 = 83.4 x 10(-5)M) as the only active compound. On the other hand, alpha-sanshool induced tonic-clonic seizures when it was injected intraperitoneally to mice. This finding could be a warning regarding the potential toxicity of this plant.	ascaris suum alpha-sanshool
4	Combined treatment with Cinnamaldehyde and beta-TCP had an additive effect on bone formation and angiogenesis in critical size calvarial defect in ovariectomized rats.Accumulating evidence suggests that improvements in osteogenesis and angiogenesis play an important role in repairing osteoporotic bone defects. Cinnamomum cassia (C. cassia), a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, is reported to show anabolic effects on osteoblasts. However, whether C. cassia could actually repair bone defects in osteoporotic conditions remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of combined treatment with Cinnamaldehyde (main oil isolated from the C. cassia) and beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP) on bone formation and angiogenesis in critical size calvarial defects in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Using a previously established OVX model, 5 mm critical size calvarial defect was established in OVX rats. All OVX rats were then randomly divided into OVX group (OVX rats + empty defect), TCP group (OVX rats + beta-TCP), and CTCP group (Cinnamaldehyde 75 mg/kg/day for 12 weeks + beta-TCP). Twelve weeks after treatment, according to Micro-CT and HE staining, combination of Cinnamaldehyde and beta-TCP had an additive effect on bone regeneration compared with other groups (p &lt; 0.05). Based on dynamic fluorochrome-labelling analysis, Cinnamaldehyde+beta-TCP continuously promoted new bone mineralization compared with other groups at each time point (p &lt; 0.05). Microfil perfusion suggested that CTCP group showed more neovascularization compared with other groups (p &lt; 0.05). Immunohistochemical assay supported the findings that Cinnamaldehyde+beta-TCP enhanced expression of OCN, VEGF and CD31. The present study demonstrated that combined treatment with Cinnamaldehyde and beta-TCP promoted bone formation and angiogenesis in osteoporotic bone defects, which provides a promising new strategy for repairing bone defects in osteoporotic conditions.

1	High-performance liquid chromatography--two wavelength detection of triterpenoid acids from the fruits of Ziziphus jujuba containing various cultivars in different regions and classification using chemometric analysis.A simple and sensitive HPLC-DAD method has been developed for the first time to simultaneously determine 10 triterpenoid acids (ceanothic acid, alphitolic acid, zizyberanal acid, zizyberanalic acid, epiceanothic acid, ceanothenic acid, betulinic acid, oleanolic acid, ursonic acid and zizyberenalic acid) in the dried fruit of Ziziphus jujuba (called Dazao) which has been widely used as one of the traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs). This HPLC assay was performed on a reversed-phase C(18) column (250 mm x 4.6mm, 5 microm) with the column temperature at 35 degrees C. The mobile phase was composed of A (acetonitrile) and B (0.05% aqueous phosphoric acid, v/v). The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min and the detection wave length was set at 205 nm for reference compounds 1-9 and 238 nm for reference compound 10. All calibration curves showed good linear regression (r(2)&gt;0.9999) within the test range. The established method showed good precision and accuracy with overall intra-day and inter-day variations of 0.43-1.72% and 0.53-2.45%, respectively, and overall recoveries of 94.98-104.09% for the 10 compounds analyzed. The validated method was successfully applied for the simultaneous determination of the 10 triterpenoid acids in 42 batches of Dazao which contained 36 cultivars from 22 cultivation regions, and were investigated and authenticated as Z. jujuba. Hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) and principal components analysis (PCA) were performed to differentiate and classify the samples based on the contents of the 10 triterpenoid acids. The presented HPLC-DAD method conjugated with chemometrics approach was demonstrated to be very helpful in using Dazao resources, and was possibly useful in chemotaxonomic characterization.	z. jujuba zizyberanalic acid
1	[Absorption of flavonoids from Abelmoschus manihot extract by in situ intestinal perfusion].To explore the mechanism of the absorption of flavonoids from Abelmoschus manihot flowers, in situ intestinal recirculation was performed to study the effect of the absorption at different concentrations and different intestinal regions. To evaluate the conditions of the absorption of six flavonoids from Abelmoschus manihot flowers, the concentrations of Abelmoschus manihot in the perfusion solution were determined by HPLC at predesigned time. And we have investigated the inhibitory effect of six flavonoids from Abelmoschus manihot flowers on P-glycoprotein (P-gp) drug efflux pump. The results demonstrated that the absorption rates of flavonoids from Abelmoschus manihot flowers are not significantly different (P &gt; 0.05) at various drug concentrations, the absorption of flavonoids from Abelmoschus manihot flowers is a first-order process with the passive diffusion mechanism. The absorption rates of each of flavonoids are significantly different. The absorption rate of flavonoid glycoside was lower than that of aglycone; the flavonoids from Abelmoschus manihot flowers could be absorbed in all of the intestinal segments. The best parts of intestine to absorb hyperoside and myricetin are jejunum and duodenum, separately. Verapamil could enhance the absorption of isoquercitrin, hyperoside, myricetin and quercetin-3'-O-glucoside by inhibiting P-glycoprotein (P-gp) drug efflux pump.	abelmoschus manihot hyperoside
2	A 12-Week, Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial for Evaluation of the Efficacy and Safety of DKB114 on Reduction of Uric Acid in Serum.This study sought to investigate the antihyperuricemia efficacy and safety of DKB114 (a mixture of Chrysanthemum indicum Linn flower extract and Cinnamomum cassia extract) to evaluate its potential as a dietary supplement ingredient. This clinical trial was a randomized, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. A total of 80 subjects (40 subjects with an intake of DKB114 and 40 subjects with that of placebo) who had asymptomatic hyperuricemia (7.0-9.0 mg/dL with serum uric acid) was randomly assigned. No significant difference between the DKB114 and placebo groups was observed in the amount of uric acid in serum after six weeks of intake. However, after 12 weeks of intake, the uric acid level in serum of subjects in the DKB114 group decreased by 0.58 +- 0.86 mg/dL and was 7.37 +- 0.92 mg/dL, whereas that in the placebo group decreased by 0.02 +- 0.93 mg/dL and was 7.67 +- 0.89 mg/dL, a significant difference (p = 0.0229). In the analysis of C-reactive protein (CRP) change, after 12 weeks of administration, the DKB114 group showed an increase of 0.05 +- 0.27 mg/dL (p = 0.3187), while the placebo group showed an increase of 0.10 +- 0.21 mg/dL (p = 0.0324), a statistically significant difference (p = 0.0443). In the analysis of amount of change in apoprotein B, after 12 weeks of administration, the DKB114 group decreased by 4.75 +- 16.69 mg/dL (p = 0.1175), and the placebo group increased by 3.13 +- 12.64 mg/dL (p = 0.2187), a statistically significant difference between the administration groups (p = 0.0189). In the clinical pathology test, vital signs and weight measurement, and electrocardiogram test conducted for safety evaluation, no clinically significant difference was found between the ingestion groups, confirming the safety of DKB114. Therefore, it may have potential as a treatment for hyperuricemia and gout. We suggest that DKB114 as a beneficial and safe food ingredient for individuals with high serum uric acid.

1	Total Phenolics and Total Flavonoids Contents and Hypnotic Effect in Mice of Ziziphus mauritiana Lam. Seed Extract.The seeds of Ziziphus mauritiana Lam. have been traditionally used for treatment of various complications including insomnia and anxiety. They are popularly used as sedative and hypnotic drugs in China, Korea, Myanmar, Vietnam, and other Asian countries. However, no scientific proof on hypnotic activity of Z. mauritiana seeds (ZMS) was reported. In this study, the hypnotic activity of 50% ethanolic extract from ZMS was observed on the loss of righting reflex in mice using pentobarbital-induced sleep mice method. The contents of total phenolics and total flavonoids in the extract were also determined. The results showed that the 50% ethanolic extract from ZMS contained total phenolics 27.62 +- 1.43 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g extract and total flavonoids 0.74 +- 0.03 mg quercetin equivalent (QE)/g extract. Oral administration of the extract at the dose of 200 mg/kg significantly increased the sleeping time in mice intraperitoneally administered with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg body weight). These results supported the traditional use of ZMS for the treatment of insomnia. The seeds of Z. mauritiana should be further developed as an alternative sedative and/or hypnotic product. 	z. mauritiana gallic acid
2	Inhibitory effect of 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde on nitric oxide production through inhibition of NF-kappa B activation in RAW 264.7 cells.Cinnamomum cassia has been widely used for treating dyspepsia, gastritis, and inflammatory disease. In the present study, several of cinnamaldehyde derivatives were synthesized from various cinnamic acid based on the 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde isolated from the bark C. cassia Blume was investigated to compare their NO production and NF-kappa B activity from Raw 264.7 cell since nitric oxide (NO) and NF-kappa B have been shown to be implicated factors in the inflammatory disease. The results show that HCA, among the derivatives, most significantly inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NO production and NF-kappa B transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner with an IC(50) value of 8 and 22 microM, respectively. We next investigated putative possible mechanisms of inhibitory effect of HCA on NO production. The inhibition of NO by HCA was consistent with the inhibitory effect on LPS-induced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression. Moreover, HCA inhibited LPS-induced p50 and p65 translocation resulting in the inhibition of the DNA binding activity of the NF-kappa B, a central regulator of iNOS. The present results provided evidence that HCA, among cinnamaledhyde derivatives, has the most inhibitory effect on NO production through inhibition of NF-kappa B activation, and thus can be used as an anti-inflammatory agent.	c. cassia gastritis
1	In vitro activities of plant extracts on human Loa loa isolates and cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells.Loa loa, a filarial worm, can cause fatal encephalitis in humans. In an attempt to find alternatives to the standard treatments (ivermectin and diethylcarbamazine citrate), we tested 12 methanolic extracts of nine traditional plant remedies. The extracts (100-0.09 microg/ml) were incubated with 20 Loa loa microfilariae isolated from patients at 37 degrees C with 5% CO(2) in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal serum and antibiotics. Activity was evaluated 120 h later by counting live microfilariae under a microscope. Cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells was estimated by measuring 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2-5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide transformation to formazan at 450 nM in a spectrophotometer. The plants tested were Lophira alata, Greenwayodendron suaveolens, Uapaca togoensis, Zanthoxylum heitzii, Peperomia pellucida, Piptadeniastrum africanum, Petersianthus macrocarpus, Vernonia conferta, and Vernonia hymenolepis. Chemical screening showed that most of the extracts contained reducing sugars, tannin or polyphenols, sterols or triterpenes, saponosides, and alkaloids. None contained carotinoids and few contained flavonoids. The 50% lethal concentration ranged from 0.22 to 70.28 microg/ml, while the 50% inhibitory concentration for eukaryotic cells (IC(50)) ranged from 8.52 to 119.52 microg/ml. Extracts of P. macrocarpus (selectivity index = 72.16), P. africanum (13.69), Z. heitzii (12.11), and L. alata (9.26) were highly selective for L. loa.	p. africanum triterpenes
1	Foliar and cortex oleoresin variability of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) in Albania.Terpene composition of needle and cortical oleoresin from lateral shoots were analyzed by GC/MS for four Silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) populations scattered in natural species range in Albania. More than sixty compounds were detected in the needle oleoresin, which was characterized by a high content of alpha-pinene, camphene, beta-pinene, limonene and bornyl acetate. Three monoterpenes, alpha-pinene, beta-pinene and limonene, and two sesquiterpenes, beta-caryophyllene and germacrene D, comprised the majority of cortical oleoresin. The terpene composition differences among the populations that led to the recognition of two chemotypes. The needle oleoresin from the provinces of Puka, Bulqiza and Llogara were characterised by high amounts of beta-pinene, camphene and alpha-pinene and low amounts of limonene, while that from Drenova had high amounts of beta-pinene and limonene. A similar pattern was found in the cortical oleoresin with the exception of camphene that was a minor contributor. Geographical and seasonal variation between the populations was, also, investigated. Multivariate analysis of both needle and cortical oleoresin separated Drenova (southeastern population) from the other sites. When both major monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes were considered four chemical profiles could be attributed. Based on their chemical profiles, the populations can be divided into two groups: Populations with high content of beta-pinene and alpha-pinene but a low content of limonene (Puka, Bulqiza and Llogara), typical of most of A. alba populations in all its distribution range. Population with a high content of limonene and a moderate content of beta-pinene and alpha-pinene (Drenova).	a. alba sesquiterpenes
2	Regulation of Caspase-3 and Bcl-2 Expression in Dalton's Lymphoma Ascites Cells by Abrin.The role of abrin, a toxic lectin isolated from seeds of Abrus precatorius Linn in inducing apoptosis in murine Dalton's Lymphoma Ascites (DLA) cells was evaluated. Abrin when incubated at the concentration of 10 ng per million DLA cells could bring about cell death as typical morphological changes with apoptosis. However, necrotic cell death dominated when a higher dose of abrin was used. DNA samples, isolated from DLA cells treated with abrin showed fragmentation. Abrin brought about induction of apoptosis by stimulating the expression of pro-apoptotic Caspase-3, at the same time blocking the expression of Bcl-2, which is an anti apoptotic gene. However, the expression of tumor suppressor gene p53 has not been observed in control and abrin-treated DLA cells. Results suggested that abrin effectively induced apoptotic changes in the tumor cells that led to cellular death.	abrus precatorius dalton's lymphoma ascites
1	In vitro activities of plant extracts on human Loa loa isolates and cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells.Loa loa, a filarial worm, can cause fatal encephalitis in humans. In an attempt to find alternatives to the standard treatments (ivermectin and diethylcarbamazine citrate), we tested 12 methanolic extracts of nine traditional plant remedies. The extracts (100-0.09 microg/ml) were incubated with 20 Loa loa microfilariae isolated from patients at 37 degrees C with 5% CO(2) in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal serum and antibiotics.

1	High-throughput screening for anti-influenza A virus drugs and study of the mechanism of procyanidin on influenza A virus-induced autophagy.In this research, we have established a high-throughput screening (HTS) platform based on the influenza A virus (IAV) vRNA promoter. Using this HTS platform, we selected 35 medicinal plants out of 83 examples of traditional Chinese medicine and found that 7 examples had not been reported. After examining many previous reports, we found that Vaccinium angustifolium Ait., Vitis vinifera L, and Cinnamomum cassia Presl had a common active compound, procyanidin, and then determined the anti-IAV effect of procyanidin and explored its mechanism of action. With a plaque inhibition assay and a time-of-addition experiment, we found that procyanidin could inhibit the IAV replication at several stages of the life cycle. In the Western blot and EGFP-LC3 localization assays, we found that procyanidin could inhibit the accumulation of LC3II and the dot-like aggregation of EGFP-LC3. In the RT-PCR and Western blot assays, we found procyanidin could inhibit the expression of Atg7, Atg5, and Atg12. Finally, by the bimolecular fluorescence complementation-fluorescence resonance energy transfer and co-immunoprecipitation assays, we found that procyanidin could inhibit the formation of the Atg5-Atg12/Atg16 heterotrimer and the dissociation of the beclin1/bcl2 heterodimer. In conclusion, we have established an HTS platform and identified procyanidin as a novel and promising anti-IAV agent.	cinnamomum cassia procyanidin
1	Cinnamaldehyde inhibits lymphocyte proliferation and modulates T-cell differentiation.Two kinds of cinnamaldehyde derivative, 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (HCA) and 2'-benzoxy-cinnamaldehyde (BCA), were studied for their immunomodulatory effects. These compounds were screened as anticancer drug candidates from stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia for their inhibitory effect on farnesyl protein transferase activity. Ras activation, which is accompanied with its farnesylation, has been known to be important in immune cell activation as well as in carcinogenesis. Treatment of these cinnamaldehydes to mouse splenocyte cultures induced suppression of lymphoproliferation following both Con A and LPS stimulation in a dose-dependent manner. A dose of I microM of HCA and BCA inhibited the Con A-stimulated proliferation by 69% and 60%, and the LPS-induced proliferation by 29% and 21%, respectively. However, the proliferation induced by PMA plus ionomycin was affected by neither HCA nor BCA treatment. Decreased levels of antibody production by HCA or BCA treatment were observed in both SRBC-immunized mice and LPS-stimulated splenocyte cultures. The exposure of thymocytes to HCA or BCA for 48 h accelerated T-cell differentiation from CD4 and CD8 double positive cells to CD4 or CD8 single positive cells. The inhibitory effect of cinnamaldehyde on lymphoproliferation was specific to the early phase of cell activation, showing the strongest inhibition of Con A- or LPS-stimulated proliferation when added concomitantly with the mitogens. In addition, the treatment of HCA and BCA to splenocyte cultures attenuated the Con A-triggered progression of cell cycle at G1 phase with no inhibition of S to G2/M phase transition. Although cinnamaldehyde treatment had no effect on the IL-2 production by splenocyte cultures stimulated with Con A, it inhibited markedly and dose-dependently the expression of IL-2Ralpha and interferon-gamma. Taken together, the results in this study suggest both HCA and BCA inhibit the lymphoproliferation and induce a T-cell differentiation through the blockade of early steps in signaling pathway leading to cell growth.	cinnamomum cassia BCA
1	Enhanced repellency of binary mixtures of Zanthoxylum piperitum pericarp steam distillate or Zanthoxylum armatum seed oil constituents and Calophyllum inophyllum nut oil and their aerosols to Stomoxys calcitrans.BACKGROUND: The repellency to stable fly, Stomoxys calcitrans (L.), of Zanthoxylum piperitum (L.) DC pericarp steam distillate (ZP-SD), Zanthoxylum armatum DC seed oil (ZA-SO) and their constituents alone or in combination with Calophyllum inophyllum L. nut oil (CI-NO), as well as six aerosol formulations containing ZP-SD or ZP-SO and CI-NO, was compared with that of a synthetic repellent, DEET, using an exposed human hand bioassay. RESULTS: At 0.20 mg cm(-2), ZP-SD treatments resulted in 91 and 68% repellency following 30 and 60 min exposure respectively, while DEET gave 100 and 84% repellency. ZA-SO was less effective than ZP-SD. At 0.2 mg cm(-2), the most active constituents, cuminaldehyde, cuminyl alcohol, limonene and methyl cinnamate, gave 82, 74, 74 and 64% repellency at 30 min respectively, but DEET gave 100 and 87% repellency at 30 and 60 min. An increase in effectiveness and duration of repellency was produced by binary mixtures of ZP-SD, ZA-SO or bioactive constituents (each 0.01 mg cm(-2)) and CI-NO (0.99 mg cm(-2)). The repellency of aerosols containing 2.5% ZP-SD or 2.5% ZA-SO and 2.5% CI-NO was comparable with that of 5% DEET aerosol. CONCLUSION: Mixtures formulated from ZP-SD, ZA-SO or bioactive constituents and CI-NO could be useful as potential repellents for the control of stable fly populations in light of global efforts to reduce the level of highly toxic synthetic repellents.	zanthoxylum piperitum (l.) dc methyl cinnamate
4	Deacetylation of LAMP1 drives lipophagy-dependent generation of free fatty acids by Abrus agglutinin to promote senescence in prostate cancer.Therapy-induced senescence in cancer cells is an irreversible antiproliferative state, which inhibits tumor growth and is therefore a potent anti-neoplastic mechanism. In this study, low doses of Abrus agglutinin (AGG)-induced senescence through autophagy in prostate carcinoma cells (PC3) and inhibited proliferation. The inhibition of autophagy with 3-methyl adenine reversed AGG-induced senescence, thus confirming that AGG-triggered senescence required autophagy. AGG treatment also led to lipophagy-mediated accumulation of free fatty acids (FFAs), with a concomitant decrease in the number of lipid droplets. Lalistat, a lysosomal acid lipase inhibitor, abrogated AGG-induced lipophagy and senescence in PC3 cells, indicating that lipophagy is essential for AGG-induced senescence. The accumulation of FFAs increased reactive oxygen species generation, a known facilitator of senescence, which was also reduced in the presence of lalistat. Furthermore, AGG upregulated silent mating type information regulator 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1), while the presence of sirtinol reduced autophagy flux and the senescent phenotype in the AGG-treated cells. Mechanistically, AGG-induced cytoplasmic SIRT1 deacetylated a Lys residue on the cytoplasmic domain of lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1), an autolysosomal protein, resulting in lipophagy and senescence. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a novel SIRT1/LAMP1/lipophagy axis mediating AGG-induced senescence in prostate cancer cells.	LAMP1 prostate cancer
1	Cinnamon extract induces tumor cell death through inhibition of NFkappaB and AP1.BACKGROUND: Cinnamomum cassia bark is the outer skin of an evergreen tall tree belonging to the family Lauraceae containing several active components such as essential oils (cinnamic aldehyde and cinnamyl aldehyde), tannin, mucus and carbohydrate. They have various biological functions including anti-oxidant, anti-microbial, anti-inflammation, anti-diabetic and anti-tumor activity. Previously, we have reported that anti-cancer effect of cinnamon extracts is associated with modulation of angiogenesis and effector function of CD8+ T cells. In this study, we further identified that anti-tumor effect of cinnamon extracts is also link with enhanced pro-apoptotic activity by inhibiting the activities NFkappaB and AP1 in mouse melanoma model. METHODS: Water soluble cinnamon extract was obtained and quality of cinnamon extract was evaluated by HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) analysis. In this study, we tested anti-tumor activity and elucidated action mechanism of cinnamon extract using various types of tumor cell lines including lymphoma, melanoma, cervix cancer and colorectal cancer in vitro and in vivo mouse melanoma model. RESULTS: Cinnamon extract strongly inhibited tumor cell proliferation in vitro and induced active cell death of tumor cells by up-regulating pro-apoptotic molecules while inhibiting NFkappaB and AP1 activity and their target genes such as Bcl-2, BcL-xL and survivin. Oral administration of cinnamon extract in melanoma transplantation model significantly inhibited tumor growth with the same mechanism of action observed in vitro. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that anti-tumor effect of cinnamon extracts is directly linked with enhanced pro-apoptotic activity and inhibition of NFkappaB and AP1 activities and their target genes in vitro and in vivo mouse melanoma model. Hence, further elucidation of active components of cinnamon extract could lead to development of potent anti-tumor agent or complementary and alternative medicine for the treatment of diverse cancers.	cinnamomum cassia tannin
2	A Monoclonal-Monoclonal Antibody Based Capture ELISA for Abrin.Abrin, one of the most highly potent toxins in the world, is derived from the plant, Abrus precatorius. Because of its high toxicity, it poses potential bioterror risks. Therefore, a need exists for new reagents and technologies that would be able to rapidly detect abrin contamination as well as lead to new therapeutics. We report here a group of abrin-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that recognize abrin A-chain, intact A-B chain toxin, and agglutinin by Western blot. Additionally, these mAbs were evaluated for their ability to serve as capture antibodies for a sandwich (capture) ELISA. All possible capture-detector pairs were evaluated and the best antibody pair identified and optimized for a capture ELISA. The capture ELISA based on this capture-detector mAb pair had a limit of detection (L.O.D) of  1 ng/mL measured using three independent experiments. The assay did not reveal any false positives with extracts containing other potential ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs). Thus, this new capture ELISA uses mAbs for both capture and detection; has no cross-reactivity against other plant RIPs; and has a sensitivity comparable to other reported capture ELISAs using polyclonal antibodies as either capture or detector.	abrus precatorius toxicity
1	Toxicity of Zanthoxylum piperitum and Zanthoxylum armatum oil constituents and related compounds to Stomoxys calcitrans (Diptera: Muscidae).Zanthoxylum plants (Rutaceae) have drawn attention because they contain insecticidal principles against insects. An assessment was made of the insecticidal and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activities of Zanthoxylum piperitum steam distillate and Zanthoxylum armatum seed oil, their 28 constituents, and eight structurally related compounds against female stable fly, Stomoxys calcitrans (L.). Results were compared with those of two organophosphorus insecticides chlorpyrifos and dichlorvos. Potent fumigant toxicity was observed with cuminaldehyde, thymol, (1S)-(-)-verbenone, (-)-myrtenal, carvacrol, (S)-(Z)-verbenol, Zanthoxylum piperitum steam distillate, cuminyl alcohol, Zanthoxylum armatum seed oil, piperitone, (-)-(Z)-myrtanol, and citronellal (LC50, 0.075-0.456 microg/cm3). However, they were five orders of magnitude less toxic than either chlorpyrifos or dichlorvos. An in vitro bioassay using female fly heads indicates that strong AChE inhibition was produced by citronellyl acetate, alpha-pinene, thymol, carvacrol, and alpha-terpineol (1.20-2.73 mM), but no direct correlation between fly toxicity and AChE inhibition by the test compounds was observed. Structure-activity relationships indicate that structural characteristics, such as carbon skeleton, degrees of saturation and types of functional groups, and vapor pressure parameter, appear to play a role in determining toxicities of the test monoterpenoids to stable flies. Global efforts to reduce the level of highly toxic synthetic insecticides in the agricultural environment justify further studies on Z. piperitum and Z. armatum oil-derived materials as potential insecticides for the control of stable fly populations.	z. piperitum thymol
1	Effect of drying of jujubes (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) on the contents of sugars, organic acids, alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene, and phenolic compounds.This study investigated the changes in sugars, organic acids, alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene, phenolic profiles, total phenolic content (TPC), and antioxidant capacity of jujube fruits after four drying treatments (sun-, oven-, microwave- and freeze-drying). Sugar, organic acid, phenolic compounds, alpha-tocopherol, and beta-carotene were qualitatived and quantitatived by high-performance liquid chromatography. The TPC and antioxidant activity of jujube samples were evaluated using the Folin-Ciocalteau method and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical scavenging activity, respectively. Freeze-drying resulted in jujubes with higher antioxidant activity and was also a good choice for the preparation of beta-carotene from jujubes for the food industry. Microwave-dried jujubes had a higher content of protocatechuic acid, catechin, and epicatechin and maintained the same antioxidant capacity with the freeze-dried jujubes. The combination of microwave- and freeze-drying may be an efficient alternative with shorter processing time and, consequently, less impact on the nutritional value of the jujube.	jujube beta-carotene
0	Corilagin suppresses RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and inhibits oestrogen deficiency-induced bone loss via the NF-kappaB and PI3K/AKT signalling pathways.Over-activated osteoclastogenesis, which is initiated by inflammation, has been implicated in osteoporosis. Corilagin, a natural compound extracted from various medicinal herbaceous plants, such as Cinnamomum cassia, has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. We found that Corilagin suppressed osteoclast differentiation in a dose-dependent manner, significantly decreased osteoclast-related gene expression and impaired bone resorption by osteoclasts. Moreover, phosphorylation of members of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and PI3K/AKT signalling pathways was reduced by Corilagin. In a murine model of osteoporosis, Corilagin inhibited osteoclast functions in vivo and restored oestrogen deficiency-induced bone loss. In conclusion, our findings suggested that Corilagin inhibited osteoclastogenesis by down-regulating the NF-kappaB and PI3K/AKT signalling pathways, thus showing its potential possibility for the treatment of osteoporosis.

4	Plant-derived abrin-a induces apoptosis in cultured leukemic cell lines by different mechanisms.Abrin-a consists of A-chain with N-glycosidase activity, which inhibits protein synthesis, and lectin-like B-chain responsible for binding with cell-surface receptors and penetrating of abrin-a molecule into the cells. As a lectin component, the B-chain can also participate in cell signal transduction. It has been reported that abrin induces apoptosis, but the molecular mechanism(s) of this induction have been obscure and several alternative variants have been discussed. The present study demonstrates that abrin-a induces apoptosis in human cultured cell lines, derived from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (Jurkat, CCRF-CEM, MOLT-4, HPB-ALL). The apoptosis was estimated by: phosphatidylserine (PSer) exposure at the cell surface, activation of caspase cascade, and DNA fragmentation. The penetrating of abrin-a into the cells was detected by fluorescent confocal microscopy, using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) as a fluorescent marker. It was established that the effect of abrin-a on the apoptosis induction in leukemic cells was dose- and time-dependent. The process was initiated 1 h after abrin-a application (before its penetrating into the cells) and was characterized with PSer translocation from the inner to the outer monolayer of plasma membrane, caspase activation on the first to second hour after beginning of treatment, with maximum on the third to fourth hour, and DNA fragmentation on the fourth to sixth hour, depending of the cell line. The exposure of PSer on the cell surface was detected in Jurkat, CCRF-CEM, and MOLT-4 cells. In HPB-ALL, no significant changes in PSer exposure on the cell surface was observed. Activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9 was detected in Jurkat, MOLT-4, and HPB-ALL. Surprisingly, the activity of caspase-3 increased on the first hour after beginning of treatment, while the activity of caspase-8 and -9 began to increase on the second hour. In CCRF-CEM, activation of caspases was not measured, but the apoptosis progressed to DNA fragmentation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. DNA fragmentation was also detected in Jurkat, but not in MOLT-4 and HPB-ALL cells. It seems that the mechanisms of abrin-a-induced apoptosis are different and the progress of apoptosis depends of the cell line. There was a very good positive correlation between the agglutinating activity of abrin-a and development of apoptosis to DNA fragmentation. The time-dependent effects of abrin-a on apoptosis as well as its time-dependent penetration into the cells suggest that the B-chain probably triggers the apoptosis, while the A-chain and breakage of the disulfide bond are responsible for its progress.	caspase-3 acute lymphoblastic leukemia
2	Inhibition of collagen-induced platelet aggregation and adhesion by a pseudocyanide derivative of avicine isolated from Zanthoxylum integrifoliolum Merr.Avicine pseudocyanide, a derivative of avicine isolated from Zanthoxylum integrifoliolum Merr., inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation and release reaction in a concentration-dependent manner. Trimucytin is a collagen-like snake venom protein isolated from Trimeresurus mucrosquamatus. Avicine pseudocyanide also inhibited trimucytin (1 microgram/mL)-induced platelet aggregation and release reaction concentration dependently. The IC50 values of avicine pseudocyanide on collagen (10 micrograms/mL)- and trimucytin (1 microgram/mL)-induced platelet aggregation were 47.3 +/- 4.1 and 62.5 +/- 5.6 microM, respectively. Avicine pseudocyanide at a concentration of 300 microM inhibited less than 30% of platelet aggregation induced by ADP (20 microM), AA (100 microM), U46619 (1 microM), PAF (2 ng/mL) and thrombin (0.1 U/mL). The concentration-response curve of collagen-induced platelet aggregation was shifted to the right by avicine pseudocyanide (20-100 microM) concentration dependently. The Schild plot showed that pA2 and pA10 values of avicine pseudocyanide were 4.8 and 4.3, respectively, with slope of -1.9. Avicine pseudocyanide also inhibited collagen (10 micrograms/mL)-induced aggregation of rabbit whole blood with an IC50 of 145 +/- 13 microM. Collagen-induced thromboxane B2 formation was also inhibited by avicine pseudocyanide in a concentration-dependent manner with a maximal effect at 100 microM. However, arachidonic acid (AA)-induced thromboxane B2 and prostaglandin D2 formations were only partially suppressed by a high concentration of avicine pseudocyanide (300 microM). Avicine pseudocyanide (100 microM) inhibited the [3H]inositol monophosphate formation and the rise of intracellular Ca2+ concentration caused by collagen but not those caused by AA, U46619, platelet-activating factor and thrombin. In the presence of prostaglandin E1, Mg(2+)-dependent platelet adhesion to collagen was inhibited by avicine pseudocyanide with an IC50 of 278 +/- 16 microM. These data indicate that avicine pseudocyanide is an inhibitor of collagen-induced platelet aggregation and platelet-collagen adhesion.	trimeresurus mucrosquamatus avicine pseudocyanide
2	Algorithm for complementary and alternative medicine practice and research in type 2 diabetes.OBJECTIVE: To develop a model to direct the prescription of nutritional and botanical medicines in the treatment of type 2 diabetes for both clinical and research purposes. METHODS: Available literature on nutritional and botanical medicines was reviewed and categorized as follows: antioxidant/anti-inflammatory; insulin sensitizer; and beta-cell protectant/insulin secretagogue. Literature describing laboratory assessment for glycemic control, insulin resistance, and beta-cell reserve was also reviewed and a clinical decision tree was developed. RESULTS: Clinical algorithms were created to guide the use of nutritional and botanic medicines using validated laboratory measures of glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, and beta-cell reserve. Nutrient and botanic medicines with clinical trial research support include coenzyme Q10, carnitine, alpha-lipoic acid, N-acetylcysteine, vitamin D, vitamin C, vitamin E, chromium, vanadium, omega-3 fatty acids, cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia), fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum), and gymnema (Gymnema sylvestre). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical algorithms can direct supplementation in clinical practice and provide research models for clinical investigation. Algorithms also provide a framework for integration of future evidence as it becomes available. Research funding to investigate potentially beneficial practices in complementary medicine is critically important for optimal patient care and safety.	cinnamomum cassia diabetes

2	Abrin immunotoxin: targeted cytotoxicity and intracellular trafficking pathway.BACKGROUND: Immunotherapy is fast emerging as one of the leading modes of treatment of cancer, in combination with chemotherapy and radiation. Use of immunotoxins, proteins bearing a cell-surface receptor-specific antibody conjugated to a toxin, enhances the efficacy of cancer treatment. The toxin Abrin, isolated from the Abrus precatorius plant, is a type II ribosome inactivating protein, has a catalytic efficiency higher than any other toxin belonging to this class of proteins but has not been exploited much for use in targeted therapy. METHODS: Protein synthesis assay using (3)[H] L-leucine incorporation; construction and purification of immunotoxin; study of cell death using flow cytometry; confocal scanning microscopy and sub-cellular fractionation with immunoblot analysis of localization of proteins. RESULTS: We used the recombinant A chain of abrin to conjugate to antibodies raised against the human gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor. The conjugate inhibited protein synthesis and also induced cell death specifically in cells expressing the receptor. The conjugate exhibited differences in the kinetics of inhibition of protein synthesis, in comparison to abrin, and this was attributed to differences in internalization and trafficking of the conjugate within the cells. Moreover, observations of sequestration of the A chain into the nucleus of cells treated with abrin but not in cells treated with the conjugate reveal a novel pathway for the movement of the conjugate in the cells. CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first reports on nuclear localization of abrin, a type II RIP. The immunotoxin mAb F1G4-rABRa-A, generated in our laboratory, inhibits protein synthesis specifically on cells expressing the gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor and the pathway of internalization of the protein is distinct from that seen for abrin.	abrus precatorius cancer
2	Cinnamon: a multifaceted medicinal plant.Cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum, and Cinnamon cassia), the eternal tree of tropical medicine, belongs to the Lauraceae family. Cinnamon is one of the most important spices used daily by people all over the world. Cinnamon primarily contains vital oils and other derivatives, such as cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid, and cinnamate. In addition to being an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, anticancer, lipid-lowering, and cardiovascular-disease-lowering compound, cinnamon has also been reported to have activities against neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. This review illustrates the pharmacological prospective of cinnamon and its use in daily life. 	cinnamon alzheimer's diseases
2	An Arrow Poison (Abrus Precatorius) Causing Fatal Poisoning in a Child.Ingestion of whole seeds of Abrus precatorius often does not produce serious illness. It generally presents initially with gastrointestinal manifestations. Haemolysis, acute renal damage, hepatotoxicity and seizures are the other manifestations. Herewith we report a child with accidental ingestion of abrus precatorius seeds who presented with altered sensorium and convulsions. The case is being reported on account of its rarity in its initial neurological manifestation and has not been reported earlier in paediatric age group. 	abrus precatorius gastrointestinal
2	In vitro anti-Helicobacter pylori action of 30 Chinese herbal medicines used to treat ulcer diseases.Infection by Helicobacter pylori has been ascertained to be an important etiologic impetus leading usually to chronic active gastritis and gastric ulcer with growing incidences worldwide. Utilizing as the test pathogen a standard and five clinic strains of Helicobacter pylori, the antibacterial action was assessed in vitro with ethanol extracts of 30 Chinese herbal medicines which have been frequently prescribed since ancient times for treating gastritis-like disorders. Among the 30 tested materials, the ethanol extracts of Abrus cantoniensis (Fabaceae), Saussurea lappa (Asteraceae) and Eugenia caryophyllata (Myrtaceae) were strongly inhibitory to all test strains (MICs: approximately 40 microg/ml), and Hippophae rhamnoides (Elaeagnaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii (Liliaceae), Magnolia officinalis and Schisandra chinensis (Magnoliaceae), Corydalis yanhusuo (Papaveraceae), Citrus reticulata (Rutaceae), Bupleurum chinense and Ligusticum chuanxiong (Apiaceae) substantially active with MICs close to 60.0 microg/ml. As to antibacterial actions of the aqueous extracts of the same drugs, those derived from Cassia obtusifolia (Fabaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii and Eugenia caryophyllata were remarkably inhibitory against all the six Helicobacter pylori strains (MICs: approximately 60 microg/ml). The work compared almost quantitatively the magnitude of the anti-Helicobacter pylori actions of the 30 most prescribed gastritis-treating Chinese herbal drugs, and located as well some source plants where potent anti-Helicobacter pylori phytochemicals could be characterized.	bupleurum chinense gastric ulcer
2	Effects of native and heat-denatured Abrus agglutinin on tumor-associated macrophages in Dalton's lymphoma mice.Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have a complex and ambivalent relationship with tumor progression and elimination. Though TAMs are reported to have pro- and anti-tumor roles, upon modification and activation TAMs can develop tumoricidal activities and thus might have applications in cancer therapy. Various immunomodulatory compounds could be used to modulate TAMs. In this study we used Abrus agglutinin, a plant lectin, in its native and heat-denatured forms, to investigate its effect on TAMs in Dalton's lymphoma-bearing mice. We found that treatment with both native (NA) and heat-denatured agglutinin (HDA) activated the TAMs, which showed significantly increased in vitro cytotoxicity towards tumor cells and production of nitric oxide but no difference in TNF-alpha production. The tumoricidal activities of both NA and HDA were dependent upon the activation of TAMs as in macrophage-depleted Dalton's lymphoma-bearing mice NA and HDA treatment could not decrease the number of tumor cells significantly. Thus, NA and HDA could be used as modulators of TAMs, for their therapeutic use in cancer.	Abrus lymphoma
3	In vitro cytotoxic activity of isolated acridones alkaloids from Zanthoxylum leprieurii Guill. et Perr.Chemical investigation of the roots and fruits of Zanthoxylumleprieurii Guill. et Perr. led to the isolation of three new alkaloids including two acridone derivatives, 3-hydroxy-1,4-dimethoxy-10-methyl-9-acridone (2) and 3-hydroxy-1,2-dimethoxy-10-methyl-9-acridone (3) named helebelicine A and B, respectively, and one secobenzo[c]phenantridine, 10-O-demethyl-12-O-methylarnottianamide (10), together with thirteen other compounds. The structures of compounds 2, 3 and 10 as well as those of the known compounds were elucidated by using spectroscopic methods and by comparison with reported data. The brine-shrimp (artemia salina) lethality bioassay of the chloroform extract of the fruits showed modest cytotoxicity with LD(50) at 13.1microg/mL. Isolated compounds 1, 4-6 were found to be moderately active against lung carcinoma cells (A549), colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (DLD-1) and normal cells (WS1) with IC(50) values ranging from 27 to 77microM. In contrast to the positive control etoposide used, the cytotoxicity of the most active compound 4 was found to be selective against cancer cells in comparison to normal cells WS1 with IC(50) of 51+/-8microM and 4.3+/-0.4microM, respectively.	acridones alkaloids cancer
1	Effects of selected plant essential oils on the growth and development of mouse preimplantation embryos in vivo.Plant essential oils (EOs) have been reported to have health benefit properties and their preventive and therapeutic use in animals is expected to increase in the future. We evaluated the influence of five essential oils obtained from plant species which are known to have positive antimicrobial, antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects--sage EO from Salvia officinalis L. (Lamiaceae), oregano EO from Origanum vulgare L. (Lamiaceae), thyme EO from Thymus vulgaris L. (Lamiaceae), clove EO from Syzygium aromaticum L. (Myrtaceae) and cinnamon EO from Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume (Lauraceae) on the growth and development of mouse preimplantation embryos in vivo. Essential oils were added to commercial diet at concentrations of 0.25% for sage EO, thyme EO, clove EO, cinnamon EO and 0.1% for oregano EO, and fed to ICR female mice for 2 weeks ad libitum. Females were then mated with males of the same strain. Embryos obtained on Day 4 of pregnancy at the blastocyst stage were stained by morphological triple staining (Hoechst, PI, Calcein-AM) and evaluated using fluorescent microscopy. The effects of essential oils were estimated by the viability of embryos, number of nuclei and distribution of embryos according to nucleus number. Cinnamon EO significantly decreased the number of nuclei and the distribution of embryos according to nucleus number was significantly altered. Sage EO negatively influenced the distribution of embryos according to nucleus number. Clove and oregano EOs induced a significantly increased rate of cell death. Only thyme EO had no detectable effects on embryo development. In conclusion, none of the essential oils had any positive effect on embryo development, but some of them reduced the number of cells and increased the incidence of cell death.	oregano essential oils
1	Structure-activity relationship of benzophenanthridine alkaloids from Zanthoxylum rhoifolium having antimicrobial activity.Zanthoxylum rhoifolium (Rutaceae) is a plant alkaloid that grows in South America and has been used in Brazilian traditional medicine for the treatment of different health problems. The present study was designed to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the steam bark crude methanol extract, fractions, and pure alkaloids of Z. rhoifolium. Its stem bark extracts exhibited a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, ranging from 12.5 to 100 microg/mL using bioautography method, and from 125 to 500 microg/mL in the microdilution bioassay. From the dichloromethane basic fraction, three furoquinoline alkaloids (1-3), and nine benzophenanthridine alkaloids (4-12) were isolated and the antimicrobial activity of the benzophenanthridine alkaloids is discussed in terms of structure-activity relationships. The alkaloid with the widest spectrum of activity was chelerythrine (10), followed by avicine (12) and dihydrochelerythrine (4). The minimal inhibitory concentrations of chelerythrine, of 1.50 microg/mL for all bacteria tested, and between 3.12 and 6.25 microg/mL for the yeast tested, show this compound to be a more powerful antimicrobial agent when compared with the other active alkaloids isolated from Z. rhoifolium. To verify the potential importance of the methylenedioxy group (ring A) of these alkaloids, chelerythrine was selected to represent the remainder of the benzophenanthridine alkaloids isolated in this work and was subjected to a demethylation reaction giving derivative 14. Compared to chelerythrine, the derivative (14) was less active against the tested bacteria and fungi. Kinetic measurements of the bacteriolytic activities of chelerythrine against the bacteria Bacillus subtilis (Gram-positive) and Escherichia coli (Gram-negative) were determined by optical density based on real time assay, suggesting that its mechanism of action is not bacteriolytic. The present study did not detect hemolytic effects of chelerythrine on erythrocytes and found a protective effect considering the decrease in TBARS and AOPP (advanced oxidized protein products) levels when compared to the control group. 	z. rhoifolium benzophenanthridine alkaloids
3	Anti-Inflammatory Activities of Cinnamomum cassia Constituents In Vitro and In Vivo.We have investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of Cinnamomum cassia constituents (cinnamic aldehyde, cinnamic alcohol, cinnamic acid, and coumarin) using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated mouse macrophage (RAW264.7) and carrageenan (Carr)-induced mouse paw edema model. When RAW264.7 macrophages were treated with cinnamic aldehyde together with LPS, a significant concentration-dependent inhibition of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE(2)) levels productions were detected. Western blotting revealed that cinnamic aldehyde blocked protein expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), and IkappaBalpha, significantly. In the anti-inflammatory test, cinnamic aldehyde decreased the paw edema after Carr administration, and increased the activities of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in the paw tissue. We also demonstrated cinnamic aldehyde attenuated the malondialdehyde (MDA) level and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in the edema paw after Carr injection. Cinnamic aldehyde decreased the NO, TNF-alpha, and PGE(2) levels on the serum level after Carr injection. Western blotting revealed that cinnamic aldehyde decreased Carr-induced iNOS, COX-2, and NF-kappaB expressions in the edema paw. These findings demonstrated that cinnamic aldehyde has excellent anti-inflammatory activities and thus has great potential to be used as a source for natural health products.	cinnamic aldehyde edema
2	Antiplasmodial and cytotoxic activities of Rwandan medicinal plants used in the treatment of malaria.AIM OF THE STUDY: In our study, methanol, dichloromethane and aqueous extracts of 13 Rwandan medicinal plants used in the treatment of malaria were tested for in vitro antiplasmodial activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The growth inhibition of chloroquine-sensitive Plasmodium falciparum strain (3D7) was evaluated using the measurement of lactate dehydrogenase activity. The active extracts were also tested against the chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum strain (W2) and for cytotoxicity assay using human normal foetal lung fibroblasts (WI-38). RESULTS: The majority of the plants tested showed an antiplasmodial activity and the best results were observed with dichloromethane leaf and flower extracts of Tithonia diversifolia, leaf extract of Microglossa pyrifolia and root extract of Rumex abyssinicus, methanol leaf extract of Fuerstia africana, root bark extracts of Zanthoxylum chalybeum and methanol bark extract of Terminalia mollis. Those extracts were active (IC(50)&lt;15mug/ml) on both chloroquine-sensitive and resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum. Zanthoxylum chalybeum, Solanecio mannii and Terminalia mollis presented the best selectivity index. CONCLUSIONS: The traditional use of most of the plant evaluated was confirmed by the antiplasmodial test. This study revealed for the first time the antiplasmodial activity of two plants: Terminalia mollis and Rumex abyssinicus.	terminalia mollis malaria
1	Inhibitory effects of cinnamic acid on melanin biosynthesis in skin.Cinnamic acid is a wildly distributed phenylpropanoid component naturally occurring in plants, and is mainly found in Cinnamomum cassia BLUME and Panax ginseng. Cinnamic acid was recently reported to exert a tyrosinase inhibitory effect. However, research on melanocytes and animal bodies was not reported until now. In this study, we examined the effects of cinnamic acid on melanin biosynthesis within the melanocytes and brown guinea pigs. Melan-a cells were used to examine the effects of cinnamic acid in the melanocytes. Treatment with 100 ppm of cinnamic acid resulted in a significant reduction of melanin production in the melan-a cells at 29.0%. This compound also exhibited a potent inhibitory effect on tyrosinase activity and reduced tyrosinase expression in the melan-a cells. Moreover, cinnamic acid exhibited depigmenting activity on the UV-B-induced hyperpigmentation of brown guinea pig skin. Our results suggest that cinnamic acid might act as a skin whitening agent via inhibition of tyrosinase activity and expression within melanocytes.	cinnamomum cassia cinnamic acid
3	Treatment of chronic kidney disease using a traditional Chinese medicine, Flos Abelmoschus manihot (Linnaeus) Medicus (Malvaceae).The flowers of Abelmoschus manihot (Linnaeus) Medicus (Malvaceae; Flos A. manihot) have been used in China for many centuries as a traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of chronic kidney disease. The Huangkui capsule is a single-plant drug extracted from the dry corolla of Flos A. manihot that has been approved by China's State Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of chronic glomerulonephritis. The purpose of this paper is to review briefly some of the past experiences in rapid filtration and to present more fully a few facts brought out in recent studies. The primary chemical constituents of Flos A. manihot are flavonoids. In vivo, the flavonoids can be transformed into glucuronide-sulphate conjugates, which are the major metabolites of Flos A. manihot and could contribute to the renoprotective effects in vivo. Flos A. manihot can ameliorate proteinuria, podocyte apoptosis, glomerulosclerosis and mesangial proliferation. The renoprotective effects of Flos A. manihot are related to inhibition of caspase-3 and caspase-8 overexpression, reduction of the infiltration of ED1(+) and ED3(+) macrophages, downregulation of oxidative stress, inhibition of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and serine/threonine kinase pathways and suppression of transforming growth factor-beta1 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha expression. Recently, a multicentre randomized controlled trial demonstrated that Flos A. manihot was more effective than the angiotensin-receptor blocker losartan in reducing proteinuria in patients with primary glomerular disease. Because Flos A. manihot is generally preferred by Chinese patients and clinicians, high-quality trials to test the efficacy and safety of Flos A. manihot are urgently needed.	flavonoids glomerulosclerosis
3	Acute demyelinating encephalitis after jequirity pea ingestion (Abrus precatorius).INTRODUCTION: Castor and jequirity beans are uncommon causes of poisoning. The more common but less severe castor poisoning is well described, but jequirity bean (Abrus Precatorius) poisoning is rare. The toxicity is attributed to toxalbumins (ricin and abrin) that act by inhibiting protein synthesis. Their use as agents of biological warfare, mechanisms of action, and clinical features of poisoning are summarized. CASE REPORT: A 30-year-old previously healthy female presented with bloody diarrhea and deep coma following ingestion of 3-4 seeds of a plant called 'ratti.' Investigations, including an MRI brain scan, showed evidence of acute demyelinating encephalitis. The patient died three days later due to progressive central nervous system depression. DISCUSSION: This is a previously unreported manifestation of jequirity bean poisoning. Demyelination is immune-mediated, and Abrus is a well-known immuno-modulator and stimulator. A possible immunological pathogenic mechanism is hypothesized.	toxalbumins Demyelination
3	Anthelmintic properties of alpha-sanshool from Zanthoxylum liebmannianum.The decoction of the stem bark of Zanthoxylum liebmannianum (Engelm.) P. Wilson (Rutaceae) decreased the count of intestinal nematode eggs in naturally infected sheep. In addition, the chloroformic extract was toxic to Ascaris suum. Fractionation of the organic extract guided by the Ascaris suum lethality test led to the isolation of alpha-sanshool (LC50 = 83.4 x 10(-5)M) as the only active compound. On the other hand, alpha-sanshool induced tonic-clonic seizures when it was injected intraperitoneally to mice. This finding could be a warning regarding the potential toxicity of this plant.	alpha-sanshool toxicity
1	Seasonal variation in the leaf essential oil composition of Zanthoxylum clava-herculis growing in Huntsville, Alabama.The seasonal variation in the chemical composition of the leaf essential oil of Zanthoxylum clava-herculis has been analyzed by GC-MS. Three individual trees were sampled four times during the course of the 2004 growing season. Notable differences were recorded in the essential oil yields from the three trees on the four collection dates; yields were highest in May and lowest in July. The leaf essential oils were made up of 25 components, largely menthane monoterpenoids, dominated by limonene (44-73%) and 1,8-cineole (16-43%), with lesser amounts of alpha-thujene, linalool, gamma-terpinene, and alpha-terpineol. The ratio of oxygenated monoterpenoids to monoterpene hydrocarbons generally increased during the season, largely reflected in the 1,8-cineole/limonene ratio.	zanthoxylum clava-herculis monoterpenoids
1	Optimization of green extraction methods for cinnamic acid and cinnamaldehyde from Cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia) by response surface methodology.The major compounds of cinnamon are cinnamic acid and cinnamaldehyde, for which the conditions of microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE), and reflux extraction (RE) were optimized using response surface methodology for comparing their efficiencies in terms of extraction yield, consumption of time and energy, and CO2 emission. The results indicated MAE superiority to UAE and RE owing to the highest yield of target compounds (total yield: 0.89%, cinnamic acid: 6.48 mg/100 mL, and cinnamaldehyde: 244.45 mg/100 mL) at optimum MAE conditions: 59% ethanol, 147.5 W microwave power and 3.4 min of extraction time. RE resulted in comparable yields with the highest consumption of time, energy, and solvent, and least CO2 emission. Therefore, it is concluded that MAE is the most efficient method for green extraction of cinnamic acid and cinnamaldehyde from cinnamon powder compared to UAE and RE.	cinnamomum cassia cinnamaldehyde
2	Hypoglycemic effects of three Iranian edible plants; jujube, barberry and saffron: Correlation with serum adiponectin level.One of the most common disorders of the endocrine system is diabetes mellitus. This disease is associated with dyslipidemia. Adiponectin is a protein hormone that secreted by adipocytes and has an important role in regulating of glucose and fatty acid metabolic pathways. This study was designed to investigate the changes in serum level of adiponectin in diabetic rats treated with hydroalcoholic extracts of three medicinal plants; jujube (Ziziphus jujuba), barberry (Berberis vulgaris) and saffron (Crocus sativus) in comparison with quercetin. Streptozotocin -induced diabetic male rats were gavaged with specified doses of the extracts (25 and 100mg/kg) for two weeks. At the end of treatment period, fasting blood specimens were collected. The levels of adiponectin, fasting blood sugar (FBS), total Cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-C and LDL-C were measured. Statistical analysis showed that serum levels of triglyceride and VLDL decreased significantly (P&lt;0.05) in all treated groups. FBS level in all treated groups, decreased significantly and reach to normoglycemic level (P&lt;0.05). Except Jujube, other plant extracts had no effect on cholesterol. Jujube in two doses (25 and 100mg/kg) could increased significantly HDL-C (P&lt;0.05) with no effect on total cholesterol and LDL-C. Serum adiponectin level increased in all treated groups. These beneficial effects of C. sativus, B. vulgaris and Z. jujube extracts and quercetin in diabetic rats may be associated with increase in adiponectin level. 	b. vulgaris diabetic
1	Zanthoxylum ailanthoides Sieb and Zucc. extract inhibits growth and induces cell death through G2/M-phase arrest and activation of apoptotic signals in colo 205 human colon adenocarcinoma cells.The effects of 50% ethanolic stem extracts of Zanthoxylum ailanthoides Sieb and Zucc. (ZASZ) on the cell viability, cell cycle and apoptosis were investigated in a human colon adenocarcinoma cell line (colo 205). The results demonstrated that ZASZ induced morphological changes and decreased the cell viability. ZASZ promoted Wee1, checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2), p21 and p53 levels, decreased cyclin B and cdc25c associated with that led to G(2)/M phase arrest. ZASZ-triggered apoptosis was confirmed by 4' -6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining and DNA gel electrophoresis. ZASZ increased the levels of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and growth arrest and DNA damage inducible gene 153 (GADD153), and promoted an increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca(2+) release, and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) accompanied by cytochrome c release that was due to the decrease of Bcl-2 and increase of Bax levels in the colo 205 cells. ZASZ also induced the protein levels of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and endonuclease G (Endo G), increased the levels of caspase-3, -7 and -9, and stimulated the levels of fatty acid synthase (Fas) and Fas ligand in the colo 205 cells. ZASZ contains phenolic compounds, including flavone, chlorogenic acid and isofraxidin, among which, flavone was found to be the most effective in reducing cell viability and proliferative responses in the colo 205 cells. ZASZ induces cytotoxicity and apoptosis in colo 205 cells which provides the rationale for studies in animal models on the utilization of ZASZ as a potential cancer therapeutic compound.	zanthoxylum ailanthoides isofraxidin
1	Structural characterization of polysaccharides from Zizyphus jujuba and evaluation of antioxidant activity.Fruit of Zizyphus jujuba Mill, a traditional Chinese herb widely consumed in Asian countries, has been reported to possess several vital biological activities. This study intends to develop an appropriate analytical method for isolation of polysaccharides from Z. jujuba fruits and evaluate their antioxidant activity. Initially, powdered Z. jujuba fruits were subjected to hot water extraction, followed by ethanol precipitation, deproteination, dialysis and fractionation in a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column. One neutral polysaccharide fraction (ZJPN) and 3 acidic polysaccharide fractions (ZJPa1, ZJPa2 and ZJPa3) were isolated with the average MW ranging from 40,566 to 129,518 Da. GC analysis revealed that 6 monosaccharides, namely, rhamnose, arabinose, xylose, mannose, glucose and galactose were present in polysaccharide fractions. The galacturonic acid content in polysaccharide fractions followed the order: ZJPa3&gt;ZJPa2&gt;ZJPa1&gt;ZJPN. All the 4 polysaccharide fractions were found to be more effective in scavenging superoxide anions than hydroxyl radicals, while acidic polysaccharides showed a more pronounced effect in chelating ferrous ion.	z. jujuba xylose
1	The role of xylem class III peroxidases in lignification.Lignification is a cell wall fortifying process which occurs in xylem tissue in a scheduled manner during tissue differentiation. In this review, enzymes and the genes responsible for lignin biosynthesis have been studied with an emphasis on lignin polymerizing class III secretable plant peroxidases. Our aim is to understand the cell and molecular biology of the polymerization of lignin especially in tracheids and vessels of woody species but much of the experimental evidence comes from herbaceous plants. Class III peroxidases pose many problems for empirical work as their encoding genes are variable, their substrate specificities are wide and the half-life of many of the isozymes is very long. However, there is some evidence for the role of specific peroxidases in lignin polymerization through antisense mutants in tobacco and poplar and from tissue and cell culture lines of Picea abies and Zinnia elegans. Peroxidase enzyme action has been shown by substrate specificity studies and, for example, RT-PCR results have pointed out that many peroxidases have tissue-specific expression patterns. Tissue-level location of gene expression of some peroxidases has been studied by in situ hybridization and their cellular localization with antibodies and using EGFP-fusion genes. From these, it can be concluded that, although many of the xylem class III peroxidases have the potential for functioning in the synthesis of the lignin polymer, the combined information of catalytic properties, expression, and localization can reveal differences in the significance of different peroxidases in the lignification process.	zinnia elegans lignin
1	Phytochemical and biological activities of four wild medicinal plants.The fruits of four wild plants, namely, Capparis decidua, Ficus carica, Syzygium cumini, and Ziziphus jujuba, are separately used as traditional dietary and remedial agents in remote areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. The results of our study on these four plants revealed that the examined fruits were a valuable source of nutraceuticals and exhibited good level of antimicrobial activity. The fruits of these four investigated plants are promising source of polyphenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, and saponins. These four plants' fruits are good sources of iron, zinc, copper, manganese, selenium, and chromium. It was also observed that these fruits are potential source of antioxidant agent and the possible reason could be that these samples had good amount of phytochemicals. Hence, the proper propagation, conservation, and chemical investigation are recommended so that these fruits should be incorporated for the eradication of food and health related problems. 	capparis decidua alkaloids
1	2-hydroxycinnamaldehyde inhibits SW620 colon cancer cell growth through AP-1 inactivation.Cinnamaldehyde derivatives isolated from Cinnamomum cassia have been widely used for treating dyspepsia, gastritis, and inflammatory disease as well as cancer. To investigate the anti-tumor activities of several cinnamaldehyde derivatives, we compared the inhibitory effect of cinnamaldehyde derivatives on cell growth and AP-1 transcriptional activity in SW620 human colon cancer cells since AP-1 is a transcriptional factor implicated to control cancer cell growth. Among the derivatives, 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (HCA) most significantly inhibited cancer cell growth and AP-1 transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 12.5 and 9 microg/ml, respectively. In further studies on the mechanism, we found that consistent with the inhibitory effect on cell growth, HCA dose-dependently (0-20 microg/ml) inhibited DNA binding activity of AP-1 accompanied with down regulation of c-Jun and c-Fos expressions. HCA also induced apoptotic cell death as well as expression of the apoptosis-regulating gene caspase-3, but inhibited the anti-apoptosis regulating gene bcl-2 in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggested that HCA has the most potent inhibitory effect against human colon cancer cell growth, and AP-1 may be an important target of HCA.	cinnamomum cassia cinnamaldehyde
4	Abrus Agglutinin, a type II ribosome inactivating protein inhibits Akt/PH domain to induce endoplasmic reticulum stress mediated autophagy-dependent cell death.Abrus agglutinin (AGG), a type II ribosome-inactivating protein has been found to induce mitochondrial apoptosis. In the present study, we documented that AGG-mediated Akt dephosphorylation led to ER stress resulting the induction of autophagy-dependent cell death through the canonical pathway in cervical cancer cells. Inhibition of autophagic death with 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and siRNA of Beclin-1 and ATG5 increased AGG-induced apoptosis. Further, inhibiting apoptosis by Z-DEVD-FMK and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) increased autophagic cell death after AGG treatment, suggesting that AGG simultaneously induced autophagic and apoptotic death in HeLa cells. Additionally, it observed that AGG-induced autophagic cell death in Bax knock down (Bax-KD) and 5-FU resistant HeLa cells, confirming as an alternate cell killing pathway to apoptosis. At the molecular level, AGG-induced ER stress in PERK dependent pathway and inhibition of ER stress by salubrinal, eIF2alpha phosphatase inhibitor as well as siPERK reduced autophagic death in the presence of AGG. Further, our in silico and colocalization study showed that AGG interacted with pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Akt to suppress its phosphorylation and consequent downstream mTOR dephosphorylation in HeLa cells. We showed that Akt overexpression could not augment GRP78 expression and reduced autophagic cell death by AGG as compared to pcDNA control, indicating Akt modulation was the upstream signal during AGG's ER stress mediated autophagic cell death. In conclusion, we established that AGG stimulated cell death by autophagy might be used as an alternative tumor suppressor mechanism in human cervical cancer.   2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

1	Plants traditionally prescribed to treat tazo (malaria) in the eastern region of Madagascar.BACKGROUND: Malaria is known as tazo or tazomoka in local terminology in Madagascar. Within the context of traditional practice, malaria (and/or malaria symptoms) is commonly treated by decoctions or infusions from bitter plants. One possible approach to the identification of new antimalarial drug candidates is to search for compounds that cure or prevent malaria in plants empirically used to treat malaria. Thus, it is worth documenting the ethnobotanical data, and testing the antiplasmodial activity of the extractive from plants. METHODS: We interviewed traditional healers, known locally as ombiasy, at Andasibe in the eastern, rainy part of Madagascar. We recorded details of the preparation and use of plants for medicinal purposes. We extracted five alkaloids from Z. tsihanimposa stem bark, and tested them in vitro against Plasmodium falciparum FCM29. RESULTS: We found that traditional healers treat malaria with herbal remedies consisting of one to eight different plants. We identified and listed the medicinal plants commonly used to treat malaria. The plants used included a large number of species from different families. Zanthoxylum sp (Rutaceae) was frequently cited, and plants from this genus are also used to treat malaria in other parts of Madagascar. From the plant list, Zanthoxylum tsihanimposa, bitter plant endemic to Madagascar, was selected and examined. Five alkaloids were isolates from the stem bark of this plant, and tested in vitro against malaria parasite. The geometric mean IC50 values ranged from 98.4 to 332.1 micromolar. The quinoline alkaloid gamma-fagarine exhibited the strongest antiplasmodial activity. CONCLUSIONS: The current use of plants for medicinal purposes reflects the attachment of the Malagasy people to their culture, and also a lack of access to modern medicine. The possible extrapolation of these in vitro findings, obtained with plant extracts, to the treatment of malaria and/or the signs evoking malaria is still unclear. If plants are to be used as sources of novel antimalarial compounds, we need to increase our knowledge of their empirical use to improve plant selection. In the hope of preserving useful resources, we should now gather and record ethnobotanical data in Madagascar, and should try to bridge the gaps between empirics and realism.	plasmodium falciparum alkaloids
1	Essential oil from Zanthoxylum tingoassuiba loaded into multilamellar liposomes useful as antimicrobial agents.Zanthoxylum tingoassuiba essential oil (EO) is a complex mixture of organic compounds among which methyl-N-methylanthranilate and sesquiterpene alcohol alpha-bisabolol represent the main compounds. The essential oil antimicrobial activity was studied against bacteria and fungi cells by diffusion disk method and significant activity was observed against S. aureus, S. aureus isolated multi-resistant and the dermathophyte fungi. Essential oil from Zanthoxylum tingoassuiba loaded into DPPC multilamellar liposomes (MLV) was successfully produced through a thin film hydration method with mean diameter of 9.37 +/- 4.69 microm. The EO-loaded liposomes showed adequate sphericity and narrower size distribution than empty liposomes. Results also showed that Zanthoxylum tingoassuiba essential oil can be incorporated in appreciable amounts (43.7 +/- 6.0%) in the prepared vesicular dispersions. A strong interaction between essential oil and lipid bilayer was indicated by a significant decrease in T(m) of the EO-loaded liposomes related to empty vesicles. Essential oil showed incomplete release profile from liposomes, suggesting that EO-loaded liposomes will be useful in pharmaceutical applications to enhance essential oil targeting to cells.	zanthoxylum tingoassuiba alpha-bisabolol
1	Pharmacognostic and phytochemical studies of Zanthoxylum armatum DC.The pharmacognostic and phytochemical investigations on the leaf, stem bark, and fruit of Zanthoxylum armatum were carried out. Macroscopic study of leaf, stem bark, and fruit of Z. armatum revealed some of the characteristic features like size, shape, color, odor and taste of the crude drug. Distinguishing fragments were identified from the powder drug. Leaf, bark, and fruit powder of this plant have higher values of total, acid insoluble, and water soluble ash as compared to the powder of this plant exhausted with ethanol and n- hexane. Extraction values in methanol were highest for leaves (20.10%) and fruit (11%), while bark showed highest value in chloroform (8.5%). The extractive values varied among other parts with different solvents. Fluorescence analysis of the Z. Armatum leaf, stem bark, and fruit powder with various reagents showed characteristic coloration at day and under UV light. Quantitative phytochemical screening revealed the presence of many bioactive constituents in leaves, such as alkaloids (15.60+-0.10 mg/g), sterols (71.60+-0.10mg/g), saponins (21.57+-0.12mg/g), tannins (34.43+-0.21mg/g), phenols (11.66+-0.33mg/g) and flavonoids (13.68+-0.66mg/g). Alkaloids (19.60+-0.10mg/g), sterols (33.83+-0.29mg/g), saponins (14.78+-0.10mg/g), tannins (28.62+-0.13mg/g), phenols (16.48+-1.33mg/g) and flavonoids (18.33+-1.22mg/g) were reported form the bark, while fruits were reported to have alkaloids (25.07+-0.21mg/g), sterols (164.92+-0.14mg/g), saponins (28.60+-0.10mg/g), tannins (35.5+-0.5mg/g), phenols (21.68+-0.44mg/g) and flavonoids (22.8+-1.33mg/g). Z. armatum is an important medicinal plant, traditionally used for various ailments. This study will be helpful in the future pharmacognostic standardization of this important plant.	z. armatum saponins

1	In vitro efficacy of 75 essential oils against Aspergillus niger.Aspergillus niger is an opportunistic human pathogen and a strong air pollutant. A study was conducted with 75 different essential oils for the inhibition of hyphal growth and spore formation in Aspergillus niger. Cinnamomum zeylanicum (bark), Cinnamomum zeylanicum (leaf), Cinnamomum cassia, Syzygium aromaticum and Cymbopogon citratus were the top five essential oils which demonstrated marked inhibitory effect against hyphal growth and spore formation of A. niger. The chemical composition of these five most active essential oils was investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectra (GC-MS). Most of the other essential oils were found challenging to combat A. niger, suggesting their use as strong aroma therapeutic agents.	cinnamomum zeylanicum essential oils
4	Anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory properties of Zizyphus mauritiana root bark.An allergy may sometimes be very dangerous and one of the main factors responsible for allergy is the complement system which can lead to a life-threatening reaction called anaphylaxis. Cycloxygenase-1 (COX-1), Cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2) and 5-Lipoxygenase (5-LOX) trigger allergic and inflammatory reactions. A number of anti-allergic synthetic drugs are available but are costly and show many side effects. Hence, the ancient traditional system of medication mentioned in Ayurveda finds an edge over various synthetic drugs. Zizyphus mauritiana is referred to as the store house of phytochemicals in Ayurveda. The stem and root barks of Zizyphus mauritiana were dried and powdered under controlled conditions. Extractions of the dried powders were performed separately in different solvents in increasing order of their polarity and were tested for their ability to inhibit the complement system. The aqueous extract of the root bark was found to be more effective in inhibiting the complement system. Fractionation of the aqueous extract resulted in the isolation of the Most Active Fraction (MAF) which inhibited the complement system, COX-1, COX-2, and 5-LOX with IC50 values of 0.006 mug ml(-1), 0.065 mug ml(-1), 0.008 mug ml(-1), and 0.083 mug ml(-1), respectively. The MAF was proven to be successful in down-regulating pro-inflammatory mediators like TNF-alpha, COX-2, and iNOS when tested on a RAW 264.7 cell line. In vivo, the MAF was found to be preventive against anaphylactic shock and the Arthus reaction, when orally administered daily to Wistar rats. Phytochemical analysis of the MAF has indicated that it is rich in tannins. Results indicate that the MAF, a fraction isolated from the aqueous extract of the root bark of Zizyphus mauritiana, has potent anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory properties. 	COX-2 allergy
1	Cytotoxicity of benzophenanthridine alkaloids from the roots of Zanthoxylum nitidum (Roxb.) DC. var. fastuosum How ex Huang.This work aimed to investigate benzophenanthridine from the roots of Zanthoxylum nitidum (Roxb.) DC. var. fastuosum How ex Huang for the first time. Thirteen benzophenanthridines were isolated, and our results of the cytotoxic activities indicated that compound 6 exhibited the best potency against A549, Hela, SMMC-7721 and EJ, with the IC50 values of 27.50, 37.50, 16.95 and 60.42 muM, respectively. Compounds 7 and 11 also showed strong cytotoxicity when tested against the four human cancer cell lines (A549, Hela, SMMC-7721 and EJ), while only compounds 12 and 13 displayed cytotoxicity in inhibiting BALL-1 proliferation among all the compounds. These results suggested that benzophenanthridines may become a valid alternative of potential basis for new anti-proliferative agents.	zanthoxylum nitidum (roxb.) dc. var benzophenanthridines
1	The Use of Essential Oils and Their Isolated Compounds for the Treatment of Oral Candidiasis: A Literature Review.In this literature review, we present the main scientific findings on the antifungal activity of essential oils (EOs) applicable for a new drug formulation to treat oral candidiasis. Seven literature databases were systematically searched for eligible in vitro and clinical trials. Selected articles were screened for biological activity, botanical species, phytochemical composition, study design, and methodological quality. A total of 26 articles were included in the review, of which 21 were in vitro studies and 5 clinical trials. The most promising EOs were obtained from Allium tubeorosum, Cinnamomum cassia, Cinnamomum zeylanicum, and Coriandrum sativum L. Among the phytochemicals, citral and thymol were the most active. Clinical trials indicated that the EOs from Pelargonium graveolens and Zataria multiflora are potentially effective to treat oral candidiasis. Further nonclinical and clinical studies with these EO are warranted to determine their potential use and safety for the treatment of oral candidiasis.	cinnamomum zeylanicum EOs
2	Cinnamon supplementation does not improve glycemic control in postmenopausal type 2 diabetes patients.In vitro and in vivo animal studies have reported strong insulin-like or insulin-potentiating effects after cinnamon administration. Recently, a human intervention study showed that cinnamon supplementation (1 g/d) strongly reduced fasting blood glucose concentration (30%) and improved the blood lipid profile in patients with type 2 diabetes. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of cinnamon supplementation on insulin sensitivity and/or glucose tolerance and blood lipid profile in patients with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, a total of 25 postmenopausal patients with type 2 diabetes (aged 62.9 +/- 1.5 y, BMI 30.4 +/- 0.9 kg/m2) participated in a 6-wk intervention during which they were supplemented with either cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia, 1.5 g/d) or a placebo. Before and after 2 and 6 wk of supplementation, arterialized blood samples were obtained and oral glucose tolerance tests were performed. Blood lipid profiles and multiple indices of whole-body insulin sensitivity were determined. There were no time x treatment interactions for whole-body insulin sensitivity or oral glucose tolerance. The blood lipid profile of fasting subjects did not change after cinnamon supplementation. We conclude that cinnamon supplementation (1.5 g/d) does not improve whole-body insulin sensitivity or oral glucose tolerance and does not modulate blood lipid profile in postmenopausal patients with type 2 diabetes. More research on the proposed health benefits of cinnamon supplementation is warranted before health claims should be made.	cinnamomum cassia type 2 diabetes
3	Antiparasitic and antimicrobial isoflavanquinones from Abrus schimperi.The EtOH extract of Abrus schimperi (Fabaceae), collected in Kenya, demonstrated significant activity against Leishmania donovani promastigotes with IC50 value of 3.6 microg/mL. Bioassay-guided fractionation of CHCl3 fraction using Centrifugal Preparative TLC afforded two antiparasitic isoflavanquinones, namely amorphaquinone (1) and pendulone (2). They displayed IC50 values of 0.63 microg/mL and 0.43 microg/mL, respectively, against L. donovani promastigotes. Both the compounds were also evaluated against L. donovani axenic amastigotes and amastigotes in THPI macrophage cultures. In addition, compounds 1 and 2 showed antiplasmodial activity against Plasmodium falciparum D6 and W2 strains, while 2 displayed antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (each IC50 1.44 microg/mL). The 1H and 13C data of 1, not fully assigned previously, were unambiguously assigned using 1D and 2D NMR HMBC and HMQC experiments. In addition, the absolute stereochemistry of the isolated compounds 1 and 2 was revised as C-(3S) based on Circular Dichroism experiments. This appears to be the first report of amorphaquinone (1) and pendulone (2) from the genus Abrus.	isoflavanquinones leishmania donovani promastigotes
3	Inhibition of collagen-induced platelet aggregation and adhesion by a pseudocyanide derivative of avicine isolated from Zanthoxylum integrifoliolum Merr.Avicine pseudocyanide, a derivative of avicine isolated from Zanthoxylum integrifoliolum Merr., inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation and release reaction in a concentration-dependent manner. Trimucytin is a collagen-like snake venom protein isolated from Trimeresurus mucrosquamatus. Avicine pseudocyanide also inhibited trimucytin (1 microgram/mL)-induced platelet aggregation and release reaction concentration dependently. The IC50 values of avicine pseudocyanide on collagen (10 micrograms/mL)- and trimucytin (1 microgram/mL)-induced platelet aggregation were 47.3 +/- 4.1 and 62.5 +/- 5.6 microM, respectively. Avicine pseudocyanide at a concentration of 300 microM inhibited less than 30% of platelet aggregation induced by ADP (20 microM), AA (100 microM), U46619 (1 microM), PAF (2 ng/mL) and thrombin (0.1 U/mL). The concentration-response curve of collagen-induced platelet aggregation was shifted to the right by avicine pseudocyanide (20-100 microM) concentration dependently. The Schild plot showed that pA2 and pA10 values of avicine pseudocyanide were 4.8 and 4.3, respectively, with slope of -1.9. Avicine pseudocyanide also inhibited collagen (10 micrograms/mL)-induced aggregation of rabbit whole blood with an IC50 of 145 +/- 13 microM. Collagen-induced thromboxane B2 formation was also inhibited by avicine pseudocyanide in a concentration-dependent manner with a maximal effect at 100 microM. However, arachidonic acid (AA)-induced thromboxane B2 and prostaglandin D2 formations were only partially suppressed by a high concentration of avicine pseudocyanide (300 microM). Avicine pseudocyanide (100 microM) inhibited the [3H]inositol monophosphate formation and the rise of intracellular Ca2+ concentration caused by collagen but not those caused by AA, U46619, platelet-activating factor and thrombin. In the presence of prostaglandin E1, Mg(2+)-dependent platelet adhesion to collagen was inhibited by avicine pseudocyanide with an IC50 of 278 +/- 16 microM. These data indicate that avicine pseudocyanide is an inhibitor of collagen-induced platelet aggregation and platelet-collagen adhesion.	avicine pseudocyanide platelet aggregation
2	Profiling of the compounds absorbed in human plasma and urine after oral administration of a traditional Japanese (kampo) medicine, daikenchuto.Daikenchuto (DKT), a pharmaceutical-grade traditional Japanese (Kampo) medicine, has been widely used for the treatment of various gastrointestinal disorders including postoperative ileus and has been integrated into the modern medical care system in Japan as a prescription drug. DKT is a multiherbal medicine consisting of Japanese pepper (zanthoxylum fruit), processed ginger, and ginseng with maltose as an additive. Despite substantial research on the pharmacological activities of DKT and its ingredients, the lack of studies on absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of DKT has made it difficult to obtain a consistent picture of its mechanism of action. In the present study, we constructed an analysis procedure consisting of seven conditions of liquid chromatography and mass spectrometric analysis, which enabled the identification of 44 ingredients of DKT component herbs. We investigated the plasma and urine profiles of these ingredients 0.5 to 8 h after oral administration of 15.0 g of DKT in four healthy volunteers. The results indicated that 1) hydroxy-alpha-sanshool and [6]-shogaol, the prominent peaks in plasma derived from Japanese pepper and ginger, respectively, were detected at 0.5 h and thereafter decreased throughout the sampling period; 2) ginsenoside Rb(1), a prominent peak derived from ginseng, increased gradually during the sampling period; 3) glucuronide conjugates of hydroxy-sanshools, shogaols, and gingerols were detected in plasma and urine; and 4) no obvious differences between samples from the two male and the two female individuals were observed. These results provide a strong basis for future studies on pharmacokinetics and pharmacology of DKT.	ginseng gastrointestinal disorders
1	Divalent later transition metal complexes of the traditional chinese medicine (TCM) liriodenine: coordination chemistry, cytotoxicity and DNA binding studies.Liriodenine (L), a natural alkaloid, was isolated as an active component from the anticancer traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Zanthoxylum nitidum. It reacted with Mn(II), Fe(II), Co(II) and Zn(II) to afford four metal complexes: [MnCl(2)(L)(2)] (1), [FeCl(2)(L)(2)] (2), [Co(L)(2)(H(2)O)(2).Co(L)(2)(CH(3)CH(2)OH)(2)](ClO(4))(4) (3), and [Zn(2)(L)(2)(mu(2)-Cl)(2)Cl(2)] (4), which were characterized by elemental analysis, IR, ESI-MS. Their crystal structures were determined by the single crystal X-ray diffraction method. The in vitro cytotoxicity of L and complexes 1-4 against 10 human tumour cell lines was assayed. Some of these metal-based compounds exhibited enhanced cytotoxicity vs. free L to selected tumour cell lines. The binding properties of L and its complexes 1-4 to ct-DNA were investigated by spectroscopic methods and viscosity measurements. Agarose gel electrophoresis experiments were also carried out to evaluate their unwinding ability towards plasmid DNA and their inhibition towards Topoisomerase I. All the results indicate that complexes 1-4 may bind more intensively to the DNA helix than does L, and intercalative binding for complexes 1-4 and electrostatic interactions for complexes 3-4 to DNA should be considered. For complex 4, covalent binding to DNA may exist. Of special note, all these metal complexes effectively inhibit Topoisomerase I even at low concentration (&lt; or = 10 microM).	zanthoxylum nitidum Liriodenine
2	Possible attenuation of nitric oxide expression in anti-inflammatory effect of Ziziphus jujuba in rat.The hydroalcoholic extract of fruits of Ziziphus jujuba (ZJ) was investigated for its anti-inflammatory effect using acute and chronic models of inflammation in rat. Wistar albino rats of either sex were employed in the present study (n = 6). Acute inflammation was induced by subplantar administration of carrageenan (1%) in rat hind paw. Chronic inflammation was induced by interscapular implantation of a sterile cotton pellet (50 mg). ZJ extract as test drug and indomethacin (10 mg/kg) as standard were used. Serum nitrite/nitrate was also estimated to determine the expression of nitric oxide. In the acute study, carrageenan (1%) administration caused marked paw edema. Pretreatment with ZJ extract exhibited marked dose-dependent attenuation in edema compared to control. In the chronic study, interscapular implantation of sterile cotton pellets caused significant granuloma formation after 7 days, serving as control. ZJ extract significantly decreased granuloma tissue formation compared to control. The serum nitrite/nitrate level was significantly increased after 7 days in the control group due to chronic inflammation, but was decreased by ZJ extract. Moreover, phytochemical studies indicated the presence of jujubosides, flavonoids and terpenes, which may produce the marked anti-inflammatory effect of ZJ fruit in acute and chronic inflammation, possibly by inhibiting nitric oxide expression. The study provides a scientific and ethnopharmacological rationale for the therapeutic use of ZJ fruit as an anti-inflammatory agent.	ziziphus jujuba edema
1	Effects of selected plant essential oils on the growth and development of mouse preimplantation embryos in vivo.Plant essential oils (EOs) have been reported to have health benefit properties and their preventive and therapeutic use in animals is expected to increase in the future. We evaluated the influence of five essential oils obtained from plant species which are known to have positive antimicrobial, antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects--sage EO from Salvia officinalis L. (Lamiaceae), oregano EO from Origanum vulgare L. (Lamiaceae), thyme EO from Thymus vulgaris L. (Lamiaceae), clove EO from Syzygium aromaticum L. (Myrtaceae) and cinnamon EO from Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume (Lauraceae) on the growth and development of mouse preimplantation embryos in vivo. Essential oils were added to commercial diet at concentrations of 0.25% for sage EO, thyme EO, clove EO, cinnamon EO and 0.1% for oregano EO, and fed to ICR female mice for 2 weeks ad libitum. Females were then mated with males of the same strain. Embryos obtained on Day 4 of pregnancy at the blastocyst stage were stained by morphological triple staining (Hoechst, PI, Calcein-AM) and evaluated using fluorescent microscopy. The effects of essential oils were estimated by the viability of embryos, number of nuclei and distribution of embryos according to nucleus number. Cinnamon EO significantly decreased the number of nuclei and the distribution of embryos according to nucleus number was significantly altered. Sage EO negatively influenced the distribution of embryos according to nucleus number. Clove and oregano EOs induced a significantly increased rate of cell death. Only thyme EO had no detectable effects on embryo development. In conclusion, none of the essential oils had any positive effect on embryo development, but some of them reduced the number of cells and increased the incidence of cell death.	oregano essential oils
1	Kaikasaponin III and soyasaponin I, major triterpene saponins of Abrus cantoniensis, act on GOT and GPT: influence on transaminase elevation of rat liver cells concomitantly exposed to CCl4 for one hour.The antihepatotoxic activities of soyasaponin I and kaikasaponin III, triterpenoidal saponins isolated from Abri Herba, the whole plant of Abrus cantoniensis, were studied on liver injury induced by CCl4 in primary cultured rat hepatocytes. The antihepatotoxic activities of these saponins and glycyrrhizin (positive control) were demonstrated by measuring the levels of glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT) and glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT). Soyasaponin I inhibited the elevation of GOT and GPT activities. The activities were comparable to those of glycyrrhizin. On the other hand, kaikasaponin III was more effective than soyasaponin I and glycyrrhizin. Kaikasaponin III showed the antihepatotoxic activity at less than 100 micrograms/ml. Furthermore, the highest activity was observed even in the lower doses (50, 100 micrograms/ml). However, soyasaponin I and kaikasaponin III showed some toxicity at the highest dose (500 micrograms/ml), though glycyrrhizin did not show toxicity at any dose.	abrus cantoniensis saponins
2	Antiplasmodial potential of traditional phytotherapy of some remedies used in treatment of malaria in Meru-Tharaka Nithi County of Kenya.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Medicinal plants play a major role in many communities across the world, in the treatment and prevention of disease and the promotion of general health. The aim of the study was to escalate documentation from an earlier study of medicinal plants, traditionally used to combat malaria by the Ameru community of Imenti Forest area and Gatunga in Eastern Region of Kenya, and validate their ethnopharmacological claims by evaluating their antiplasmodial efficacies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was carried out in Meru County at Imenti Forest Game Reserve and in Tharaka Nithi County at Gatunga. Traditional health practitioners (THP) were interviewed with a standard questionnaire to obtain information on medicinal plants traditionally used for management of malaria. Group interviews were also held among THPs and members of the community. The antiplasmodial activities of the crude extracts against chloroquine sensitive (D6) and resistant (W2) Plasmodium falciparum were determined using the semi-automated micro-dilution technique that measures the ability of the extracts to inhibit the incorporation of (G-3H) hypoxanthine into the malaria parasite. RESULTS: Ninety nine (99) species in eighty one (81) genera and forty five (45) families were documented and evaluated for in vitro antiplasmodial activity. Compositae, Fabaceae, Meliceae, Rubiaceae, Rutaceae and Verbenaceae had the highest number of species mentioned in treatment of malaria in Meru/Tharaka Nithi study area. Twenty four (24.2%) species showed antiplasmodial efficacy of IC50 &lt;= 5 microg/ml and were considered to have potential for isolation of antimalarial compounds. Eight plant (8) species with moderate antiplasmodial activity namely; Cordia africana, Commiphora africana, Elaeodendron buchananii, Gomphocarpus semilunatus, Tarena graveolens, Plectranthus igniarius, Acacia senegal and Ziziphus abyssinica were documented from this region for the first time for the treatment of malaria. The antiplasmodial activity of MeOH root bark extract of Maytenus obtusifolia was very promising (IC50 &lt; 1.9 microg/ml) and this is the first report on traditional use of M. obtusifolia for treatment of malaria and antimalarial activity. CONCLUSIONS: The results seem to indicate that ethnopharmacological inquiry used in search for new herbal remedies as predictive and could be used as the basis for search of new active principles. Eight plant (8) species are documented from this region for the first time for the treatment of malaria. This is the first report on traditional use of M. obtusifolia for treatment of malaria and evaluation of its antiplasmodial activity.	ziziphus abyssinica malaria
3	Evaluation of relaxant responses properties of cinnamon essential oil and its major component, cinnamaldehyde on human and rat corpus cavernosum.Cinnamomum cassia (Cinnamon) is a well-known traditional medicine with therapeutic benefits for centuries. We evaluated the effects of cinnamon essential oil (CEO) and its main component cinnamaldehyde (CA) on human corpus cavernosum (HCC) and rat CC. The essential oil of cinnamon was analyzed for the confirmation of the oil profile. HCC specimens from patients undergoing penile prosthesis surgery (age 48-69 years) were utilized for functional studies. In addition, erectile responses in anesthetized control and diabetic rats were evaluated in vivo after intracavernosal injection of CEO and CA, and rat CC strips were placed in organ baths. After precontraction with phenylephrine (10muM), relaxant responses to CEO and CA were investigated. CA (96.9%) was found as the major component. The maximum relaxation responses to CEO and CA were 96.4+-3.5% and 96.0+-5.0% in HCC and 97.5+-5.5% and 96.8+-4.8% in rat CC, respectively. There was no difference between control and diabetic rats in relaxation responses to CEO and CA. The relaxant responses obtained with essential oil and CA were not attenuated in the presence of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, and soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor (sGS) in CC. In vivo, erectile responses in diabetic rats were lower than in control rats, which was restored after intracavernosal injection of CEO and CA. CEO and CA improved erectile function and relaxation of isolated strips of rat CC and HCC by a NO/cGMP-independent mechanism. Further investigations are warranted to fully elucidate the restorative effects of CEO and CA on diabetic erectile dysfunction.	cinnamaldehyde diabetic erectile dysfunction
1	Pharmacognostic and phytochemical studies of Zanthoxylum armatum DC.The pharmacognostic and phytochemical investigations on the leaf, stem bark, and fruit of Zanthoxylum armatum were carried out. Macroscopic study of leaf, stem bark, and fruit of Z. armatum revealed some of the characteristic features like size, shape, color, odor and taste of the crude drug. Distinguishing fragments were identified from the powder drug. Leaf, bark, and fruit powder of this plant have higher values of total, acid insoluble, and water soluble ash as compared to the powder of this plant exhausted with ethanol and n- hexane. Extraction values in methanol were highest for leaves (20.10%) and fruit (11%), while bark showed highest value in chloroform (8.5%). The extractive values varied among other parts with different solvents. Fluorescence analysis of the Z. Armatum leaf, stem bark, and fruit powder with various reagents showed characteristic coloration at day and under UV light. Quantitative phytochemical screening revealed the presence of many bioactive constituents in leaves, such as alkaloids (15.60+-0.10 mg/g), sterols (71.60+-0.10mg/g), saponins (21.57+-0.12mg/g), tannins (34.43+-0.21mg/g), phenols (11.66+-0.33mg/g) and flavonoids (13.68+-0.66mg/g). Alkaloids (19.60+-0.10mg/g), sterols (33.83+-0.29mg/g), saponins (14.78+-0.10mg/g), tannins (28.62+-0.13mg/g), phenols (16.48+-1.33mg/g) and flavonoids (18.33+-1.22mg/g) were reported form the bark, while fruits were reported to have alkaloids (25.07+-0.21mg/g), sterols (164.92+-0.14mg/g), saponins (28.60+-0.10mg/g), tannins (35.5+-0.5mg/g), phenols (21.68+-0.44mg/g) and flavonoids (22.8+-1.33mg/g). Z. armatum is an important medicinal plant, traditionally used for various ailments. This study will be helpful in the future pharmacognostic standardization of this important plant.	z. armatum flavonoids
1	Active compound diffusivity of particle size reduced S. aromaticum and C. cassia fused starch edible films and the shelf life of mutton (Capra aegagrus hircus) meat.In the present study, mathematical models were used to examine the effect of active compound diffusion from edible film (supplemented with S. aromaticum and C. cassia) on the microbial, physical and chemical quality of mutton stored at 4 and 10 C. Cinnamaldehyde and eugenol release from edible film into liquid was found to be 80% and 75% of the equilibrium concentration. Active compound release into meat was 42-51% for cinnamaldehyde and 38-48% for eugenol, in storage temperatures of 4-15 C. Developed mathematical models showed the diffusivity of cinnamaldehyde (0.45x10-15+-0.04x10-15) and eugenol (0.63x10-10+-0.01x10-10) into meat, which was about 40% of that in liquid medium. On comparing physical, chemical and microbial results, shelf life of mutton meat was found to be increased by 1week at storage temperature of 10 C and 3weeks at storage temperature of 4 C.	c. cassia eugenol
1	Chemical composition and tyrosinase inhibitory activity of Cinnamomum cassia essential oil.BACKGROUND: Essential oils extracted from aromatic plants exhibit important biological activities and have become increasingly important for scientific research. The essential oil extracted from Cinnamomum cassia Presl (CC-EO) has various functional properties, however, little information is available regarding the tyrosinase inhibitory activity. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to investigate the chemical composition and tyrosinase inhibitory activity of the CC-EO. RESULTS: cis-2-methoxycinnamic acid (43.06%) and cinnamaldehyde (42.37%) were found to be the two major components of the CC-EO identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The inhibitory activities of CC-EO and its major constituents were further evaluated against mushroom tyrosinase. The results showed that CC-EO and cinnamaldehyde exhibited anti-tyrosinase activities with IC50 values of 6.16 +- 0.04 mg/mL and 4.04 +- 0.08 mg/mL, respectively. However, cis-2-methoxycinnamic acid did not show any anti-tyrosinase activity. The inhibition kinetics were analyzed by Lineweaver-Burk plots and second replots, which revealed that CC-EO and cinnamaldehyde were mixed-type inhibitors. The inhibition constants (Ki) for CC-EO and cinnamaldehyde were calculated to be 4.71 +- 0.09 mg/mL and 2.38 +- 0.09 mg/mL, respectively. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that CC-EO and its major component, cinnamaldehyde, possess potent anti-tyrosinase activities and may be a good source for skin-whitening agents.	cinnamomum cassia cinnamaldehyde
1	Looking for Arabidopsis thaliana peroxidases involved in lignin biosynthesis.Monolignol polymerization into lignin is catalyzed by peroxidases or laccases. Recently, a Zinnia elegans peroxidase (ZePrx) that is considered responsible for monolignol polymerization in this plant has been molecularly and functionally characterized. Nevertheless, Arabidopsis thaliana has become an alternative model plant for studies of lignification, filling the gaps that may occur with Z. elegans. The arabidopsis genome offers the possibility of performing bioinformatic analyses and data mining that are not yet feasible with other plant species, in order to obtain preliminary evidence on the role of genes and proteins. In our search for arabidopsis homologs to the ZePrx, we performed an exhaustive in silico characterization of everything from the protein to the transcript of Arabidopsis thaliana peroxidases (AtPrxs) homologous to ZePrx, with the aim of identifying one or more peroxidases that may be involved in monolignol polymerization. Nine peroxidases (AtPrx 4, 5, 52, 68, 67, 36, 14, 49 and 72) with an E-value greater than 1e-80 with ZePrx were selected for this study. The results demonstrate that a high level of 1D, 2D and 3D homology between these AtPrxs and ZePrx are not always accompanied by the presence of the same electrostatic and mRNA properties that indicate a peroxidase is involved in lignin biosynthesis. In summary, we can confirm that the peroxidases involved in lignification are among AtPrx 4, 52, 49 and 72. Their structural and mRNA features indicate that exert their action in the cell wall similar to ZePrx. 	z. elegans lignin
3	A platinum(II) complex of liriodenine from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM): Cell cycle arrest, cell apoptosis induction and telomerase inhibition activity via G-quadruplex DNA stabilization.Liriodenine (L), an antitumor active ingredient from the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Zanthoxylum nitidum, afforded a platinum(II) complex (1) of L, cis-[PtCl2(L)(DMSO)], which previously reported for its in vitro antitumor activity and intercalative binding with DNA. In this study, complex 1 was further discussed for its antitumor mechanism and structure-activity relationship, comparing with L and cisplatin. Towards the most sensitive BEL-7404 human hepatoma cells, complex 1 significantly induced cell cycle arrest at both G2/M phase and S phase. It suggests that double helix DNA is not the simplex intracellular target for 1. On the other hand, the BEL-7404 cells incubated with 1 and stained by Hoechst 33258 and AO/EB showed typical cell apoptosis in dose-dependent manner. The BEL-7404 cells incubated with 1 and stained by JC-1 were also characteristic for cell apoptosis on the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, the G-quadruplex DNA binding property of complex 1 was also investigated by spectroscopic analyses, fluorescent indicator displacement (FID) assay and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. The results indicated that 1 stabilized the human telomeric G4-HTG21 DNA better than L. The telomerase inhibition ratio of 1 ((62.50+-0.03)%), which was examined by telomerase polymerase chain reaction-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (PCR-ELISA), was much higher than L ((21.77+-0.01)%). It can be ascribed to the better G4-HTG21 DNA stabilization of 1 than L. The results suggested that the nuclei, mitochondria and telomerase via G-quadruplex DNA stabilization all should be key targets for the antitumor mechanism of 1, in which the central platinum(II) played a key role.

2	Analysis of IgE binding proteins of mesquite (Prosopis juliflora) pollen and cross-reactivity with predominant tree pollens.Pollen from the mesquite tree, Prosopis juliflora, is an important source of respiratory allergy in tropical countries. Our aim was to partially characterize the IgE binding proteins of P. juliflora pollen extract and study cross-reactivity with prevalent tree pollen allergens. Intradermal tests with P. juliflora and five other tree pollen extracts were performed on respiratory allergy patients from Bikaner (arid) and Delhi (semi arid). Prosopis extract elicited positive skin reactions in 71/220 of the patients. Sera were collected from 38 of these 71 patients and all demonstrated elevated specific IgE to P. juliflora. Immunoblotting with pooled patients' sera demonstrated 16 IgE binding components, with components of 24, 26, 29, 31, 35, 52, 58, 66 and 95 kDa recognized by more than 80% of individual patients' sera. P. juliflora extract is allergenically potent requiring 73 ng of self-protein for 50% inhibition of IgE binding in ELISA inhibition. Cross-inhibition assays showed close relationship among P. juliflora, Ailanthus excelsa, Cassia siamea and Salvadora persica. IgE binding components of 14, 41, 52 and 66 kDa were shared allergens whereas 26 and 29 kDa were specific to P. juliflora. The findings suggest that purification of cross-reactive allergens will be helpful for diagnosis and immunotherapy of tree pollen allergic patients.	p. juliflora allergic
1	Identification of the potential active components of Abelmoschus manihot in rat blood and kidney tissue by microdialysis combined with ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry.In this paper, microdialysis combining with ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) was applied to simultaneously identify components in blood and kidney dialysis after oral administration of Abelmoschus manihot extract. Microdialysis probe was implanted in the jugular vein and the kidney medulla, respectively; microdialysis samples were collected continuously, transferred to microtubes and analyzed by UPLC-Q-TOF/MS. The components in microdialysis samples were separated by an UPLC HSS T3 column and eluted with acetonitrile and water (containing 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The results showed that unbound constituents in blood circulation of the rat include hyperoside, isoquercitrin, quercetin monoglucuronide, quercetin-3'-O-glucoside, quercetin, myricetin, and hibifolin while unbound constituents in kidney are hyperoside, isoquercitrin, quercetin monoglucuronide, which might be the potential active components in vivo. The developed method was simple and reliable, and could be adopted to rapidly screen and identify potential active components contributing to pharmacological effects of TCM and to better clarify its action mechanism.	abelmoschus manihot isoquercitrin
2	Cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic effects of Abrus precatorius L. on human metastatic breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231.Abrus precatorius is highly regarded as a universal panacea in the herbal medicine with diverse pharmacological activity spectra. This experimental study on the mechanism of the anticancer activity of A. precatorius leaf extracts, may offer new evidence for A. precatorius in the treatment of breast cancer in clinical practice. Cell death was determined by using MTT assay. Further analyses were carried out by doing DNA laddering, PARP cleavage, FACS, semi-quantitative RT-PCR and detection of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) by DCFDA assay. A. precatorius showed very striking inhibition on MDA-MB-231 cells. MTT assay showed more than 75 % inhibition of the cells and treated cells indicated visible laddering pattern with thick compact band. PARP cleavage produced 89 kDa cleavage product which was associated with apoptosis. Flow cytometer exhibited a sub-G0/G1 peak as an indicative of apoptosis. mRNA expression level of apoptosis-related genes p21 and p53 was markedly increased in cells treated with the extract as compared to control. The up-regulation of p21 and p53 may be the molecular mechanisms by which A. precatorius extract which induces apoptosis. An increase in the concentration of A. precatorius extract does not generate ROS, instead it reduces ROS formation in MDA-MB-231 cells, as evident from the shift in fluorescence below untreated control. This is the first report showing that A. precatorius leaf extract exhibits a growth inhibitory effect by induction of apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. Our results contribute towards validation of the A. precatorius extract as a potentially effective chemopreventive or therapeutic agent against breast cancer.	a. precatorius breast cancer
1	New phenylpropenoids, bis(1-phenylethyl)phenols, bisquinolinone alkaloid, and anti-inflammatory constituents from Zanthoxylum integrifoliolum.Five new compounds, including two new phenylpropenoids, (R,E)-1-[4-(3-hydroxyprop-1-enyl)phenoxy]-3-methylbutane-2,3-diol (1) and 4-hydroxy-3-(3-methyl-2-butenyl)cinnamyl alcohol (2), two new bis(1-phenylethyl)phenols, 2,6-bis(1-phenylethyl)phenol (3) and 2,4-bis(1-phenylethyl)phenol (4), and a new bisquinolinone alkaloid, 18-demethylparaensidimerin C (5), together with 17 known compounds have been isolated from the stem wood of Zanthoxylum integrifoliolum. The structures of these new compounds were determined through spectral analyses including extensive 2D nuclear magnetic resonance data. Among the isolates, N-methylflindersine (7), (-)-simulanol (10), and evofolin-C (16) exhibited potent inhibition against N-formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine-induced superoxide production with IC(50) values less than 12 microM.	zanthoxylum integrifoliolum (-)-simulanol
2	Fumigant, contact, and repellent activities of essential oils against the darkling beetle, Alphitobius diaperinus.The fumigant, contact, and repellent activities of four essential oils extracted from Citrus limonum (Sapindales: Rutaceae), Litsea cubeba (Laurales: Lauraceae), Cinnamomum cassia, and Allium sativum L. (Asparagales: Alliaceae) against 6th instars and adults of the darkling beetle, Alphitobius diaperinus (Panzer) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), one of the main pests of materials and products of Juncus effuses L. (Poales: Juncaceae) during the storage period, were assayed, and chemical ingredients were analyzed with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in this study. While the major ingredients found in C. limonum and C. cassia were limonene and (E)-cinnamaldehyde, the main constituents of L. cubea were D-limonene, (E)-3,7-dimethyl-,2,6-octadienal, (Z)-3,7-dimethyl,2 ,6-octadienal, and diallyl disulphide (18.20%), while the main constituents of and A. sativum were di-2-propenyl trisulfide and di-2-propenyl tetrasulfide. The fumigation activities of A. sativum and C. limonum on A. diaperinus adults were better than those of the other two essential oilss. The toxicities of A. sativum and C. limonum were almost equitoxic at 96 hr after treatment. Essential oils from Allium sativum and L. cubeba also showed good contact activities from 24 hr to 48 hr, and toxicities were almost equitoxic 48 hr posttreatment. The repellent activities of A. sativum and L. cubeba oils on 6th instars were also observed, showing repellence indexes of 90.4% and 88.9% at 12 hr after treatment, respectively. The effects of A. sativum on AChE activity of 6th instars of A. diaperinus were strongest compared to the other essential oils, followed by C. limonum, L. cubeba, and C. cassia. These results suggest that the essential oils of C. limonum and A. sativum could serve as effective control agents of A. diaperinus.	c. limonum toxicities
2	Dynamic changes of flavonoids in Abelmoschus manihot different organs at different growth periods by UPLC-MS/MS.Abelmoschus manihot (Linn.) Medicus has been clinically used to treat chronic kidney disease, oral ulcers, burns, and dysmenorrhea in China for many centuries. The major pharmacologically-active components of A. manihot are flavonoids. In this study, a rapid and highly sensitive UPLC-MS/MS analysis method was established and successfully applied to the simultaneous determination of five major flavonoids (rutin, hyperoside, isoquercitrin, quercetin, and myricetin) in different parts of A. manihot harvested at ten growth periods. Under the optimized chromatographic conditions, good separation for five target components was obtained on an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column within 18min. The total contents of the five investigated flavonoids in A. manihot roots, stems, leaves and flowers ranged from 2.86 to 123.7mug/g, 46.39 to 141.0mug/g, 929.4 to 3096mug/g, and 10,150 to 19,390mug/g, respectively, indicating that the total flavonoids in the four parts could be mainly arranged in a decreasing order as flower&gt;leaf&gt;stem&gt;root. The peak of total flavonoids in flowers and leaves appeared at G8 and G9, respectively. These results will be helpful for the determination of the suitable harvest time of A. manihot and the improvement of the utility value of the disused parts.	a. manihot oral ulcers
1	Components and insecticidal activity against the maize weevils of Zanthoxylum schinifolium fruits and leaves.In our screening program for new agrochemicals from Chinese medicinal herbs and wild plants, Zanthoxylum schinifolium essential oils were found to possess strong insecticidal activity against the maize weevil Sitophilus zeamais. The essential oils of Z. schinifolium fruits and leaves were extracted via hydrodistillation and investigated by GC and GC-MS. Estragole (69.52%) was the major compound of the essential oil of fresh fruits, followed by linalool (8.63%) and limonene (4.34%) and 94.33% of the total components were monoterpenoids. The main components of the essential oil of fresh leaves were linalool (12.94%), ar-tumerone (8.95%), limonene (6.45%) and elixene (5.43%) and only 50.62% were monoterpenoids. However, the essential oil from purchased fruits contained linalool (33.42%), limonene (13.66%) and sabinene (5.72%), followed by estragole (4.67%), nerol (4.56%) and 4-terpineol (4.27%). Estragole, linalool and sabinene were separated and purified by silica gel column chromatography and preparative thin layer chromatography, and further identified by means of physicochemical and spectrometric analysis. The essential oil from the fresh fruits (LD50 = 15.93 mug/adult) possessed two times more toxicity to the insects compared with that of fresh leaves (LD50 = 35.31 mug/adult). Estragole, linalool and sabinene exhibited contact activity against S. zeamais with LD50 values of 17.63, 13.90 and 23.98 mug/adult, respectively. The essential oils of Z. schinifolium possessed strong fumigant toxicity against S. zeamais adults with LC50 values of 13.19 mg/L (fresh fruits), 24.04 mg/L (fresh leaves) and 17.63 mg/L (purchased fruits). Estragole, linalool and sabinene also exhibited strong fumigant toxicity against the maize weevils with LC50 values of 14.10, 10.46 and 9.12 mg/L, respectively.	z. schinifolium monoterpenoids
3	Myricetin as the active principle of Abelmoschus moschatus to lower plasma glucose in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.The antihyperglycemic action of myricetin, purified from the aerial part of Abelmoschus moschatus (Malvaceae), was investigated in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (STZ-diabetic rats). Bolus intravenous injection of myricetin decreased the plasma glucose concentrations in a dose-dependent manner in STZ-diabetic rats. Myricetin at the effective dose (1.0 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the increase of plasma glucose induced by an intravenous glucose challenge test in normal rats. A stimulatory effect of myricetin on glucose uptake of the soleus muscles isolated from STZ-diabetic rats was obtained in a concentration-dependent manner from 0.01 to 10.0 micromol/L. The increase of glucose utilization by myricetin was further characterized using the enhancement of glycogen synthesis in isolated hepatocytes of STZ-diabetic rats. These results suggest that myricetin has an ability to enhance glucose utilization to lower plasma glucose in diabetic rats lacking insulin.	myricetin diabetic
1	Combined analysis by GC (RI), GC-MS and 13C NMR of the supercritical fluid extract of Abies alba twigs.Two samples (leaves and twigs) of Abies alba Miller from Corsica were extracted using supercritical CO2 and their chemical compositions were compared with those of the essential oils obtained from the same batch of plant material. In total 45 components were identified using combined analysis by GC (RI), GC-MS and 13C NMR. It was observed that the contents of monoterpenes (mainly represented by limonene, alpha-pinene and camphene) were significantly lower in the supercritical fluid extract (SFE) than in the essential oil (EO). Conversely, the proportions of sesquiterpenes were much higher in CO2 extracts than in essential oils (around 30% vs 4%). Cis-abienol, a diterpene alcohol, was identified only in SFE, and the proportions of this constituent (7.5% and 17.3%) were determined using quantitative 13C NMR since it was under estimated using the standard conditions of GC.	abies alba sesquiterpenes
2	[Analysis on volatile constituents of Semen Ziziphi Spinosae by HS-SPME-GC-MS].OBJECTIVE: To establish a rapid and simple method for the determination of volatile constituents in Semen Ziziphi Spinosae. METHODS: The volatile constituents in Semen Ziziphi Spinosae were extracted by head space solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and analysed by GC-MS. RESULTS: Powder of sample was pre-heated for 30 min at 90 degrees C, then headspace-extracted with 65 microm PDMS/DVB fiber for 50 min. After desorbed for 5 min at 250 degrees C, the separation was well completed on a Rxi -50 capillary column. 126 kinds of volatile compounds were isolated and 116 compounds were identified. The amounts of compound from the volatile constituents were determined by area normalization method. The main components extracted by HS-SPME were alkane (32.08%), terpenoid and derivatives of oxygenated terpenoid (27.06%). CONCLUSION: The method is simple, fast and accurate, and it is suitable for the determination of the volatile constituents in fruit of Ziziphus jujuba.	ziziphus jujuba terpenoid
1	Efficient quantification of the phenolic profiles of Zanthoxylum bungeanum leaves and correlation between chromatographic fingerprint and antioxidant activity.Sixteen subsequent fractions were prepared from the ethyl acetate fraction of Zanthoxylum bungeanum leaves after bio-guided chromatographic separation. The HPLC profiles and antioxidant activity of the various fractions indicated that the content of eight phenolic compounds (chlorogenic acid, epicatechin, rutin, hyperoside, trifolin, quercitrin, afzelin and quercetin) and antioxidant activity vary significantly, and high concentrations of a combination of eight phenolic compounds would result in an increase of the antioxidant activity. These results suggested that the eight compounds could be used as chemical markers for quality assessment of Z. bungeanum leaves. Correlation between chromatographic fingerprint and antioxidant activity of the fractions showed that quercitrin and hyperoside play crucial roles in the antioxidant activity, and they can be seen as the milestone for quality control. The findings also suggested that five obtained fractions (E-3-3, E-2-4, E-7, E-5 and E-4) could become useful supplements for functional food ingredients and health-related products. 	z. bungeanum chlorogenic acid
3	Potential mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase R140Q mutant inhibitor from traditional Chinese medicine against cancers.A recent research of cancer has indicated that the mutant of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1 and 2) genes will induce various cancers, including chondrosarcoma, cholangiocarcinomas, and acute myelogenous leukemia due to the effect of point mutations in the active-site arginine residues of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), such as IDH1/R132, IDH2/R140, and IDH2/R172. As the inhibition for those tumor-associated mutant IDH proteins may induce differentiation of those cancer cells, these tumor-associated mutant IDH proteins can be treated as a drug target proteins for a differentiation therapy against cancers. In this study, we aim to identify the potent TCM compounds from the TCM Database@Taiwan as lead compounds of IDH2 R140Q mutant inhibitor. Comparing to the IDH2 R140Q mutant protein inhibitor, AGI-6780, the top two TCM compounds, precatorine and abrine, have higher binding affinities with target protein in docking simulation. After MD simulation, the top two TCM compounds remain as the same docking poses under dynamic conditions. In addition, precatorine is extracted from Abrus precatorius L., which represents the cytotoxic and proapoptotic effects for breast cancer and several tumor lines. Hence, we propose the TCM compounds, precatorine and abrine, as potential candidates as lead compounds for further study in drug development process with the IDH2 R140Q mutant protein against cancer. 	abrine breast cancer
1	Antimicrobial study of essential oils of Ocimum gratissimum leaves and Zanthoxylum xanthoxyloides fruits from Cameroon.An investigation of antimicrobial activities of essential oils of fresh leaves of Ocimum gratissimum and the essential oil of the dried fruits of Zanthoxylum xanthoxyloides was carried out. The essential oils showed extensive inhibition zones and are, therefore, effective antimicrobial systems.	ocimum gratissimum essential oils
1	Seed oil and fatty acid content in okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) and related species.Approximately 1100 genebank accessions of okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) and 540 additional accessions that included six of its related species-A. caillei, A. crinitis, A. esculentus, A. ficulneus, A. manihot, A. moschatus and A. tuberculatus-were evaluated for seed oil content using time domain NMR (TD-NMR). Oil content in seed of A. caillei, A. esculentus, A. ficulneus, A. manihot, A. moschatus and A. tuberculatus was in the ranges 2.51-13.61%, 12.36-21.56%, 6.62-16.7%, 16.1-22.0%, 10.3-19.8% and 10.8-23.2%, respectively. Accession PI639680 (A. tuberculatus) had the highest seed oil content (~23%). Accessions of A. esculentus with high seed oil content included PI nos. PI274350 (21.5%), PI538082 (20.9%) and PI538097 (20.9%). Values for the three accessions of A. manihot with the highest seed oil content were PI nos. PI639673 (20.4%), PI639674 (20.9%) and PI639675 (21.9%), all representing var. tetraphyllus. Average percent seed oil in materials of A. esculentus from Turkey and Sudan (17.35% and 17.36%, respectively) exceeded the averages of materials from other locations. Ninety-eight accessions (total of six species) were also examined for fatty acid composition. Values of linoleic acid ranged from 23.6-50.65% in A. esculentus. However, mean linoleic acid concentrations were highest in A. tuberculatus and A. ficulneus. Concentrations of palmitic acid were significantly higher in A. esculentus (range of 10.3-36.35%) when compared to that of other species, and reached a maximum in PI489800 Concentrations of palmitic acid were also high in A. caillei (mean = ~30%). Levels of oleic acid were highest in A. manihot, A. manihot var. tetraphyllus and A. moschatus.	a. esculentus palmitic acid

Estragole, linalool and sabinene also exhibited strong fumigant toxicity against the maize weevils with LC50 values of 14.10, 10.46 and 9.12 mg/L, respectively.	z. schinifolium linalool
2	Characterization and evaluation of bioactive polyphenolic constituents from Zanthoxylum armatum DC., a traditionally used plant.Zanthoxylum armatum or Timoor has been used in different traditional system of medicine due to its aromatic properties and also in the treatment of cancer, diarrhea and cholera. In the present investigation, four chemically distinct compounds namely Tambulin (6), Prudomestin (7), Ombuin (8) and 3, 4, 5, 3', 4', 5'-hexahydroxydiphenyl ether (9) have been isolated and quantified from the fruits. To explore the biological activities, we have further studied the antiproliferative, antimicrobial and antioxidant efficacy. Tambulin which was also found in maximum amount (0.125%) in fruits revealed significant antiproliferative activity (IC50 37.96+-0.36 to 48.7+-0.21mug/mL) against breast, liver, colon and skin cancer cell lines corroborated by resilient binding interaction with SDH (-6.76Kcal/mol) and inhibition constant (Ki: 11.02muM). Hexane and ethyl acetate fraction exhibited moderate antibacterial efficacy (MIC: 250-1000mug/mL) against selected pathogenic microbes while Ombuin displayed broad spectrum antibacterial effect with MIC ranges from 125 to 500mug/mL. Total phenolic content (5.27+-0.06 to 46.12+-0.40mg/g of gallic acid equivalents), total flavonoids content (6.05+-0.24 to 14.46+-0.73mg/g of quercetin equivalents), ferric reducing power (42.35+-0.85 to 62.52+-0.66mg/g of ferrous sulfate equivalents) and percent free radical scavenging activity (59.56+-0.38 to 64.85+-1.78) were also estimated. Our findings infer that Tambulin exhibited significant antiproliferative activity whereas Ombuin was found to display broad spectrum antibacterial activity which adds one more positive attribute to its traditional usage.	zanthoxylum armatum cancer
2	Attempted suicide, by mail order: Abrus precatorius.OBJECTIVE: Abrus precatorius is cultivated in many subtropical areas. The seeds exist in a variety of colors such as black, orange, and most commonly, glossy red. A black band is found at the end of the seed. The plant contains multiple pods which typically contain three to five Abrus seeds. The seeds contain abrin, which inhibits ribosomal function, halting protein synthesis and leading to cellular death. A unique aspect of this case is the use of the internet to order a potentially lethal poison as well as transmission of a picture to identify the seed. CASE REPORT: A 20-year-old man presented to the emergency department complaining of vomiting and watery diarrhea for 6-8 h prior to arrival. He denied any medication use, recent illness, travel, or changes in his diet. Initial vital signs were normal. The patient was diagnosed with viral gastroenteritis. During his evaluation, the patient admitted to feeling suicidal. While awaiting psychiatry evaluation, the patient's father arrived with a box of small hard red seeds, which he believed that his son ingested in a suicide attempt. The seeds could not be identified by the staff. A picture of the seeds was transmitted by e-mail to the New York City Poison Control Center, allowing their identification as A. precatorius. The patient was reinterviewed and admitted to chewing and swallowing 10 seeds. Given the potential toxicity of abrin, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. He continued to have frequent episodes of emesis as well as diarrhea. He gradually improved over 2 days. He admitted to ordering a box of Abrus seeds online from Asia after reading on the Internet about their use in suicide. He was eventually discharged for outpatient follow-up with no permanent sequelae. CONCLUSION: Abrin has an estimated human fatal dose of 0.1-1 mug/kg. Most cases of Abrus seed ingestions are unintentional and occur in children. Ingesting the intact seeds typically results in no clinical findings, as they pass through the gastrointestinal tract due to their hard shell. Abrin released during chewing is poorly absorbed systemically from the gastrointestinal tract. This causes the vomiting and diarrhea with resultant hypovolemia and electrolyte disturbances, which can be severe and life threatening, particularly in areas with less advanced health care systems. Management is primarily supportive.	a. precatorius hypovolemia
2	Zanthoxylum avicennae extracts induce cell apoptosis through protein             phosphatase 2A activation in HA22T human hepatocellular carcinoma cells and block             tumor growth in xenografted nude mice.The use of herbs as alternative cancer therapies has attracted a great deal of attention owing to their lower toxicity. Whether Zanthoxylum avicennae (Ying Bu Bo, YBB) induces liver cancer cell apoptosis remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of YBB extracts (YBBEs) on HA22T human hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro and in an in vivo mouse xenograft model. HA22T cells were treated with different concentrations of YBBEs and analyzed with Western blot analysis, TUNEL, JC-1 staining and siRNA transfection assays. Additionally, the HA22T-implanted xenograft nude mice model was applied to confirm the cellular effects. YBBEs-induced apoptosis, up-regulated death receptor apoptotic pathway markers as well as mitochondrial proteins, and suppressed the survival proteins in a dose-dependent manner. Pro-survival Bcl-2 family proteins were inhibited and the pro-apoptotic ones were increased. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) siRNA or okadaic acid reversed the YBBEs effects, confirming the role of PP2A in YBBEs-induced HA22T apoptosis. All our experimental evidence indicates that YBBEs significantly promote HA22T apoptosis and reduce tumor sizes in xenograft nude mice via PP2A in a dose-dependent manner.	zanthoxylum avicennae hepatocellular carcinoma
1	Dihydrobenzo[c]phenanthridine alkaloids from stem bark of Zanthoxylum nitidum.Five novel alkaloids, zanthomuurolanine ( 1), epi-zanthomuurolanine ( 2), zanthocadinanines A ( 3) and B ( 4), and epi-zanthocadinanine B ( 5), composed of dihydrochelerythrine and a cadinane-type sesquiterpene linked by a methylene bridge, have been isolated from stem bark of Zanthoxylum nitidum. These structures were elucidated by spectroscopic techniques (UV, IR, MS, CD, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, DEPT, COSY, NOESY, HSQC, and HMBC analyses). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies confirmed the relative configurations of 1 and 4 and provided additional support for the structures of 2, 3, and 5.	zanthoxylum nitidum alkaloids
1	Comparison of drip, pipe and surge spring root irrigation for Jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) fruit quality in the Loess plateau of China.Loess Plateau is a typical rain-fed farming region, facing the threat of drought. Irrigation method is among the most important factors affecting jujube quality. This study investigated the response of Ziziphus jujuba Mill. cv. Lizao quality to three different irrigation methods (drip-, pipe- and surge spring root irrigation) combining two water levels (20 m(3)/hm(2) and 120 m(3)/hm(2)). The effects of the trials were evaluated by taking into account the physical-chemical characteristics of jujubes and the antioxidant activity. Concomitant to this, the concentration of some taste-related (viz. glucose, fructose, TSS and malic acid) and health-related compounds/parameters (viz. catechin and epicatechin) were generally much greater in jujube fruit treated with drip irrigation (120 m(3)/hm(2)). Different irrigation treatments had no significant effects on antioxidant capacity, total phenolics and proanthocyanidins (except for pipe irrigation 20 m(3)/hm(2)). The best compromise between quality and irrigation of jujube fruit was achieved with drip irrigation (120 m(3)/hm(2)). 	jujube glucose
2	Bioactive components in the fruits of Ziziphus jujuba Mill. against the inflammatory irritant action of Euphorbia plants.Chinese jujube (also known as Chinese date) is the fruit of Ziziphus jujuba Mill. (Rhamnaceae). As a famous folk medicine, it is used as antidote in traditional Chinese formula, Shi Zao Decoction, to relieve the drastic inflammatory irritant nature of Euphorbia species. The irritant activities may cause serious adverse effects in clinical practices. This study aimed to investigate the active components of Z. jujuba through the inhibitory effects on the inflammatory cells activated by Euphorbia kansui and prostratin, a phorbol ester isolated from Euphorbia fischeriana. Peritoneal macrophage of rat and splenic lymphocyte (splenocyte) of mouse were selected to evaluate these actions in vitro. Nitric oxide (NO) release of macrophage and the proliferation of splenocyte were examined through Griess method and MTT assay. TNF-alpha, as an important pro-inflammatory cytokines, was detected with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Six fractions extracted from Z. jujuba were evaluated and fraction F (triterpene acids fraction) was demonstrated to be the most active part, and then, 21 compounds isolated from Z. jujuba were tested at the concentrations range from 1 mug/ml to 100 mug/ml. The results show that 7 compounds of them are likely to be active compounds concerning to their pronounced inhibitory action on the activated inflammatory cells. These effects might be helpful to attenuate the irritant action of Euphorbiaceae plants and protect the gastrointestinal tissue from potent inflammatory injury, which should be beneficial to some diseases, like inflammatory bowel disease.	z. jujuba inflammatory bowel disease
1	Ultrasound-Assisted Extraction of Taxifolin, Diosmin, and Quercetin from Abies nephrolepis (Trautv.) Maxim: Kinetic and Thermodynamic Characteristics.Extraction behaviors of the 3 flavonoids taxifolin, diosmin, and quercetin have been investigated in Abies nephrolepis leaves and bark. The following operation parameters-ethanol volume fraction, liquid-solid ratio, temperature, ultrasound irradiation power and time, and ultrasound frequency-were varied to study their effect on the yield of the 3 flavonoids during extraction. The results showed that a low extraction efficiency occurred at 293.15 K due to slow kinetics, while the situation was significantly improved at 333.15 K. The kinetic data for the extraction yields of the 3 flavonoids achieved good fits by the first-order kinetic model. From the thermodynamic analysis results, we realized that the ultrasound-assisted extraction of taxifolin, diosmin, and quercetin from the leaves and bark of A. nephrolepis was a spontaneous and endothermic process in which the disorder increased (DeltaG0 < 0, DeltaH0 > 0, and DeltaS0 > 0). According to the response surface methodology (RSM) analysis, under the optimal operation conditions (ethanol concentration of 50%, liquid-solid ratio of 20 mL/g, frequency of 45 kHz, extraction time of 39.25 min, ultrasound irradiation power of 160 W and temperature of 332.19 K), the total yield of the 3 flavonoids were 100.93 +- 4.01 mg/g from the leaves of A. nephrolepis (with 31.03 +- 1.51 mg/g, 0.31 +- 0.01 mg/g, 69.59 +- 2.57 mg/g for taxifolin, diosmin, and quercetin, respectively), and under the optimal operation conditions (ethanol concentration of 50%, liquid-solid ratio of 20 mL/g, frequency of 45 kHz, extraction time of 36.80 min, ultrasound irradiation power of 150 W and temperature of 328.78 K), 16.05 mg/g +- 0.38 mg/g were obtained from the bark of A. nephrolepis (with 1.44 +- 0.05 mg/g, 0.47 +- 0.01 mg/g, 14.14 +- 0.38 mg/g for taxifolin, diosmin, and quercetin, respectively), which were close to the prediction values.	a. nephrolepis quercetin
1	Comparison of flavonoids, phenolic acids, and antioxidant activity of explosion-puffed and sun-dried jujubes (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.).The goal of the present study was to investigate the effect of explosion puffing and sun-drying on individual phenolic acids in four forms (free, esters, glycosides, and insoluble-bound), flavonoids, total phenolic content (TPC), and their antioxidant activity on jujube samples. Phenolic compounds were identified and quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography. Antioxidant capacity of jujube samples was evaluated by 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical scavenging activity and total reducing power. The results showed that all samples significantly differed in their phenolic contents, phenolic acid and flavonoid composition, and antioxidant activities. The explosion-puffed jujubes had the highest total gallic, p-hydroxybenzoic, vanillic, p-coumaric, ferulic acids, and rutin contents. Also, explosion-puffed jujubes contained a higher level of total phenolics and antioxidant activity than their counterparts. Among phenolic acid fractions in four forms, each form of phenolic acids in explosion-puffed jujubes had the most abundant content, followed by fresh and sun-dried jujubes. The glycosided and insoluble-bound phenolic acid fractions for each sample represented the highest TPC and the strongest antioxidant activity. The results indicated explosion puffing was a good choice for jujube processing.	jujube rutin
3	Inhibitory effect of Zanthoxylum bungeanum seed oil on ovalbumin-induced lung inflammation in a murine model of asthma.The present study aimed to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of Zanthoxylum bungeanum seed oil (Z. seed oil) to alleviate airway inflammation in asthmatic mice. The asthmatic mice were treated with vehicle, ovalbumin (OVA), or OVA + Z. seed oil (2 g/kg) for between 24 h and 14 days. Following treatment, inflammatory cell infiltration and pulmonary tissue damage were assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining, and immunohistochemistry. The expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules and mitogen activated protein kinase signaling proteins were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, reverse transcription quantitative-polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. In asthmatic mice, administration of Z. seed oil attenuated lung tissue injury and airway remodeling, and inhibited the infiltration of leukocytes and eosinophils into the airway by reducing the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines compared with OVA-treated mice (P&lt;0.05). Z. seed oil also reduced the levels of inflammatory chemokine and adhesion molecules via downregulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and activation of c-JUN N-terminal kinase in the Z. seed-treated mice compared with OVA-treated mice (P&lt;0.05). Thus, data from the present study indicates that Z. seed oil can suppress pulmonary inflammation and tissue injury during asthma, and suggests that it may be used to effectively treat allergen-induced asthma. 	z. seed oil pulmonary inflammation
2	Effect of the herbal medicine dai-kenchu-to on gastrointestinal motility in patients with megacystis-microcolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIHS) and chronic idiopathic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIIP): report of two cases.Dai-kenchu-to (DKT), a traditional Japanese herbal medicine (Kampo medicine), composed of zanthoxylum fruit, ginseng root, dried ginger rhizome and malt sugar, is clinically effective for postoperative ileus and chronic constipation. MMIHS and CIIP are severe motility disorder associated with high morbidity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of DKT on functional intestinal obstruction. DKT was clinically effective for gastrointestinal motility in a case with MMIHS, but not effective in one with CIIP. MMIHS and CIIP are speculated to have different pathogenesis regarding gastrointestinal pseudo-obstruction based upon the effect of this drug.	ginger gastrointestinal pseudo-obstruction
2	In vitro antimicrobial activity of extracts from plants used traditionally in South Africa to treat tuberculosis and related symptoms.Respiratory ailments are major human killers, especially in developing countries. Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease causing a threat to human healthcare. Many South African plants are used in the traditional treatment of TB and related symptoms, but there has not been a sufficient focus on evaluating their antimicrobial properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of plants used traditionally to treat TB and related symptoms against microorganisms (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Mycobacterium aurum A+) associated with respiratory infections using the microdilution assay. Ten plants were selected based on a survey of available literature of medicinal plants used in South Africa for the treatment of TB and related symptoms. The petroleum ether, dichloromethane, 80% ethanol, and water extracts of the selected plants were evaluated for antibacterial activity. Out of 68 extracts tested from different parts of the 10 plant species, 17 showed good antimicrobial activities against at least one or more of the microbial strains tested, with minimum inhibitory concentration ranging from 0.195 to 12.5 mg/mL. The good antimicrobial properties of Abrus precatorius, Terminalia phanerophlebia, Indigofera arrecta, and Pentanisia prunelloides authenticate their traditional use in the treatment of respiratory diseases. Thus, further pharmacological and phytochemical analysis is required.	terminalia phanerophlebia respiratory diseases
3	Chromium and polyphenols from cinnamon improve insulin sensitivity.Naturally-occurring compounds that have been shown to improve insulin sensitivity include Cr and polyphenols found in cinnamon (Cinnamomon cassia). These compounds also have similar effects on insulin signalling and glucose control. The signs of Cr deficiency are similar to those for the metabolic syndrome and supplemental Cr has been shown to improve all these signs in human subjects. In a double-blind placebo-controlled study it has been demonstrated that glucose, insulin, cholesterol and HbA1c are all improved in patients with type 2 diabetes following Cr supplementation. It has also been shown that cinnamon polyphenols improve insulin sensitivity in in vitro, animal and human studies. Cinnamon reduces mean fasting serum glucose (18-29%), TAG (23-30%), total cholesterol (12-26%) and LDL-cholesterol (7-27%) in subjects with type 2 diabetes after 40 d of daily consumption of 1-6 g cinnamon. Subjects with the metabolic syndrome who consume an aqueous extract of cinnamon have been shown to have improved fasting blood glucose, systolic blood pressure, percentage body fat and increased lean body mass compared with the placebo group. Studies utilizing an aqueous extract of cinnamon, high in type A polyphenols, have also demonstrated improvements in fasting glucose, glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in women with insulin resistance associated with the polycystic ovary syndrome. For both supplemental Cr and cinnamon not all studies have reported beneficial effects and the responses are related to the duration of the study, form of Cr or cinnamon used and the extent of obesity and glucose intolerance of the subjects.	polyphenols diabetes
1	Constituents of the root wood of Zanthoxylum wutaiense with antitubercular activity.Bioassay-guided fractionation of the root wood of Zanthoxylum wutaiense led to the isolation of 11 new compounds, wutaiensol methyl ether (1), demethoxywutaiensol methyl ether (2), methyl wutaiensate (3), methyl 7-hydroxyanodendroate (4), methyl 7-methoxyanodendroate (5), wutaifuranol (6), 7-methoxywutaifuranol (7), 7-methoxywutaifuranal (8), methyl wutaifuranate (9), methyl 7-methoxybenzofuran-5-carboxylate (10), and wutaipyranol (12), together with another 37 known compounds, of which one, 7-methoxybenzofuran-5-carboxaldehyde (11), was not previously known as a plant constituent. The structures of these isolates were identified by means of spectroscopic analysis. Five of these isolates were found to be antitubercular constituents, namely, methyl 7-methoxyanodendroate (5), 7-methoxywutaifuranal (8), wutaiensal (13), dictamnine (14), and gamma-fagarine (15), which exhibited antitubercular activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, showing MIC values of 35, 35, 30, 30, and 30 microg/mL, respectively.	zanthoxylum wutaiense methyl 7-methoxyanodendroate
1	Anthocyanins acylated with gallic acid from chenille plant, Acalypha hispida.Three anthocyanins were isolated from the red flowers of chenille plant, Acalypha hispida Burm. (Euphorbiaceae) by a combination of chromatographic techniques. Their structures were elucidated mainly by homo- and heteronuclear nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and electrospray mass spectrometry, and supported with complete assignments of 13C NMR resonances. The novel pigment, cyanidin 3-O-(2"-galloyl-6"-O-alpha-rhamnopyranosyl-beta-galactopyranoside) (5%), contains the disaccharide robinoside. The other anthocyanins were identified as cyanidin 3-O-(2"-galloyl-beta-galactopyranoside) (85%), and cyanidin 3-O-beta-galactopyranoside (5%). Anthocyanins acylated with gallic acid have previously been identified in species from the families Nymphaeaceae and Aceraceae, and tentatively in Abrus precatorius (Leguminosae).	abrus precatorius Anthocyanins

The explosion-puffed jujubes had the highest total gallic, p-hydroxybenzoic, vanillic, p-coumaric, ferulic acids, and rutin contents. Also, explosion-puffed jujubes contained a higher level of total phenolics and antioxidant activity than their counterparts. Among phenolic acid fractions in four forms, each form of phenolic acids in explosion-puffed jujubes had the most abundant content, followed by fresh and sun-dried jujubes. The glycosided and insoluble-bound phenolic acid fractions for each sample represented the highest TPC and the strongest antioxidant activity. The results indicated explosion puffing was a good choice for jujube processing.	jujube phenolic acid
3	2-hydroxycinnamaldehyde inhibits SW620 colon cancer cell growth through AP-1 inactivation.Cinnamaldehyde derivatives isolated from Cinnamomum cassia have been widely used for treating dyspepsia, gastritis, and inflammatory disease as well as cancer. To investigate the anti-tumor activities of several cinnamaldehyde derivatives, we compared the inhibitory effect of cinnamaldehyde derivatives on cell growth and AP-1 transcriptional activity in SW620 human colon cancer cells since AP-1 is a transcriptional factor implicated to control cancer cell growth. Among the derivatives, 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (HCA) most significantly inhibited cancer cell growth and AP-1 transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 12.5 and 9 microg/ml, respectively. In further studies on the mechanism, we found that consistent with the inhibitory effect on cell growth, HCA dose-dependently (0-20 microg/ml) inhibited DNA binding activity of AP-1 accompanied with down regulation of c-Jun and c-Fos expressions. HCA also induced apoptotic cell death as well as expression of the apoptosis-regulating gene caspase-3, but inhibited the anti-apoptosis regulating gene bcl-2 in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggested that HCA has the most potent inhibitory effect against human colon cancer cell growth, and AP-1 may be an important target of HCA.	cinnamaldehyde colon cancer

(Rutaceae) or Ma-khwaen is one of the medicinal plants in Thai traditional medicine. To investigate the pharmacognostic specifications and chemical constituents of Z. limonella fruits and seeds. Fruits and seeds of Z. limonella were collected from 15 sources throughout Thailand; then examined the pharmacognostic specification following WHO guideline of quality control method for medicinal plant materials. Microscopic determination of Z. limonella powders demonstrated fragment of mesocarp, fragment of brown vitta, oil glands, fragment of endocarp, and endosperm containing oil globule, trichome and pale brown stone cells. Stomatal index and pellucid dots in mm2 were 19.87 and 4.2 respectively. Physico-chemical parameters unveiled that loss on drying, water content, total ash, and acid-insoluble ash should be not &gt;17.90%, 9.18%, 4.50%, and 0.60% of dried weight respectively; while ethanol, water, and hexane extractive values and volatile oil content should be not &lt;2.24%, 2.27%, 1.57% and 9.63% of dried weight respectively. Rf values of thin-layer chromatographic fingerprint of Z. limonella fruits and seeds ethanolic extract were 0.38, 0.45, 0.90, and 0.97 detected ultraviolet (UV) light 254 nm, 0.30, 0.44, 0.67, and 0.77 detected UV light 366 nm, and 0.24, 0.73, 0.78, and 0.93 detected 10% sulfuric acid. There are three main chemical compounds in Z. limonella oil including limonene (43.63%), (+)-sabinene (16.72%), and terpinen-4-ol (10.95%). The result gained from pharmacognostic specifications and chemical fingerprints could be used as standardization data of Z. limonella fruits and seeds to apply or provide for guarantee of quality.	z. limonella limonella oil
1	Antioxidant capacity and total phenolic contents in hydrophilic extracts of selected Bangladeshi medicinal plants.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate hydrophilic extracts from edible portions of fifteen plants for total phenolic content (TPC) and anti-oxidant capacity (AC) as an effort to find possible sources for future novel antioxidants. METHODS: Folin-Ciocalteau and DPPH radical scavenging assays were employed to determine TPC and AC, respectively. RESULTS: Among the assayed plants, TPC (mean+-SD), expressed as gallic acid equivalent, varied from 0.04+-0.01 (Amaranthus spinosus) to 6.01+-0.04 (Zanthoxylum rhetsa) mg gallic acid equivalent/g fresh weight. AC (mean+-SD), expressed as trolox equivalent, ranged from 0.14+-0.00 (Alternanthera philoxeroides) to 7.54+-0.00 (Zanthoxylum rhetsa) mumol trolox equivalent/g fresh weight. A significant and positive linear relationship (R(2)=0.99) was observed between TPC and AC of Zanthoxylum rhetsa, Oxalis corymbosa, and Alternanthera sessilis. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study implies that the analyzed plants possess varying degree of antioxidant capacity and, therefore, the antioxidant potency of these underused plants may be utilized to prevent oxidative damage and oxidative stress related disorders.	amaranthus spinosus gallic acid

1	Optimization of the extraction conditions and quantification by RP-LC analysis of three alkaloids in Zanthoxylum nitidum roots.CONTEXT: A classic traditional Chinese medicine, Zanthoxylum nitidum (Roxb.) DC. widely used in China, exhibits anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antianalgesic activities. Alkaloids are one of the main bioactive components. It is urgent to develop a simple and reliable method to determine the main alkaloids in Z. nitidum roots. OBJECTIVE: To determine the three alkaloids in Z. nitidum roots, a reversed-phase liquid chromatographic (RP-LC) method combined with an optimum extraction condition was established. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A method involving four-factor-three-level orthogonal array design including the extracting solvent and the RP-LC condition was assayed. Twenty batches were collected from different areas of the Guangxi Province at different harvesting times. The determined alkaloids were nitidine chloride (NC, 1), ethoxychelerythrine (2) and liriodenine (3). The stable mobile phase was a C18 packing, and the mobile phase was acetonitril-aqueous phosphoric acid-triethylamine-buffer solution. RESULTS: The optimum extraction and detection conditions have been determined in the process of quantification of Z. nitidum root alkaloids. The three alkaloids were detected simultaneously in the 20 batches of samples. The results clearly showed that alkaloid concentrations differed significantly among Z. nitidum collected from various collection areas. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: We have established an optimum extraction and detection conditions in the process of quantification the three alkaloids in Z. nitidum roots. From this research, the most influenced factor on Z. nitidum roots was the collecting location, and the next factor was the harvesting time. The collecting location and the harvesting time should be considered as the high-quality medicinal herbs factors.	z. nitidum alkaloids

2	Dynamic changes of flavonoids in Abelmoschus manihot different organs at different growth periods by UPLC-MS/MS.Abelmoschus manihot (Linn.) Medicus has been clinically used to treat chronic kidney disease, oral ulcers, burns, and dysmenorrhea in China for many centuries. The major pharmacologically-active components of A. manihot are flavonoids. In this study, a rapid and highly sensitive UPLC-MS/MS analysis method was established and successfully applied to the simultaneous determination of five major flavonoids (rutin, hyperoside, isoquercitrin, quercetin, and myricetin) in different parts of A. manihot harvested at ten growth periods. Under the optimized chromatographic conditions, good separation for five target components was obtained on an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column within 18min. The total contents of the five investigated flavonoids in A. manihot roots, stems, leaves and flowers ranged from 2.86 to 123.7mug/g, 46.39 to 141.0mug/g, 929.4 to 3096mug/g, and 10,150 to 19,390mug/g, respectively, indicating that the total flavonoids in the four parts could be mainly arranged in a decreasing order as flower&gt;leaf&gt;stem&gt;root. The peak of total flavonoids in flowers and leaves appeared at G8 and G9, respectively. These results will be helpful for the determination of the suitable harvest time of A. manihot and the improvement of the utility value of the disused parts.	a. manihot kidney disease
2	Zanthoxylum schinifolium leaf ethanol extract inhibits adipocyte differentiation through inactivation of the extracellular signal regulated kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathways in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes.Zanthoxylum schinifolium is widely used as a food flavoring in east Asia. Although this plant has also been used in traditional oriental medicine for the treatment of the common cold, toothache, stomach ache, diarrhea and jaundice, its anti-obesity activity remains to be elucidated. The present study investigated the effects of ethanol extract from the leaves of Z. schinifolium (EEZS) on adipocyte differentiation, and its underlying mechanism, in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes. The results demonstrated that EEZS effectively suppressed intracellular lipid accumulation at non-toxic concentrations, and was associated with the downregulation of several adipocyte-specific transcription factors, including peroxisome proliferation-activity receptor gamma (PPARgamma), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP)alpha and C/EBPbeta, in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, it was observed that EEZS markedly inactivated the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways, which act upstream of PPARgamma and C/EBPs in adipogenesis. These results suggested that EEZS inhibited lipid accumulation by downregulating the major transcription factors involved in the pathway of adipogenesis, including PPARgamma, C/EBPalpha and C/EBPbeta, via regulation of the ERK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways in 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. This indicated the potential use of EEZS as an anti-obesity agent.	z. schinifolium obesity

1	Comparison of the sedative and hypnotic effects of flavonoids, saponins, and polysaccharides extracted from Semen Ziziphus jujube.Semen Ziziphus jujube (SZJ), the seeds of Ziziphus jujuba Mill. var. spinosa, is a kind of traditional Chinese medicine used for its action on insomnia. In order to analyze the effective component, we investigated and compared the sedative and hypnotic effects of three kinds of compounds, flavonoids, saponins, and polysaccharides. Flavonoids, saponins, and polysaccharides were extracted from SZJ and orally administered to mice separately at 17 g kg(-1) per day for certain days before animal tests. Spontaneous motility and coordinated movement tests were used to observe the effects of the three kinds of compounds on the mouse behavior, and sodium barbital-induced sleeping time of mouse were tested to analyze the effects of the three kinds of compounds on the sleep of mouse. Results show that flavonoids and saponins caused a significant reduction of walking time and coordinated movement ability of mouse, significantly prolonged its sleeping time at 40 mg kg(-1), ip, subthreshold dose and increased the sleeping number of animals at 50 mg kg(-1), ip, superthreshold dose induced by coeliac injection of sodium barbital. Polysaccharides did not show any significance in all animal tests. Comparative analysis showed that saponins had a more effective sedative and hypnotic function than that of flavonoids, polysaccharides did not show a sedative and hypnotic effect.	ziziphus jujuba mill. var polysaccharides
1	Analysis of volatile components, fatty acids, and phytosterols of Abies koreana growing in Poland.Extracts and essential oils from seeds as well as essential oils from cone scales and needles with twigs of the Abies koreana population were studied. An analysis of Korean fir essential oils allowed us to determine 147 volatile compounds. The identified compounds constituted 97-99% of the seed, cone and needle oils. The main volatile in the seed and needle oils was limonene (56.6% and 23.4%, respectively), while the predominant volatile in cone oils was alpha-pinene (51.2%). Korean fir seeds provided a rich source of both essential oil (3.8-8.5%) and extract, which was isolated with a 24.5% yield and contained numerous groups of fatty acids and phytosterols (414 microg/100g extract). The most prominent fatty acids were unsaturated, among which linoleic (41.2%) and oleic (31.2%) fatty acid were the main ones while the dominant sterols were isomers of ergostadienol and beta-sitosterol. A. koreana seeds, cones and needles are a source of many volatile bioactive compounds while the seed extract, with a pleasant scent, contained not only volatiles, but also fractions rich in fatty acids and phytosterols. These facts make A. koreana essential oils and especially the seed extract potential components of cosmetics.	a. koreana essential oils
1	Separation of polyprenyl phosphate oligomerhomologues by reversed-phase ion-pair high-performance liquid chromatography.A simple and rapid method of reversed-phase ion-pair high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV-detection on a common C(18) column in an isocratic mode with the addition of tetrabutylammonium phosphate for the separation of polyprenyl phosphate oligomerhomologues has been developed.  The method was successfully applied to assay the composition of polyprenyl phosphates obtained from polyprenols isolated from mulberry (Morus alba) leaves and fir (Abies sibirica) needles (the active components of veterinary drugs Gamapren and Phosprenyl correspondingly).	morus alba Phosprenyl
1	Formulation, physicochemical characterization, and in vitro study of chitosan/HPMC blends-based herbal blended patches.The current work prepared chitosan/hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) blends and studied the possibility of chitosan/HPMC blended patches for Zingiber cassumunar Roxb. The blended patches without/with crude Z. cassumunar oil were prepared by homogeneously mixing the 3.5% w/v of chitosan solution and 20% w/v of HPMC solution, and glycerine was used as plasticizer. Then, they were poured into Petri dish and produced the blended patches in hot air oven at 70 +- 2 C. The blended patches were tested and evaluated by the physicochemical properties: moisture uptake, swelling ratio, erosion, porosity, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and X-ray diffraction, and photographed the surface and cross-section morphology under SEM technique. Herbal blended patches were studied by the in vitro release and skin permeation of active compound D. The blended patches could absorb the moisture and became hydrated patches that occurred during the swelling of blended patches. They were eroded and increased by the number of porous channels to pass through out for active compound D. In addition, the blended patches indicated the compatibility of the blended ingredients and homogeneous smooth and compact. The blended patches made from chitosan/HPMC blends provide a controlled release and skin permeation behavior of compound D. Thus, the blended patches could be suitably used for herbal medicine application.	zingiber cassumunar roxb hydroxypropyl methylcellulose
1	Anti-Inflammatory Activities of Cinnamomum cassia Constituents In Vitro and In Vivo.We have investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of Cinnamomum cassia constituents (cinnamic aldehyde, cinnamic alcohol, cinnamic acid, and coumarin) using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated mouse macrophage (RAW264.7) and carrageenan (Carr)-induced mouse paw edema model. When RAW264.7 macrophages were treated with cinnamic aldehyde together with LPS, a significant concentration-dependent inhibition of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE(2)) levels productions were detected. Western blotting revealed that cinnamic aldehyde blocked protein expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), and IkappaBalpha, significantly. In the anti-inflammatory test, cinnamic aldehyde decreased the paw edema after Carr administration, and increased the activities of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in the paw tissue. We also demonstrated cinnamic aldehyde attenuated the malondialdehyde (MDA) level and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in the edema paw after Carr injection. Cinnamic aldehyde decreased the NO, TNF-alpha, and PGE(2) levels on the serum level after Carr injection. Western blotting revealed that cinnamic aldehyde decreased Carr-induced iNOS, COX-2, and NF-kappaB expressions in the edema paw. These findings demonstrated that cinnamic aldehyde has excellent anti-inflammatory activities and thus has great potential to be used as a source for natural health products.	cinnamomum cassia cinnamic aldehyde
2	Protective effects of long-term administration of Ziziphus jujuba fruit extract on cardiovascular responses in L-NAME hypertensive rats.Objective: Ziziphus jujuba stimulates the release of nitric oxide (NO). Because NO is involved in cardiovascular regulations, in this study the effects of hydroalcoholic extract of Z. jujuba on cardiovascular responses in acute NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) hypertensive rats were evaluated. Materials and Methods: Rats were divided into 6 group (n=6): 1) saline, 2) L-NAME received (10mg/kg) intravenously, 3) sodium nitroprusside (SNP) (50microg/kg)+L-NAME group received SNP before L-NAME and 4-6) three groups of Z. jujuba (100, 200 and 400mg/kg) that treated for four weeks and on the 28th day, L-NAME was injected. Femoral artery and vein were cannulated for recording cardiovascular responses and drug injection, respectively. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were recorded continuously. Maximal changes ( ) of SBP, MAP and HR were calculated and compared to control and L-NAME groups. Results: In L-NAME group, maximal DeltaSBP (L-NAME: 44.15+-4.0 mmHg vs control: 0.71+-2.1 mmHg) and DeltaMAP (L-NAME: 40.8+-4.0 mmHg vs control: 0.57+-1.6 mmHg) significantly increased (p&lt;0.001 in both) but  HR was not significant as compared to control (p&gt;0.05). All doses of Z. jujuba attenuated maximal  SBP and  MAP induced by L-NAME but only the lowest dose (100 mg/kg) had significant effects (DeltaSBP: 20.36+-5.6 mmHg vs L-NAME: 44.1+-4.0 mmHg and DeltaMAP: 20.8+-4.5 mmHg vs L-NAME: 40.8+-3.8 mmHg (p&lt;0.05 to p&lt;0.01)). The  HR at three doses was not significantly different from that of L-NAME group (p&gt;0.05). Conclusion: Because long-term consumption of Z. jujuba extract, especially its lowest dose, attenuated cardiovascular responses induced by L-NAME, we suggest that Z. jujuba has potential beneficial effects in prevention of hypertension induced by NO deficiency.	z. jujuba hypertension
2	"Ziziphus jujuba": A red fruit with promising anticancer activities.Ziziphus jujuba Mill. (Z. jujuba) is a traditional herb with a long history of use for nutrition and the treatment of a broad spectrum of diseases. It grows mostly in South and East Asia, as well as in Australia and Europe. Mounting evidence shows the health benefits of Z. jujuba, including anticancer, anti-inflammation, antiobesity, antioxidant, and hepato- and gastrointestinal protective properties, which are due to its bioactive compounds. Chemotherapy, such as with cis-diamminedichloroplatinium (CDDP, cisplatin) and its derivatives, is widely used in cancer treatment. It is an effective treatment for human cancers, including ovarian cancer; however, drug resistance is a major obstacle to successful treatment. A better understanding of the mechanisms and strategies for overcoming chemoresistance can greatly improve therapeutic outcomes for patients. In this review article, the bioactive compounds present in Z. jujuba are explained. The high prevalence of many different cancers worldwide has recently attracted the attention of many researchers. This is why our research group focused on studying the anticancer activity of Z. jujuba as well as its impact on chemoresistance both in vivo and in vitro. We hope that these studies can lead to a promising future for cancer patients. 	z. jujuba cancer
2	The suppressive effects of gx-50 on Abeta-induced chemotactic migration of microglia.Microglia, the main immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), play a vital role in the development of AD. Once microglia are activated, they migrate to neuritic plaques and persistently release pro-inflammatory mediators that lead to neuroinflammation and neuronal degeneration, accelerating the progression of AD. In this study, we analyzed whether an AD candidate drug, N-[2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethyl]-3-phenyl-acrylamide (gx-50), a compound extracted from Sichuan pepper (Zanthoxylum bungeanum), exhibited suppressive effects on the chemotactic migration of microglia induced by Abeta. At first, the effects of gx-50 on the migration of primary cultured microglia to Abeta were detected by transwell assay, and the secretion of chemokine CCL5 was measured by ELISA assay. Then, the release of TGF-beta1 was detected by ELISA and quantitative real-time PCR, and the activation of the TGF-beta1-Smad2 pathway was analyzed by Western blotting. The LDH assay revealed that cell viability was not affected by gx-50 at concentrations from 0.01 to 100 muM; thus, combined with our previous studies, 1 muM was chosen as the treatment concentration. The cell transwell measurement demonstrated that gx-50 suppressed the chemotactic migration of microglia by nearly 50% and inhibited the increase in CCL5 triggered by Abeta. Moreover, the analysis of the TGF-beta1-Smad2 pathway revealed that gx-50 can antagonize Abeta-induced down-regulation of TGF-beta1 at both the mRNA and protein levels and stimulate the signal pathway activation. Simultaneously, gx-50 pretreatment also significantly enhanced the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), which correlated closely with the migration of microglia. In conclusion, in the presence of Abeta, gx-50 pretreatment inhibited the excessive chemotactic migration of microglia.	zanthoxylum bungeanum AD
1	Extraction time and temperature affect the extraction efficiencies of coumarin and phenylpropanoids from Cinnamomum cassia bark using a microwave-assisted extraction method.Microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), an efficient extraction tool, was employed to extract a coumarin and five phenylpropanoids (cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, cinnamaldehyde, 2-hydroxycinnamadehyde, and 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde) from Cinnamomum cassia bark using water as the extraction solvent. Six marker compounds were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector using a validated analytical method. To investigate the influences of temperature and time on the extraction yields of the six marker compounds, the water extracts of C. cassia bark were prepared using a MAE method at six different extraction temperatures (70, 75, 80, 85, 90, and 95 C) and times (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12min). Their influences were assessed by multiple regression analysis. The results obtained demonstrated that higher extraction temperature and longer extraction time positively affected coumarin and cinnamyl alcohol contents, but negatively affected extract contents of cinnamic acid, cinnamaldehyde and 2-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (all p-&lt;0.05). The extraction of 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde was affected by both positively and negatively by increasing temperature and time. These changes during MAE were assumed by the chemical natures of the marker compounds with various functional groups. In conclusion, temperature and times significantly affected the extraction efficiencies of a coumarin and five phenylpropanoids from C. cassia bark when a water-based MAE method was used. This study provides a novel approach to the preparation of the water extract of C. cassia bark using MAE.	c. cassia coumarin
1	Linalool Affects the Antimicrobial Efficacy of Essential Oils.The high concentrations of essential oils are generally required to receive microbial purity of the products (cosmetics, medicine). On the other hand, their application due to the high concentration of essential oils may be limited by changes in organoleptic and textural quality of the products, as well as they cause irritation and allergies in users. Addition of linalool to essential oil may significantly enhance its antimicrobial effectiveness and reduce their concentrations in products, taking advantage of their synergistic and additive effects. The aim of the study was to compare antimicrobial activity of essential oil alone and in combination with linalool. The antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Thymus vulgaris, Juniperus communis, Pelargonium graveolens, Citrus bergamia, Citrus grandis, Lavandula angustifolia, Cinnamomum zeylanicum, Melaleuca alternifolia, Syzygium aromaticum, linalool and their combination was investigated against bacteria and fungi using the disc diffusion method. The addition of linalool to S. aromaticum oil in a synergistic manner enhanced its antimicrobial efficacy against P. aeruginosa and A. brasiliensis. Moreover, the additive interaction between this oil and linalool was observed against S. aureus, E. coli and C. albicans. It was also found that linalool in an additive manner increased the antimicrobial effectiveness of T. vulgaris oil against P. aeruginosa. The antimicrobial properties of mixture of essential oils with their active constituents may be used for creating new strategies to maintain microbiological purity of products. 	melaleuca alternifolia linalool
2	Huangkui capsule, an extract from Abelmoschus manihot (L.) medic, ameliorates adriamycin-induced renal inflammation and glomerular injury via inhibiting p38MAPK signaling pathway activity in rats.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Abelmoschus manihot (L.) medic (AM) is a natural medicinal plant used for the treatment of inflammatory diseases in China. Huangkui capsule (HKC), an extract from AM, has been proved clinically effective in improving renal inflammation and glomerular injury in chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the dose-effects and the mechanisms involved in vivo are still unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study was performed to examine the dose-effects of HKC on renal inflammation and glomerular lesion in adriamycin-induced nephropathy (ADRN), then to clarify the mechanisms in vivo of HKC by investigating its actions on modulating the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) signaling pathway. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The rats with chronic ADRN, created by the unilateral nephrectomy and twice adriamycin injections (ADR, 4 mg/kg and 2mg/kg) within 4 weeks, were divided into four groups, a Sham group, a Vehicle group, a high-dose HKC group, and a low-dose HKC group, and that, sacrificed at the end of the 4th week after the administration. The rat's general status, renal morphological appearance, proteinuria, blood biochemical parameters, glomerular morphological changes, podocyte shape, and macrophage (ED1(+) and ED3(+) cells) infiltration in glomeruli were examined, respectively. The protein expressions of inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-2, as well as p38MAPK signaling molecules such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, p38MAPK, and phosphorylated-p38MAPK (p-p38MAPK), were also evaluated individually. RESULTS: HKC at high dose of 2g/kg/d not only significantly ameliorated the rat's general status, renal morphological appearance, proteinuria, albumin, and glomerulosclerosis, but also obviously reduced the infiltrated ED1(+) and ED3(+) macrophages in glomeruli and TNF-alpha protein expression in the kidney, in addition to these, evidently down-regulated TGF-beta1 and p-p38MAPK protein expressions in ADRN rats, but had no influence on podocyte shape and renal function. CONCLUSION: HKC could dose-dependently ameliorate renal inflammation and glomerular injury in ADRN rats, by way of reducing the infiltration and the activation of macrophages in glomeruli, and TNF-alpha protein expression in the kidney, as well as inhibiting p38MAPK signaling pathway activity via the down-regulation of p-p38MAPK and TGF-beta1 protein expressions in vivo.	abelmoschus manihot glomerular injury
1	Components and insecticidal activity against the maize weevils of Zanthoxylum schinifolium fruits and leaves.In our screening program for new agrochemicals from Chinese medicinal herbs and wild plants, Zanthoxylum schinifolium essential oils were found to possess strong insecticidal activity against the maize weevil Sitophilus zeamais. The essential oils of Z. schinifolium fruits and leaves were extracted via hydrodistillation and investigated by GC and GC-MS. Estragole (69.52%) was the major compound of the essential oil of fresh fruits, followed by linalool (8.63%) and limonene (4.34%) and 94.33% of the total components were monoterpenoids. The main components of the essential oil of fresh leaves were linalool (12.94%), ar-tumerone (8.95%), limonene (6.45%) and elixene (5.43%) and only 50.62% were monoterpenoids. However, the essential oil from purchased fruits contained linalool (33.42%), limonene (13.66%) and sabinene (5.72%), followed by estragole (4.67%), nerol (4.56%) and 4-terpineol (4.27%). Estragole, linalool and sabinene were separated and purified by silica gel column chromatography and preparative thin layer chromatography, and further identified by means of physicochemical and spectrometric analysis. The essential oil from the fresh fruits (LD50 = 15.93 mug/adult) possessed two times more toxicity to the insects compared with that of fresh leaves (LD50 = 35.31 mug/adult). Estragole, linalool and sabinene exhibited contact activity against S. zeamais with LD50 values of 17.63, 13.90 and 23.98 mug/adult, respectively. The essential oils of Z. schinifolium possessed strong fumigant toxicity against S. zeamais adults with LC50 values of 13.19 mg/L (fresh fruits), 24.04 mg/L (fresh leaves) and 17.63 mg/L (purchased fruits). Estragole, linalool and sabinene also exhibited strong fumigant toxicity against the maize weevils with LC50 values of 14.10, 10.46 and 9.12 mg/L, respectively.	maize weevils limonene
2	An herbal formula attenuates collagen-induced arthritis via inhibition of JAK2-STAT3 signaling and regulation of Th17 cells in mice.Wenjinghuoluo prescription, a traditional Chinese medicine compound treatment of rheumatoid arthritis characterized by wind-cold-dampness arthralgia, contains five herbs, namely, C. cassia Presl., Cinnamomum cassia Presl., Paeonia lactiflora Pall., Saposhnikovia divaricate (Turcz.) Schischk., and Clematis chinensis Osbeck. We have reported that WJHL could inhibit the production of inflammatory mediators in immune cells. This study explored the effect and mechanism of WJHL on collagen-induced arthritis mice. WJHL could significantly improve clinical arthritic conditions; inhibit bone erosion and osteophyte formation in joints; decrease expression of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-17); reduce protein expression levels of JAK2, p-JAK2, STAT3, p-STAT3 and gene expression levels of JAK2, STAT3, IL-17A, RORgammat mRNA; elevate osteoprotegerin and Foxp3 mRNA levels and lower Th17 cell proportions in splenocytes. Results suggest that WJHL, specifically regulating the JAK2/STAT3 pathway and Th17 cells, may be a promising herbal medicine candidate for the treatment of RA.	clematis chinensis osbeck RA
0	Antiproliferative activity of trans-avicennol from Zanthoxylum chiloperone var. angustifolium against human cancer stem cells.Zanthoxylum chiloperone var. angustifolium root bark was studied with the aim of finding novel molecules able to overcome cancer stem cell chemoresistance. Purification of a methanol-soluble extract resulted in the isolation of a known pyranocoumarin, trans-avicennol (1). Compound 1 demonstrated antiproliferative activity on glioma-initiating cells, whereas it was inactive on human neural stem cells. trans-Avicennol (1) activated the MAPK/ERK pathway and was also evaluated for its ability to inhibit the enzyme indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase.	trans-Avicennol ERK
1	Protective effect of cinnamaldehyde against glutamate-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in PC12 cells.Cinnamaldehyde is a main ingredient of cinnamon oils from the stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia, which has been widely used in food and traditional herbal medicine in Asia. In the present study, the neuroprotective effects and the potential mechanisms of cinnamaldehyde against glutamate-induced oxidative stress in PC12 cells were investigated. Exposure to 4mM glutamate altered the GSH, MDA levels and SOD activity, caused the generation of reactive oxygen species, resulted in the induction of oxidative stress in PC12 cell, ultimately induced cell death. However, pretreatment with cinnamaldehyde at 5, 10 and 20muM significantly attenuated cell viability loss, reduced the generation of reactive oxygen species, stabilised mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), decreased the release of cytochrome c and limited the activities of caspase-9 and -3. In addition, cinnamaldehyde also markedly increased Bcl-2 while inhibiting Bax expression,and decreased the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio. These results indicate that cinnamaldehyde exists a potential protective effect against glutamate-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in PC12 cells.	cinnamomum cassia cinnamaldehyde
1	Constituents of the essential oil of the Cinnamomum cassia stem bark and the biological properties.GC-MS analysis on the essential oil (CC-oil) of Cinnamomum cassia stem bark led to the identification of cinnamaldehyde (CNA, 1), 2-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (2-CNA), coumarin (2), and cinnamyl acetate. The major volatile flavor in CC-oil was found to be 2-CNA. Coumarin was first isolated from this plant by phytochemical isolation and spectroscopic analysis. CNA and CC-oil showed potent cytotoxicity, which was effectively prevented by N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) treatment. Intraperitoneal administration with CNA considerably decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) formation and glutathione S-transferase activity in rats. These results suggest that CC-oil and CNA can regulate the triggering of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes by the formation of a glutathione-conjugate.	cinnamomum cassia CNA
3	Phytochemicals of Cinnamomi Cortex: Cinnamic Acid, but not Cinnamaldehyde, Attenuates Oxaliplatin-Induced Cold and Mechanical Hypersensitivity in Rats.A chemotherapy drug, oxaliplatin, induces cold and mechanical hypersensitivity, but effective treatments for this neuropathic pain without side effects are still lacking. We previously showed that Cinnamomi Cortex suppresses oxaliplatin-induced pain behaviors in rats. However, it remains unknown which phytochemical of Cinnamomi Cortex plays a key role in that analgesic action. Thus, here we investigated whether and how cinnamic acid or cinnamaldehyde, major components of Cinnamomi Cortex, alleviates cold and mechanical allodynia induced by a single oxaliplatin injection (6 mg/kg, i.p.) in rats. Using an acetone test and the von Frey test for measuring cold and mechanical allodynia, respectively, we found that administration of cinnamic acid, but not cinnamaldehyde, at doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg (i.p.) significantly attenuates the allodynic behaviors in oxaliplatin-injected rats with the strongest effect being observed at 20 mg/kg. Our in vivo extracellular recordings also showed that cinnamic acid (20 mg/kg, i.p.) inhibits the increased activities of spinal wide dynamic range neurons in response to cutaneous mechanical and cold stimuli following the oxaliplatin injection. These results indicate that cinnamic acid has an effective analgesic action against oxaliplatin-induced neuropathic pain through inhibiting spinal pain transmission, suggesting its crucial role in mediating the effect of Cinnamomi Cortex.	cinnamic acid hypersensitivity,
1	Simultaneous qualitative and quantitative analysis of triterpenic acids, saponins and flavonoids in the leaves of two Ziziphus species by HPLC-PDA-MS/ELSD.The leaves of Ziziphus jujuba and Z. jujuba var. spinosa have been utilized as crude drugs for their health benefits in China for thousands of years. To control their quality, a reliable method based on high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with photo diode array and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry detection (HPLC-PDA-ESI-MS/MS) was developed for exploration of the chemical profiles of these jujube leaves. As the results, fourteen constituents including three flavonoids, two saponins and nine triterpenic acids were identified or tentatively characterized. Then, twelve of them such as quercetin-3-O-rutinoside, zizyphus saponins I and II, ceanothic acid, alphitolic acid, maslinic acid, 2alpha-hydroxyursolic acid, zizyberanalic acid, epiceanothic acid, ceanothenic acid, betulinic acid, and oleanolic acid were selected as the chemical markers and were determined using an HPLC coupled with evaporative light scattering detection (ELSD) method. The separation was carried out on a Waters Sunfire C18 column with 0.2 % acetic acid and acetonitrile as the mobile phase under gradient elution. The operating conditions of ELSD were set as 80 C for drift tube temperature and 2.7 l/min for nitrogen flow rate. The developed method was fully validated in terms of linearity, sensitivity, precision, repeatability as well as recovery, and subsequently applied to evaluate the quality of eight batches of Z. jujuba and Z. jujuba var. spinosa leaves from different collections.	z. jujuba var saponins
1	Chemical and biological assessment of Ziziphus jujuba fruits from China: different geographical sources and developmental stages.Chinese date, the fruit of Ziziphus jujuba Mill., has thousands of years cultivation history, and about 700 cultivars of dates in China. Two types of dates are commonly found in the market: (i) fresh immature dates consumed as fruits, and (ii) dried mature dates used as Chinese medicines. Here, chemical and biological properties of these dates were revealed. Different sources of dates showed similar chemical profiles; however, the amounts of identified chemicals showed a great variation. The amount of nucleotides, flavonoids and polysaccharides in dates could be affected by its maturity and drying process. In parallel, the antioxidative functions of their extracts were compared. The date extracts protected PC12 cells against tBHP-induced cytotoxicity, and which also stimulated the transcriptional activity of antioxidant response element. The antioxidative effects were varied among different dates. The current results suggested the optimization of sources and specific usage of different maturity dates. 	ziziphus jujuba mill polysaccharides
1	Structural motifs of syringyl peroxidases predate not only the gymnosperm-angiosperm divergence but also the radiation of tracheophytes.* The most distinctive variation in the monomer composition of lignins in vascular land plants is that found between the two main groups of seed plants. Thus, while gymnosperm lignins are typically composed of guaiacyl (G) units, angiosperm lignins are largely composed of similar levels of G and syringyl (S) units. * However, and contrary to what might be expected, peroxidases isolated from basal (Cycadales and Ginkgoales) and differentially evolved (Coniferales and Gnetales) gymnosperms are also able to oxidize S moieties, and this ability is independent of the presence or absence of S-type units in their lignins. * The results obtained led us to look at the protein database to search for homologies between gymnosperm peroxidases and true eudicot S-peroxidases, such as the Zinnia elegans peroxidase. * The findings showed that certain structural motifs characteristic of eudicot S-peroxidases (certain amino acid sequences and beta-sheet secondary structures) predate the gymnosperm-angiosperm divergence and the radiation of tracheophytes, since they are found not only in peroxidases from basal gymnosperms, ferns and lycopods, but also in peroxidases from the moss Physcomitrella patens (Bryopsida) and the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha (Marchantiopsida), which, as typical of bryophytes, do not have xylem tissue nor lignins.	zinnia elegans lignins
1	Studies on the effects of essential-oil-based feed additives on performance, ileal nutrient digestibility, and selected bacterial groups in the gastrointestinal tract of piglets.The aim of this study was to assess the effects of 2 different phytogenic products on performance, ileal nutrient digestibility, and composition of the intestinal microbiota. The 2 phytogenic products contained different essential oil mixtures (EOM) characterized by either menthol (Mentha arvensis; EOM-M) or cinnamon aldehyde (Cinnamomum aromaticum; EOM-C) as main constituents. Three treatments consisted of control diet without EOM addition and diets supplemented with EOM-M or EOM-C. Reproducibility of the effects was examined in 4 trials with a total of 300 male castrated and female piglets weaned at 25 d of age. The number of pens per treatment in trials I through III were 7, 9, and 9, respectively, for research station conditions, and 10 in trial IV for simulated farm conditions. In research station conditions, the experimental unit consisted of flat deck pens with 2 piglets per pen, whereas it consisted of floor pens with straw bedding with 5 piglets per pen in farm conditions. The feed additives had no effect on feed intake or BW gain. Improvements (P &lt; 0.05) in G:F were observed for EOM-M supplemented diets in 2 of 4 trials as well as for the combined data of all trials. These improvements were associated with greater (P&lt;0.05) apparent ileal digestibility of CP and of most AA. The effect of EOM-C on these response criteria was intermediate between control and EOM-M. Real-time PCR analysis of the gastrointestinal contents for 7 bacterial groups (Lactobacillus spp., Enterococcus spp., Clostridium coccoides and Clostridium leptum cluster, Escherichia spp., and Escherichia coli toxin estII) indicated no effect of treatments on the gastrointestinal microbiota. It was concluded that EOM-M consistently improved feed efficiency in weaned piglets, and it was associated with improved ileal protein and AA digestibility. In general, however, the effectiveness of EOM as feed additives differs considerably depending on the constituents.	clostridium leptum essential oil
3	New polyunsaturated fatty acid amides isolated from the seeds of Zanthoxylum piperitum.Five linear fatty acid amides (1-5) of the sandshool class, including two new compounds, were isolated from Zanthoxylum piperitum seeds. Based on combined spectral analyses, the structures of new compounds 4 and 5 were determined to be 2',3'-dihydroxy-alpha-sanshool and 2',3'-dihydroxy-beta-sanshool, respectively. These compounds exhibited weak cytotoxicity in the A-549 (human lung cancer) cell line.	2',3'-dihydroxy-alpha-sanshool lung cancer
2	In vivo effect of some home spices extracts on the toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites.Toxoplasmosis drugs have the longest history and are still the first choice for most conditions. Alternative drugs such as Co-trimoxazole and Tetracycline have been tried and acclaimed successful. The lack of general acceptance, however, is an indication that the results are not very convincing. A wide range of antibiotics is urgently needed for patients with drug reaction or resistance problems. The anti-toxoplasmic activity of water and ethanol extracts as well as the oil of some home spices (Piper nigrum, Capsicum frutescens, Cinnamomum cassia and Curcuma longa), were evaluated in murine models of intraperitoneal infection using the RH strain of Toxoplasma gondii. Female mice were infected with 2x10(2) tachyzoites/ml, and then treated intraperitoneally with the home spices at 100 and 200 mg/kg/day for seven days. The tested extracts reduced the mean number of tachyzoites present in the peritoneal fluid of the experimental mice. The most effective extract was Curcuma longa ethanol extract which showed a 98.6% and 99.2% inhibition of the growth of Toxoplasma tachyzoites in 100 and 200 doses respectively compared to the control infected untreated mice.	curcuma longa toxoplasma tachyzoites
1	Anti-gastric actions of eugenol and cinnamic acid isolated from Cinnamomi Ramulus.We investigated the evidence of gastric protection for ulcer and gastritis by Cinnamomi Ramulus (Cinnamomum cassia Blume, Geiji, CR) extract and its several constituents. CR ethanolic extract showed the potent antioxidant activity and cytotoxicity of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and acid-neutralizing capacity. Especially, eugenol exerted a significant antioxidant activity and inhibited the colonization of H. pylori. In vivo test, eugenol and cinnamic acid significantly inhibited HCl/ethanol-induced gastric lesions and increased the mucus content though they didn't inhibit gastric secretion effectively. Taken together, eugenol and cinnamic acid, which were isolated from CR, exhibited the antioxidant activity in vitro and protective effect against gastric damage in vivo through stimulation of mucus secretion and so on. It suggested that they are useful as the neutraceuticals for gastritis.	cinnamomum cassia cinnamic acid
2	Characterization and evaluation of bioactive polyphenolic constituents from Zanthoxylum armatum DC., a traditionally used plant.Zanthoxylum armatum or Timoor has been used in different traditional system of medicine due to its aromatic properties and also in the treatment of cancer, diarrhea and cholera. In the present investigation, four chemically distinct compounds namely Tambulin (6), Prudomestin (7), Ombuin (8) and 3, 4, 5, 3', 4', 5'-hexahydroxydiphenyl ether (9) have been isolated and quantified from the fruits. To explore the biological activities, we have further studied the antiproliferative, antimicrobial and antioxidant efficacy. Tambulin which was also found in maximum amount (0.125%) in fruits revealed significant antiproliferative activity (IC50 37.96+-0.36 to 48.7+-0.21mug/mL) against breast, liver, colon and skin cancer cell lines corroborated by resilient binding interaction with SDH (-6.76Kcal/mol) and inhibition constant (Ki: 11.02muM). Hexane and ethyl acetate fraction exhibited moderate antibacterial efficacy (MIC: 250-1000mug/mL) against selected pathogenic microbes while Ombuin displayed broad spectrum antibacterial effect with MIC ranges from 125 to 500mug/mL. Total phenolic content (5.27+-0.06 to 46.12+-0.40mg/g of gallic acid equivalents), total flavonoids content (6.05+-0.24 to 14.46+-0.73mg/g of quercetin equivalents), ferric reducing power (42.35+-0.85 to 62.52+-0.66mg/g of ferrous sulfate equivalents) and percent free radical scavenging activity (59.56+-0.38 to 64.85+-1.78) were also estimated. Our findings infer that Tambulin exhibited significant antiproliferative activity whereas Ombuin was found to display broad spectrum antibacterial activity which adds one more positive attribute to its traditional usage.	zanthoxylum armatum colon
1	Effect of shodhana on the toxicity of abrus precatorius.Seeds of Gunja (Abrus precatorius Linn) are reported to be poisonous due to the presence of a toxic protein 'abrin and an alkaloid hypaphorine. Te seeds after subjecting to the process of shodhana, find use in a number of Ayurvedic preparations. HPLC studies revealed that the process of shodhana resulted in depletion of more toxic alkaloid hypaphorine and protein abrin.	abrus precatorius hypaphorine
1	Analysis of volatile components, fatty acids, and phytosterols of Abies koreana growing in Poland.Extracts and essential oils from seeds as well as essential oils from cone scales and needles with twigs of the Abies koreana population were studied. An analysis of Korean fir essential oils allowed us to determine 147 volatile compounds. The identified compounds constituted 97-99% of the seed, cone and needle oils. The main volatile in the seed and needle oils was limonene (56.6% and 23.4%, respectively), while the predominant volatile in cone oils was alpha-pinene (51.2%). Korean fir seeds provided a rich source of both essential oil (3.8-8.5%) and extract, which was isolated with a 24.5% yield and contained numerous groups of fatty acids and phytosterols (414 microg/100g extract). The most prominent fatty acids were unsaturated, among which linoleic (41.2%) and oleic (31.2%) fatty acid were the main ones while the dominant sterols were isomers of ergostadienol and beta-sitosterol. A. koreana seeds, cones and needles are a source of many volatile bioactive compounds while the seed extract, with a pleasant scent, contained not only volatiles, but also fractions rich in fatty acids and phytosterols. These facts make A. koreana essential oils and especially the seed extract potential components of cosmetics.	a. koreana fatty acids
2	Large-scale and effective screening of Korean medicinal plants for inhibitory activity on matrix metalloproteinase-9.Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) degrades type IV collagen constituting the major structural component of the basement membrane and extra cellular membrane. The enzymatic activity is found to be elevated in tumor tissues. With the aim of finding novel MMP-9 inhibitors from natural products, 87 extracts of oriental medicinal herbs, which are used as prescriptions for cancer treatment in traditional Korean medicine, were screened for their inhibitory activities towards MMP-9. It was found that most of the hexane and chloroform fractions as well as water extracts showed a weak inhibitory effect on MMP-9 activity at a concentration of 100mug/ml. However, a strong inhibition was found in the butanol fractions of Cinnamomum cassia PRESL, Magnolia obovata THUEB., Magnolia officinalis REHD. et WILS., Magnolia officinalis REHD. et WILS. var. biloba REHD. et WILS., and Euonymus alatus (THUNB.) SIEB. with inhibitory activity (&gt;90%) at a concentration of 100 microg/ml.	biloba cancer

2	[Effects of huangkui capsule on renal inflammatory injury by intervening p38MAPK signaling pathway in rats with adriamycin-induced nephropathy].OBJECTIVE: To explore the potential mechanisms of huangkui capsule (HKC), an extract from Abelmoschus manihot (AM), for ameliorating renal inflammatory injury by regulating p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway in rats with adriamycin-induced nephropathy (ADRN). METHOD: Nineteen Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into three groups, the sham-operation group, the untreated model group,and the HKC-treated group. Rats in the untreated model group and the HKC-treated group were made into ADRN model by right nephrectomy and twice intravenous injections of adriamycin( ADR, 0.4 mL and 0.2 mL respectively within 4 weeks). After the model successfully established, rats in the HKC-treated group were orally given HKC (2 mg x kg(-1) per day), while rats in the untreated model group and the sham-operation group were intervened with distilled water respectively. The intervention for all rats was 4 weeks. Rats' body weight were weighted and 24 h urinary protein excretion (Upro) was detected at the end of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th week after the intervention of HKC or distilled water. All rats were sacrificed at the end of the 8th week after nephrectomy, and then, to withdraw blood and kidney to examine the blood biochemical parameters, the glomerular morphological changes, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and collagen type I expressions,and the glomerular macrophages infiltration. Besides, the protein expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, p38MAPK, as well as phosphorylated p38MAPK (p-p38MAPK) in renal tissues were detected by Western blotting. RESULT: As compared with rats in the untreated model group, in the HKC-treated group,the HKC treatment significantly improved Upro, serum albumin, mesangial cell proliferation, extracellular matrix (ECM) and collagen deposition,and decreased the expression of alpha-SMA and collagen type I and the infiltration of ED1+ and ED3+ cells in glomeruli. In addition, it significantly down-regulated the protein expression of TGF-beta1 and p-p38MAPK in renal tissues. CONCLUSION: HKC had the effects on ameliorating renal inflammatory injury in vivo. It could reduce the expression of TGF-beta1 and improve the infiltration and activation of inflammatory cells in glomeruli by way of intervening p38MAPK signaling pathway in kidney through down-regulating the protein expression of p-p38MAPK, as the key signal molecule.

1	Antioxidant and cholinesterase inhibitory activity of a new peptide from Ziziphus jujuba fruits.Antioxidant agents and cholinesterase inhibitors are the foremost drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, a new peptide from Ziziphus jujuba fruits was investigated for its inhibitory activity against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) enzymes as well as antioxidant activity. This peptide was introduced as a new peptide and named Snakin-Z. The Snakin-Z displayed considerable cholinesterase inhibition against AChE and BChE. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of Snakin-Z against AChE and BChE are 0.58 +- 0.08 and 0.72 +- 0.085 mg/mL, respectively. This peptide has 80% enzyme inhibitory activity on AChE and BChE at 1.5 mg/mL. The Snakin-Z also had the high antioxidant activity (IC50 = 0.75 +- 0.09 mg/mL). Thus, it is suggested that Snakin-Z may be beneficial in the treatment of AD. However, more detailed researches are still required as in vivo testing its anticholinesterase and antioxidant activities.	ziziphus jujuba AD
2	Agrimonia pilosa Ledeb., Cinnamomum cassia Blume, and Lonicera japonica Thunb. protect against cognitive dysfunction and energy and glucose dysregulation by reducing neuroinflammation and hippocampal insulin resistance in beta-amyloid-infused rats.OBJECTIVES: The water extracts of Cinnamomum cassia Blume bark (CCB; Lauraceae), Lonicera japonica Thunb. flower (LJT; Caprifoliaceae), and Agrimonia pilosa Ledeb. leaves (APL; Rosaceae) prevented amyloid-beta (25-35)-induced cell death in PC12 cells in our preliminary study. We evaluated whether long-term oral consumption of CCB, LJT, and APL improves cognitive dysfunction and glucose homeostasis in rats with experimentally induced AD-type dementia. METHODS: Male rats received hippocampal CA1 infusions of amyloid-beta (25-35, AD) or amyloid-beta (35-25, non-plaque forming, normal-controls, Non-AD-CON), at a rate of 3.6 nmol/day for 14 days. AD rats were divided into four groups receiving either 2% lyophilized water extracts of CCB, LJT, or APL or 2% dextrin (AD-CON) in high-fat diets (43% energy as fat). RESULTS: Hippocampal amyloid-beta deposition, tau phosphorylation, and expressions of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (neruoinflammation markers) were increased, and insulin signaling decreased in AD-CON. CCB, LJT, and APL all prevented hippocampal amyloid-beta accumulation and enhanced hippocampal insulin signaling. CCB, LJT, and APL decreased TNF-alpha and iNOS in the hippocampus and especially APL exhibited the greatest decrease. AD-CON exhibited cognitive dysfunction in passive avoidance and water maze tests, whereas CCB, LJT, and APL protected against cognitive dysfunction, and APL was most effective and was similar to Non-AD-CON. AD-CON had less fat oxidation as an energy fuel, but it was reversed by CCB, LJT, and especially APL. APL-treated rats had less visceral fat than AD-CON rats. AD-CON rats exhibited impaired insulin sensitivity and increased insulin secretion during oral glucose tolerance test compared with Non-AD-CON, but CCB and APL prevented the impairment. DISCUSSION: These results supported that APL, LJT, and CCB effectively prevent the cognitive dysfunction and the impairment of energy and glucose homeostasis induced by amyloid-beta deposition by reducing neuroinflammation and enhancing insulin signaling. APL exhibited the greatest effectiveness for improving cognitive function.	cinnamomum cassia cognitive dysfunction
1	Antiproliferative Activity of Cinnamomum cassia Constituents and Effects of Pifithrin-Alpha on Their Apoptotic Signaling Pathways in Hep G2 Cells.Cinnamaldehyde (Cin), cinnamic acid (Ca) and cinnamyl alcohol (Cal), major constituents of Cinnamomum cassia, have been shown to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer and other activities. In this study, our aim was to evaluate the antiproliferative activity of these compounds in human hepatoma Hep G2 cells and examine the effects of pifithrin-alpha (PFTalpha; a specific p53 inhibitor) on their apoptotic signaling transduction mechanism. The antiproliferative activity was measured by XTT assay. Expression of apoptosis-related proteins was detected by western blotting. Results showed that at a concentration of 30 muM, the order of antiproliferative activity in Hep G2 cells was Cin &gt; Ca &gt; Cal. Cin (IC(50) 9.76 +- 0.67 muM) demonstrated an antiproliferative potency as good as 5-fluorouracil (an anti-cancer drug; IC(50) 9.57 +- 0.61 muM). Further studies on apoptotic mechanisms of Cin showed that it downregulated the expression of Bcl-(XL), upregulated CD95 (APO-1), p53 and Bax proteins, as well as cleaving the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in a time-dependent pattern. PFTalpha pre-incubation significantly diminished the effect of Cin-induced apoptosis. It markedly upregulated the anti-apoptotic (Bcl-(XL)) expression and downregulated the pro-apoptotic (Bax) expression, as well as effectively blocking the CD95 (APO-1) and p53 expression, and PARP cleavage in Cin-treated cells. This study indicates that Cin was the most potent antiproliferative constituent of C. cassia, and its apoptotic mechanism in Hep G2 cells could be mediated through the p53 induction and CD95 (APO-1) signaling pathways.	c. cassia Cal
2	Metabolic profiles of the Flos Abelmoschus manihot extract by intestinal bacteria from the normal and CKD model rats based on UPLC-Q-TOF/MS.Flos Abelmoschus manihot is a traditional herbal medicine widely used in clinical practice to tackle chronic kidney disease (CKD) for thousands of years. Nowadays, many studies indicate that gut bacteria are closely related to the progression of CKD and CKD-related complications. In this study, a UPLC-Q-TOF/MS method coupled with the MetaboLynx  software was established and successfully applied to investigate the metabolites and metabolic profile of Flos A. manihot extract by intestinal bacteria from normal and CKD rats. Eight parent components and eight metabolites were characterized by their protonated ions. Among these compounds, 15 were detected in the two group samples while M16 was only determined in the CKD model samples. Compared with the quercetin-type glycosides, fewer myricetin-type and gossypetin-type metabolites were obtained in the two group samples. These metabolites suggested that deglycosylation and methylation are the major metabolic pathways of Flos A. manihot extract. Few differences of metabolite classes were observed in the two group samples. However, the concentrations of aglycones such as quercetin, myricetin and gossypetin in the normal samples were notably higher than those in the CKD model samples. The results are important in unravelling the pharmacological effects of A. manihot and clarifying its mechanism of action in vivo.	a. manihot chronic kidney disease
1	Isolation, structures and bioactivities of the polysaccharides from jujube fruit (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.): A review.Jujube (Ziziphus Jujuba Mill.) has been eaten as a fruit and nutraceutical food in China for thousands of years. Recent phytochemical and pharmacological studies have shown that the polysaccharides are one of major biologically active components of the jujube fruit and have various biological effects, including immunomodulatory, antioxidant, antitumor, hepatoprotective, and hypoglycemic activities, and gastrointestinal-protective effects. Although the extraction and purification of jujube polysaccharides are tedious processes, including different steps of liquid- and solid-phase separation, the polysaccharides have been structurally characterized. However, the relationships between the structures and activities of the jujube polysaccharides are not well established. The purpose of the present review is to appraise the previous and current literature on the extraction, purification, structural characterization, and biological activities of jujube polysaccharides. This review should provide a useful bibliography for the further investigation, production, and application of jujube polysaccharides in functional foods and therapeutic agents.	jujube polysaccharides
1	Simultaneous qualitative and quantitative analysis of triterpenic acids, saponins and flavonoids in the leaves of two Ziziphus species by HPLC-PDA-MS/ELSD.The leaves of Ziziphus jujuba and Z. jujuba var. spinosa have been utilized as crude drugs for their health benefits in China for thousands of years. To control their quality, a reliable method based on high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with photo diode array and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry detection (HPLC-PDA-ESI-MS/MS) was developed for exploration of the chemical profiles of these jujube leaves. As the results, fourteen constituents including three flavonoids, two saponins and nine triterpenic acids were identified or tentatively characterized. Then, twelve of them such as quercetin-3-O-rutinoside, zizyphus saponins I and II, ceanothic acid, alphitolic acid, maslinic acid, 2alpha-hydroxyursolic acid, zizyberanalic acid, epiceanothic acid, ceanothenic acid, betulinic acid, and oleanolic acid were selected as the chemical markers and were determined using an HPLC coupled with evaporative light scattering detection (ELSD) method. The separation was carried out on a Waters Sunfire C18 column with 0.2 % acetic acid and acetonitrile as the mobile phase under gradient elution. The operating conditions of ELSD were set as 80 C for drift tube temperature and 2.7 l/min for nitrogen flow rate. The developed method was fully validated in terms of linearity, sensitivity, precision, repeatability as well as recovery, and subsequently applied to evaluate the quality of eight batches of Z. jujuba and Z. jujuba var. spinosa leaves from different collections.	z. jujuba var triterpenic acids
2	3-O-trans-p-coumaroyl-alphitolic acid, a triterpenoid from Zizyphus jujuba, leads to apoptotic cell death in human leukemia cells through reactive oxygen species production and activation of the unfolded protein response.3-O-trans-p-coumaroyl-alphitolic acid (3OTPCA), a triterpenoid isolated from the plant Zizyphus jujuba (ZJ), is known to be cytotoxic to cancer cells; however, the molecular mechanism underlying 3OTPCA-induced cell death remains unknown. Here, we provide novel evidence that 3OTPCA induces apoptotic cell death in human leukemia cells. We found that 3OPTCA induces DNA fragmentation within 24 h after treatment in U937 cells, which was also observed in other leukemia cell lines, including Molt-4 and Jurkat cells. We then investigated other parameters involved in apoptosis, including phosphatidylserine externalization and caspase-3 cleavage in U937 cells treated with 3OTPCA. 3OTPCA caused significant DNA fragmentation, annexin-V binding, and caspase-3 cleavage, indicating that 3OTPCA exerts cytotoxicity through apoptosis induction. RNA-seq analysis revealed that the expression of transcripts associated with the unfolded protein response (UPR), such as spliced XBP-1 and CHOP, were up-regulated by 3OTPCA treatment. 3OTPCA-induced UPR activation may be due to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress because both 3OTPCA and thapsigargin, an endoplasmic Ca2+ transport ATPase inhibitor, increased intracellular calcium levels. 3OTPCA down-regulated the expression of Bcl-2, a target of CHOP, and led to the loss of the mitochondrial membrane, indicating that the intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptotic pathway was triggered by 3OTPCA, likely through UPR activation. Furthermore, we found that 3OTPCA induced superoxide anion generation and, following p38 MAPK phosphorylation, caspase-8 cleavage without affecting Fas expression. It also induced subsequent Bid cleavage, which may enhance the apoptosis triggered by the intrinsic pathway. These findings reveal for the first time that 3OTPCA induces apoptotic cell death through the generation of reactive oxygen species and activation of UPR.	ziziphus spinosa insomnia
1	[Determination of triterpenoic acids in fruits of Ziziphus jujuba using HPLC-MS with polymeric ODS column].A simple and sensitive method has been developed to simultaneously determine betunilic acid, oleanolic acid and ursolic acid in the fruits of Ziziphus jujuba from different regions by HPLC-MS. This HPLC assay was performed on PAH polymeric C18 bonded stationary phase column with mobile phase contained acetonitrile-water (90: 10) and with negative ESI detection mode. The developed approach was characterized by short time consumption for chromatographic separation, high sensitivity and good reliability so as to meet the requirements for rapid analysis of large-batch fruits of Z. jujuba from different habitats.	z. jujuba ursolic acid
1	Chemical composition and antibacterial activities of the essential oil from Abies koreana.The essential oils from an alpine needle leaf of Abies koreana, which is a species native to Korea, was obtained by hydrodistillation with 0.9% (v/w) yield and analysed by GC and GC-MS. Sixty-eight constituents, accounting for more than 95.9% of the total oil composition, were identified. The main compounds with concentrations higher than 3% were borneol (27.9%), alpha-pinene (23.2%), beta-pinene (5.8%), terpinene-4-ol (3.8%), bornyl acetate (3.4%) and alpha-terpineol (3.1%). The antibacterial activity of the oil was evaluated against nine microorganisms using disc diffusion and broth microdilution methods. The essential oil exhibited some broad spectrum antibacterial activity against the tested organisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.	abies koreana terpinene-4-ol
1	Pharmacokinetics of daikenchuto, a traditional Japanese medicine (kampo) after single oral administration to healthy Japanese volunteers.The pharmacokinetics of daikenchuto (TJ-100), a pharmaceutical-grade traditional Japanese medicine, were investigated in healthy Japanese volunteers after a single oral administration of 2.5-, 5-, and 10-g doses. Six ingredients [hydroxy-alpha-sanshool (HAS), hydroxy-beta-sanshool (HBS), [6]-shogaol (6S), [10]-shogaol (10S), ginsenoside Rb1(GRB1), and ginsenoside Rg1(GRG1)] of TJ-100 were determined by using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The results indicated that HAS, an ingredient derived from Zanthoxylum piperitum fruit, exhibited the highest plasma concentration among the six ingredients investigated. The plasma concentrations of HAS, HBS, 6S, and 10S reached the maximum concentration (approximately 400, 80, 0.14, and 0.6 ng/ml, respectively, after a 5-g administration of TJ-100) within 30 min after administration, and the mean half-life was approximately 2 h. Thus, these compounds were rapidly absorbed and eliminated. The plasma concentration of GRB1 reached the maximum concentration (2 ng/ml after a 5-g administration of TJ-100) at approximately 4 h after administration and the half-life of GRB1 was approximately 40 h. The plasma concentration of GRG1 was extremely low (&lt;0.023 ng/ml). The pharmacokinetics of HAS, HBS, 6S, and 10S, were linear within the range of 2.5 to 10 g/day of TJ-100. On the other hand, the kinetics of GRB1 and GRG1 were not proportional to dosage, and plateauing was observed.	zanthoxylum piperitum hydroxy-alpha-sanshool
1	Xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity of constituents of Cinnamomum cassia twigs.A methanol extract of the twigs of Cinnamomum cassia was found to inhibit xanthine oxidase. Purification of the methanol extract afforded three new phenolic glycosides, cinnacasolide A-C (11-13), together with 10 known compounds (1-10). The structures of the three new compounds were determined by interpretation of spectroscopic data. Cinnamaldehyde derivatives 1-5 and 7 were significant inhibitors of xanthine oxidase, with IC(50) values ranging from 7.8 to 36.3 mug/mL. The results indicate that the acyl group of these cinnamaldehyde derivatives plays an important role in the inhibition of xanthine oxidase.	cinnamomum cassia glycosides
2	HPLC method for measurement of human salivary alpha-amylase inhibition by aqueous plant extracts.Control of hyperglycemia is an important treatment in metabolic disorders such as type II diabetes and obesity. alpha-Amylase, as the first enzyme of glucose release from dietary polysaccharides, is a potential target to identify new sources of novel anti-obesity and anti-diabetic drugs. In this work, different herbal extracts as alpha-amylase inhibitors were studied by measuring the rate of the cleavage of a maltooligomer substrate 2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl-beta-D-maltoheptoside. Measurement of chromophore containing products after reversed phase HPLC separation was used for alpha-amylase activity measurement. Rates of hydrolysis catalysed by human salivary alpha-amylase were determined in the presence and absence of lyophilised water extracts of eleven herbs. Remarkable bioactivities were found for extracts of Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume (bark), Camellia sinensis L. (leaf), Ribes nigrum L. (leaf), Laurus nobilis L. (leaf), Vaccinium macrocarpon Aiton (fruit) and Syzygium aromaticum L. (bud). Determined IC50 values were in 0.017-41 mug/ml range for these six selected plant extracts. Our results confirm the applicability of this HPLC-based method for the quick and reliable comparison of plants as alpha-amylase inhibitors.	vaccinium macrocarpon aiton type ii diabetes
2	Cinnamon extract induces tumor cell death through inhibition of NFkappaB and AP1.BACKGROUND: Cinnamomum cassia bark is the outer skin of an evergreen tall tree belonging to the family Lauraceae containing several active components such as essential oils (cinnamic aldehyde and cinnamyl aldehyde), tannin, mucus and carbohydrate. They have various biological functions including anti-oxidant, anti-microbial, anti-inflammation, anti-diabetic and anti-tumor activity. Previously, we have reported that anti-cancer effect of cinnamon extracts is associated with modulation of angiogenesis and effector function of CD8+ T cells. In this study, we further identified that anti-tumor effect of cinnamon extracts is also link with enhanced pro-apoptotic activity by inhibiting the activities NFkappaB and AP1 in mouse melanoma model. METHODS: Water soluble cinnamon extract was obtained and quality of cinnamon extract was evaluated by HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) analysis. In this study, we tested anti-tumor activity and elucidated action mechanism of cinnamon extract using various types of tumor cell lines including lymphoma, melanoma, cervix cancer and colorectal cancer in vitro and in vivo mouse melanoma model. RESULTS: Cinnamon extract strongly inhibited tumor cell proliferation in vitro and induced active cell death of tumor cells by up-regulating pro-apoptotic molecules while inhibiting NFkappaB and AP1 activity and their target genes such as Bcl-2, BcL-xL and survivin. Oral administration of cinnamon extract in melanoma transplantation model significantly inhibited tumor growth with the same mechanism of action observed in vitro. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that anti-tumor effect of cinnamon extracts is directly linked with enhanced pro-apoptotic activity and inhibition of NFkappaB and AP1 activities and their target genes in vitro and in vivo mouse melanoma model. Hence, further elucidation of active components of cinnamon extract could lead to development of potent anti-tumor agent or complementary and alternative medicine for the treatment of diverse cancers.	cinnamomum cassia cancers
1	Hypnotic effect of jujubosides from Semen Ziziphi Spinosae.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Semen Ziziphi Spinosae, the seed of Ziziphus jujuba Mill. var. spinosa (bunge) Hu ex H.F. Chow has been widely used in treating insomnia and anxiety. AIM OF THE STUDY: In this study, we investigated the hypnotic effect of jujubosides, one of the major components (saponin) of Semen Ziziphi Spinosae, in both day and night period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After the administration of jujubosides (9 mg/kg once per day for 3 days), sleep parameters were examined by EEG and EMG analysis in normal rats and the action of jujubosides on pentobarbital-induced sleep assessed by the loss-of righting reflex. RESULTS: During daytime (9:00-15:00), jujubosides significantly increased the total sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep without significant influence on non-REM (NREM) sleep. During nighttime (21:00-3:00), jujubosides significantly increased the total sleep and NREM sleep especially the light sleep while showed no significant effect on REM sleep and slow wave sleep (SWS). In pentobarbital-treated mice, jujubosides significantly augmented the hypnotic effect of pentobarbital (45 mg/kg, i.p.), proved by increasing sleep time and this augmentative effect was potentiated by 5-hydroxytryptophan (2mg/kg, i.p.). Furthermore, jujubosides inhibited the para-chlorophenylalanine-induced suppression of pentobarbital-induced hypnosis. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that the hypnotic effect of jujubosides on normal rats may be influenced by circadian rhythm and the serotonergic system may involve in the hypnotic effect of jujubosides. Jujubosides may be good source of lead compounds for novel hypnotics.	ziziphus jujuba mill. var jujubosides
3	Protective effects of cinnamic acid and cinnamic aldehyde on isoproterenol-induced acute myocardial ischemia in rats.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Cinnamomum cassia is a well-known traditional Chinese herb that is widely used for the treatment of ischemic heart disease (IHD). It has favorable effects, but its mechanism is not clear. To investigate the effects of cinnamic aldehyde (CA) and cinnamic acid (CD) isolated from Cinnamomum cassia against myocardial ischemia produced in rats by isoproterenol (ISO). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized equally to nine groups: a control group, an untreated model group, CA (22.5, 45, 90 mg/kg) or CD (37.5, 75, 150 mg/kg) treatment, or propranolol (30 mg/kg). Rats were treated for 14 days and then given ISO, 4 mg/kg for 2 consecutive days by subcutaneous injection. ST-segment elevation was measured after the last administration. Serum levels of creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), nitric oxide (NO), and blood rheology were measured after the rats were sacrificed. The hearts were excised for determining heart weight index, microscopic examination, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) measurements. RESULTS: CA and CD decreased the ST elevation induced by acute myocardial ischemia, decreased serum levels of CK-MB, LDH, TNF-alpha and IL-6, and increased serum NO activity. CA and CD increased SOD activity and decreased MDA content in myocardial tissue. CONCLUSION: CA and CD were cardioprotective in a rat model of ischemic myocardial injury. The protection was attributable to anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, as well as increased NO. The results support further study of CA and CD as potential treatments for ischemic heart disease.	cinnamic acid ischemic heart disease

1	Phytochemical and biological activities of four wild medicinal plants.The fruits of four wild plants, namely, Capparis decidua, Ficus carica, Syzygium cumini, and Ziziphus jujuba, are separately used as traditional dietary and remedial agents in remote areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. The results of our study on these four plants revealed that the examined fruits were a valuable source of nutraceuticals and exhibited good level of antimicrobial activity. The fruits of these four investigated plants are promising source of polyphenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, and saponins. These four plants' fruits are good sources of iron, zinc, copper, manganese, selenium, and chromium. It was also observed that these fruits are potential source of antioxidant agent and the possible reason could be that these samples had good amount of phytochemicals. Hence, the proper propagation, conservation, and chemical investigation are recommended so that these fruits should be incorporated for the eradication of food and health related problems. 	capparis decidua flavonoids
1	[Absorption of flavonoids from Abelmoschus manihot extract by in situ intestinal perfusion].To explore the mechanism of the absorption of flavonoids from Abelmoschus manihot flowers, in situ intestinal recirculation was performed to study the effect of the absorption at different concentrations and different intestinal regions. To evaluate the conditions of the absorption of six flavonoids from Abelmoschus manihot flowers, the concentrations of Abelmoschus manihot in the perfusion solution were determined by HPLC at predesigned time. And we have investigated the inhibitory effect of six flavonoids from Abelmoschus manihot flowers on P-glycoprotein (P-gp) drug efflux pump. The results demonstrated that the absorption rates of flavonoids from Abelmoschus manihot flowers are not significantly different (P &gt; 0.05) at various drug concentrations, the absorption of flavonoids from Abelmoschus manihot flowers is a first-order process with the passive diffusion mechanism. The absorption rates of each of flavonoids are significantly different. The absorption rate of flavonoid glycoside was lower than that of aglycone; the flavonoids from Abelmoschus manihot flowers could be absorbed in all of the intestinal segments. The best parts of intestine to absorb hyperoside and myricetin are jejunum and duodenum, separately. Verapamil could enhance the absorption of isoquercitrin, hyperoside, myricetin and quercetin-3'-O-glucoside by inhibiting P-glycoprotein (P-gp) drug efflux pump.	abelmoschus manihot quercetin-3'-O-glucoside
1	Nitidine chloride prevents OVX-induced bone loss via suppressing NFATc1-mediated osteoclast differentiation.Nitidine chloride (NC), a bioactive alkaloid isolated from Zanthoxylum nitidum, has been used as a herbal ingredient in toothpaste that prevents cavities for decades. It also displays potential antitumor and anti-inflammation properties. However, its anticatabolic effect on bone is not known. We investigated the effect of NC on osteoclastogenesis, bone resorption and RANKL-induced NF-kappaB and NFATc1 signalling. In mouse-derived bone marrow monocytes (BMMs), NC suppressed RANKL-induced multinucleated tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive osteoclast formation and bone resorption in a dose dependent manner. NC attenuated the expression of osteoclast marker genes including cathepsin K, D2, calcitonin receptor, NFATc1, and TRAP. Further, NC inhibited RANKL-activated NF-kappaB and NFATc1 signalling pathways. In vivo study revealed that NC abrogated oestrogen deficiency-induced bone loss in ovariectomized mice. Histological analysis showed that the number of osteoclasts was significantly lower in NC-treated groups. Collectively, our data demonstrate that NC suppressed osteoclastogenesis and prevented OVX-induced bone loss by inhibiting RANKL-induced NF-kappaB and NFATc1 signalling pathways. NC may be a natural and novel treatment for osteoclast-related bone lytic diseases.	zanthoxylum nitidum NC
1	Cytotoxic lignan esters from Cinnamomum osmophloeum.The bark and roots of Cinnamomum osmophloeum are widely used in Taiwan as spice substitutes for C. CASSIA. We have isolated three novel lignan esters, one dibenzylbutane-type ligan ester [9,9'-di-O-feruloyl-(+)-5,5'-dimethoxy secoisolariciresinol (3)] and two cyclolignan esters [(7' S,8' R,8 R) -lyoniresinol-9-O-(E)-feruloyl ester ( 5) and (7' S,8' R,8 R)-lyoniresinol-9,9'-di-O-(E)-feruloyl ester (6)], and several known lignans from the heartwood and roots of C. osmophloeum. We identified these compounds using 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Cytotoxicity assays of these novel lignan esters revealed that compound 6 has strong activities against human liver cancer (HepG2 and Hep3B) and oral cancer (Ca9-22) cells, with IC(50) values of 7.87, 4.31, and 2.51 microg/mL, respectively.	c. osmophloeum lignan esters
1	Antibacterial benzofuran neolignans and benzophenanthridine alkaloids from the roots of Zanthoxylum capense.Two new 2-arylbenzofuran neolignans and a new benzophenanthridine alkaloid, together with six known benzophenanthridine alkaloids, namely, decarine, norchelerythrine, dihydrochelerythrine, 6-acetonyldihydrochelerythrine, tridecanonchelerythrine, and 6-acetonyldihydronitidine, have been isolated from the MeOH extract of the roots of Zanthoxylum capense. Their structures were elucidated by means of spectroscopic techniques including 2D NMR experiments. All the isolated compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Some compounds showed significant inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 with MIC values ranging from 12.5 to 50 mug/mL.	zanthoxylum capense dihydrochelerythrine
2	Inhibitory effect of Abrus abrin-derived peptide fraction against Dalton's lymphoma ascites model.Peptides derived from larger molecules that are important modulators in cancer regression are becoming leads for development of therapeutic drugs. It has been reported that Abrus abrin, isolated from the seeds of Abrus precatorius, showed in vitro and in vivo antitumor properties by the induction of apoptosis. The present study was designed to evaluate the in vivo therapeutic effectiveness of abrin-derived peptide (ABP) fraction in Dalton's lymphoma (DL) mice model. The lethal dose (LD(50)) of ABP was found to be 2.25 mg/kg body weight and further the acute toxicity was determined with sublethal doses in normal mice. The acute toxicity like body weight, peripheral blood cell count, lympho-hematological and biochemical parameters remained unaffected till 200 microg/kg body weight of ABP. The sublethal doses of ABP showed very significant growth inhibitory properties in vivo DL mice model. There were 24%, 70.8% and 89.7% reductions in DL cell survival in 25, 50 and 100 microg/kg body weight of ABP, respectively. Analysis of the growth inhibitory mechanism in DL cells revealed nuclear fragmentation, and condensation with the appearance of the sub-G(0)/G(1) peak is indicative of apoptosis. Further, the Western blotting showed that apoptosis was mediated by the reduction in the ratio of Bcl-2 and Bax protein expression, and activation of caspase-3 through the release of cytochrome c in DL cells. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed an effective antitumor response (104.6 increase in life span (ILS) %) with a dose of 100 microg/kg body weight.	abrus precatorius dalton's lymphoma ascites
2	Zanthoxylum usambarense (Engl.) Kokwaro (Rutaceae) extracts inhibit the growth of the breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, but not the brain tumour cell line U251 in vitro.Zanthoxylum usambarense (Engl.) Kokwaro has traditionally been used for the treatment of malaria, upper respiratory tract infections, cough, rheumatism, tooth decay and sore gums in Kenya and other African countries. Dried ground parts of Z. usambarense were extracted by maceration using methanol (MeOH) at room temperature, extract was dried and reconstituted in 70% aq. MeOH and partitioned against n-hexane and chloroform (CHCl3 ) to obtain MeOH, n-hexane and CHCl3 extracts. All extracts were assessed for cytotoxicity against two breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, and the brain tumour cell line U251 by the MTT assay. The free-radical scavenging activity of the extracts was also determined by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryhydrazyl (DPPH) assay. In the DPPH assay, the MeOH extract was found to be the most active free-radical scavenger with a RC50 value of 41.1 x 10(-3)  mg/mL. It also displayed significant cytotoxicity against the MCF-7 cell line (IC50 42.9 microg/mL) and appeared to have induced cell death through apoptosis. None of the test extracts showed any activity against the U251 cell line at test concentrations. The present findings demonstrated that Z. usambarense could be a potential source for new cytotoxic compounds for possible anticancer drug development.	z. usambarense cough
3	Memory-enhancing effect of a supercritical carbon dioxide fluid extract of the needles of Abies koreana on scopolamine-induced amnesia in mice.Abies koreana Wilson (A. koreana) is a shrub or broadly pyramidal evergreen tree endemic in the mountainous regions of South Korea. We obtained the essential oil (EO) from alpine needle leaves of A. koreana by the supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) method. EO was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and 68 compounds were identified constituting 95.66% of the oil. The major components were elemol (11.17%), terpinen-4-ol (9.77%), sabinene (8.86%), 10(15)-cadien-4-ol (7.16%), alpha-terpineol (6.13%), alpha-pinene (6.07%) and gamma-terpinene (4.71%). To investigate the memory-enhancing effects, we conducted a passive avoidance test using a scopolamine (1 mg/kg, ip)-induced amnesia mouse model. A peritoneal injection of EO from A. koreana (100 mg/kg) showed a memory enhancing effect of 72.7% compared with the control. These results suggest that EO of A. koreana may be a useful therapeutic agent against such amnesia-inducing diseases as Alzheimer and vascular dementia.	essential oil amnesia
4	Mechanisms of Action of Cassiae Semen for Weight Management: A Computational Molecular Docking Study of Serotonin Receptor 5-HT2C.Overweight and obesity is a growing global health concern. Current management of obesity includes lifestyle intervention, bariatric surgery and medication. The serotonin receptor, 5-HT2C, is known to mediate satiety, appetite and consumption behaviour. Lorcaserin, an appetite control drug, has demonstrated efficacy in appetite control by targeting 5-HT2C but causes undesirable side effects. This study aimed to explore the potential usage of Cassiae semen (CS), a well-known traditional Chinese medicine used to treat obesity. A computational molecular docking study was performed to determine the binding mechanism of CS compounds to the 5-HT2C receptors in both active, agonist-bound and inactive, antagonist-bound conformations. By comparing binding poses and predicted relative binding affinities towards the active or inactive forms of the receptor, we hypothesise that two of the CS compounds studied may be potent agonists which may mimic the appetite suppression effects of lorcaserin: obtusifoliol and cassiaside B2. Furthermore, two ligands, beta-sitosterol and juglanin, were predicted to bind favourably to 5-HT2C outside of the known agonist binding pocket in the active receptor, suggesting that such ligands may serve as positive allosteric modulators of 5-HT2C receptor function. Overall, this study proposed several CS compounds which may be responsible for exerting anti-obesity effects via appetite suppression by 5-HT2C receptor activation.	5-HT2C obesity
3	The Effects of Different Purifying Methods on the Chemical Properties, in Vitro Anti-Tumor and Immunomodulatory Activities of Abrus cantoniensis Polysaccharide Fractions.Abrus cantoniensis (Hance) is a popular Chinese vegetable consumed as a beverage, soup or folk medicine. To fully exploit the potential of the polysaccharide in Abrus cantoniensis, nine polysaccharide fractions of Abrus cantoniensis were isolated and purified (AP-AOH30-1, AP-AOH30-2, AP-AOH80-1, AP-AOH80-2, AP-ACl-1, AP-ACl-2, AP-ACl-3, AP-H and AP-L). Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and gas chromatography (GC) were used to characterize these Abrus polysaccharides fractions (APF). In vitro anti-tumor and immunomodulatory activities were also investigated and compared using the rank-sum ratio (RSR) method. Results demonstrated significant differences in the structure and bioactivities among APF, which were associated to the process used for their purification. Among the APF, AP-ACl-3 yield was 613.5 mg/kg of product and consisted of rhamnose (9.8%), arabinose (8.9%), fructose (3.0%), galactose (9.9%), glucose (4.3%), galacturonic acid (3.0%) and glucuronic acid (61.1%) with a molecular weight of 4.4 x 104 Da. Furthermore, AP-ACl-3 exhibited considerable bioactivities significantly preventing the migration of MCF-7 cells and stimulating lymphocyte proliferation along with nitric oxide (NO) production of peritoneal macrophages. AP-ACl-3 could be explored as a novel potential anti-tumor and immunomodulatory agent. 	polysaccharides tumor
4	Sichuan pepper extracts block the PAK1/cyclin D1 pathway and the growth of NF1-deficient cancer xenograft in mice.There is increasing evidence that more than 70% of cancers including pancreatic, breast and prostate cancers as well as neurofibromatosis (NF) are highly addicted to abnormal activation of the Ser/Thr kinase PAK1 for their growth. So far FK228 is the most potent among the HDAC (histone deacetylase) inhibitors that block the activation of both PAK1 and another kinase AKT, downstream of PI-3 kinase. However, FK228 is still in clinical trials (phase 2) for a variety of cancers (but not for NF as yet), and not available for most cancer/NF patients. Thus, we have been exploring an alternative which is already in the market, and therefore immediately useful for the treatment of those desperate cancer/NF patients. Here we provide the first evidence that extracts of Chinese/ Japanese peppercorns (Zanthoxyli Fructus) from the plant Zanthoxylum piperitum called "Hua Jiao"/"Sansho", block selectively the key kinase PAK1, leading to the downregulation of cyclin D1. Unlike FK228, these extracts do not inhibit AKT activation at the concentrations that block either cancer growth or PAK1 activation. The Chinese pepper extract selectively inhibits the growth of NF1-deficient malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) cells, without affecting the growth of normal fibroblasts, and suppresses the growth of NF1-deficient human breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) xenograft in mice. Our data suggest that these peppercorn extracts would be potentially useful for the treatment of PAK1-dependent NF such as MPNST, in addition to a variety of PAK1-dependent cancers including breast cancers.

2	Antiproliferative and anticarcinogenic effects of an aqueous preparation of Abies alba and Viscum album se abies, on a L-1210 malignant cell line and tumor-bearing Wistar rats.Extracts of plants have been widely tested for possible anticarcinogenic properties. In the present study a traditional remedy, consisting of an aqueous extract of mixed parts of the tree Abies alba and its mistletoe Viscum album se abies was tested on benzo(alpha)pyrene(BaP)-induced tumors in Wistar rats and on the L-1210 malignant cell line. Two main groups of male Wistar rats subcutaneously injected by 10 mg of BaP, a dose inducing 100% carcinogenesis, a control group (C-G, 15 rats) and a treatment group(TR-G, 18 rats), were used for the study. Five animals bearing BaP-induced tumors were also tested (TR-1-G). Animals of the TR-G were orally administered with the aqueous extract at doses of 50 ml/kg b.w, from the day of BaP injection and of the TR-1-G, from the 120th day of injection, till death. L-1210 malignant cells in cultivation, were administered with a powder obtained by condensation and lyophilization of the extract, at various concentrations and cytotoxicity was measured by the microculture tetrazolium assay. Autopsy of the rats, revealed metastasis in the lungs of the animals of all groups and the tumors developed were histologically identified as leiomyosarcomas. The results indicated that the extract of the above plants possess anticarcinogenic effects, documented by: a) its antiproliferative effects on L-1210 cells (IC50 = 49.6 +/- 1.4 micrograms/ml), b) the significant prolongation of life and reduction of tumor growth rate of the animals of the TR-G in comparison to the C-G, c) the inhibition by 16.6% of tumor induction in the TR-G and d) the prolongation of life and the necrotic effects of the extract on the tumors of the animals in the TR-1-G. The antiproliferative effects of the Abies alba and Viscum album se abies extract may be due to the lectins and thionins contained in Viscum album, as well as to the monoterpenes contained in Abies alba. Soft tissue tumors sensitive to the extract, are widespread among human organs, even in larynx, and are usually resistant to chemotherapy.	viscum album tumors
1	Cinnamaldehyde induces apoptosis and reverses epithelial-mesenchymal transition through inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in non-small cell lung cancer.Cinnamaldehyde, the main chemical component of the essential oil separated from the traditional herb Cinnamomum cassia, has been demonstrated to be an efficient cytotoxic agent against several human cancers. The present experiment showed that cinnamaldehyde dose-dependently depresses the proliferation of three types of NSCLC cells and induces cell apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, cinnamaldehyde attenuated CoCl2-induced EMT and decreased matrix metalloprotease (MMP) family while the in vivo study showed the same trend. Mechanistically, cinnamaldehyde imitated the suppressive effect of XAV939 on cell motility and EMT which could be impaired by LiCl. Collectively, our research demonstrated for the first time that cinnamaldehyde is able to inhibit NSCLC cell growth by inducing apoptosis and reverse EMT through terminating Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, which might supply further insight into cinnamaldehyde-mediated anti-tumor effect against NSCLC for better prognosis.	cinnamomum cassia cinnamaldehyde
2	Anticonvulsant, antidepressant-like activity of Abelmoschus manihot ethanol extract and its potential active components in vivo.Depression is the most common psychiatric comorbidity in patients with epilepsy. Searching for antiepileptic (anticonvulsant) and antidepressant-like medicines from natural products is very important for the treatment of this disease. The flower of Abelmoschus manihot (Linn.) Medicus has been reported to have neuroprotective effect against cerebral ischemia injury. In order to further explore the activity of Abelmoschus manihot on the central nervous system, the anticonvulsant and antidepressant-like effects of Abelmoschus manihot ethanol extract (AMEE) as well as its potential active components in vivo was investigated in the present study. It was found that AMEE could protect mice against PTZ-induced clonic convulsions and mortality. AMEE could also decrease immobility time in the FST in mice. Furthermore, the potential active components of AMEE in rat brain were identified by ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometer (UPLC-MS). Five parent components including isoquercitrin, hyperoside, hibifolin, quercetin-3'-O-glucoside, quercetin and three metabolites were detected in rat brain after administration of AMEE. In conclusion, eight flavonoids were identified in rat brain after administration of AMEE; meanwhile, these flavonoids might represent the potential bioactive components of AMEE and contribute to its anticonvulsant and antidepressant-like activity in vivo.	abelmoschus manihot cerebral ischemia injury
2	Effects of butanol fraction of Ziziphus mucronata root ethanol extract on glucose homeostasis, serum insulin and other diabetes-related parameters in a murine model for type 2 diabetes.CONTEXT: Ziziphus mucronata Willd (Rhamnaceae) is currently used in Nigerian traditional treatment of diabetes mellitus. However, detailed information on the antidiabetic potential of the plant parts is presently unknown. OBJECTIVES: The present study investigated the antidiabetic effects of the butanol fraction of Z. mucronata root (ZMBF) in a type 2 diabetes (T2D) model of rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: T2D was induced in rats by feeding a 10% fructose solution ad libitum for two weeks followed by an intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (40 mg/kg bw) and the animals were orally treated with ZMBF 150 or 300 mg/kg bw for five days a week for four weeks. Food and fluid intake, body weight changes and blood glucose levels were monitored during the experiment while other blood and organ specific diabetes-associated parameters were measured at the end of the experiment. RESULTS: After four-week treatment, significantly (p &lt; 0.05) lower blood glucose (19.24 vs 28.96 mmol/L), improved glucose tolerance ability (21.26 vs 28.56 mmol/L), higher serum insulin (131.37 vs 64.20 pmol/L) and liver glycogen (2.40 vs 1.54 mg/g tissue) were observed in the 300 mg/kg ZMBF ingested group compared with the diabetic control group. However, food and fluid intake, body weight gain, HOMA-beta, HOMA-IR, serum fructosamine level, hepatic and renal function tests were not significantly (p &gt; 0.05) affected by the treatment of ZMBF. CONCLUSION: Results of this study suggest that ZMBF treatment, at 300 mg/kg bw, possess antidiabetic activity, but could not ameliorate some diabetes-related parameters in type 2 diabetic rats.	z. mucronata diabetic
1	Antioxidant and antilisterial effect of seed essential oil and organic extracts from Zizyphus jujuba.Hydrodistilled volatile oil from the seeds of Zizyphus jujuba was analyzed by GC-MS. Twenty three compounds representing 91.59% of the total oil was identified. The oil and organic extracts revealed a great potential of antilisterial effect against all five strains of Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19111, 19116, 19118, 19166 and 15313. Also the oil had strong detrimental effect on the viable count of the tested bacteria. The samples were also subjected to screening for the antioxidant activity by using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and superoxide radicals scavenging activities assay. In the first case, the IC(50) value of the Z. jujuba essential oil was determined to be 5.21+/-0.01 microg/ml. Among the extracts, the strongest activity was exhibited by the methanol extract with an IC(50) value of 20.44+/-0.18 microg/ml. In the superoxide radicals scavenging activities assay, methanol extract was superior to all other extracts (IC(50)=18.60+/-0.3 microg/ml). Furthermore, the amount of total phenolic compounds was determined. The results indicate that the essential oil and extracts of Z. jujuba could serve as natural antimicrobial and antioxidant agents for the food industry.	z. jujuba essential oil
1	Purification and characterization of a thermal hysteresis protein from a plant, the bittersweet nightshade Solanum dulcamara.Thermal hysteresis proteins (THPs), which depress the freezing point of water below the melting point (producing a characteristic thermal hysteresis), are well known for their antifreeze activity in both fish and terrestrial arthropods, but have only recently been identified in plants. This study describes the purification of a THP from winter-collected bittersweet nightshade, Solanum dulcamara, using ion exchange and preparative 'free flow' isoelectric focusing. The THP has a molecular mass of 67 kDa (considerably larger than those of animal THPs), and an unusually high glycine component (23.7 mol%). Treatments of the THP with periodate or borate caused inactivation, suggesting the presence of carbohydrate. More specific treatments directed at galactose (beta-galactosidase or Abrus precatorius lectin) also resulted in inactivation, indicating that galactose is present. A thermal hysteresis activity versus THP concentration curve showed that the specific activity of the S. dulcamara THP is lower than that of any known animal THP. The functional significance of this low activity is discussed.	abrus precatorius galactose
1	The inhibitory effects of jujuboside A on rat hippocampus in vivo and in vitro.Jujuboside A (JuA) is a glycoside extracted from the seed of Ziziphus jujuba Mill var. spinosa (Bunge) Hu ex H F Chou, a Chinese herbal medicine, which has long been known as a sedative-hypnotic drug. The present study used the method of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) JuA in vivo to detect the effect of JuA on paired-pulse responses of dentate gyrus granule cells in urethane-anaesthetized rats, and the method of hippocampal slice bathing in JuA in vitro to detect the effects of JuA on the responses of CA1 pyramidal cells. The results showed that JuA significantly decreased the slopes of excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) and the amplitudes of population spike (PS) in the first responses of granule cells and significantly decreased EPSP and PS in the responses of CA1 pyramidal cells. The good quantitative correspondence between in vitro and in vivo results indicates that studies using hippocampal formation allow research on the inhibitory effects of JuA in the rat central nervous system (CNS). In conclusion, our study accessed the inhibitory effects of JuA on hippocampal formation in vivo and in vitro, which contributed to the further research on the mechanism of its effects on CNS.	ziziphus jujuba mill var jujuboside a
1	Three new cyclopeptide alkaloids from Zizyphus species.Two new cyclopeptide alkaloids, xylopyrine-D and xylopyrine-E, from Zizyphus xylopyra and a new alkaloid, jubanine-E, from Zizyphus jujuba have been isolated and their structures were established by chemical and spectral evidences.

2	Evaluation of antidiabetic potential of selected traditional Chinese medicines in STZ-induced diabetic mice.AIMS: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used for treating complex chronic diseases owing to their fewer side-effects, better patient tolerance and relatively less cost. The present work was carried out to study the anti-diabetic efficacy and mechanisms of 34 TCMs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic mice were orally administrated with corresponding herbal solution once a day for 4 weeks. At the end of experiment, the level of plasma glucose, malondialdehyde (MDA), the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the serum aldose reductase (AR) were determined, the effects of TCM extract on alpha-glucosidase and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in vitro were also evaluated. RESULTS: 13 out of the 34 herbs showed a statistically significant plasma glucose lowering action compared with the diabetic control group. Biochemical analysis revealed that Atractylodes macrocephala, Codonopsis pilosula, Dioscorea opposite, Flos lonicerae and Pueraria lobata may retard the progression of diabetes via reduce the blood glucose level and prevent the increase of AR activity. Other tested herbs, such as Ramulus cinnamomi, Cinnamomum cassia, and Eucommia ulmoides, showed the antidiabetic ability by either prevent the decrease in SOD activity or suppress the increase of MDA. Zymologic assay reveals that Pueraria lobata and Anemarrhena asphodeloides showed the highest inhibition against alpha-glucosidase and ACE respectively. Interestingly, the post-treatment glucose levels and AR activity were positively correlated with kidney/body weight of 34 herbs treated diabetic mice (p = 0.02, 0.04 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Several potential antidiabetic herbs derived from Chinese traditional pharmacopeia such as Dioscorea opposite, Pueraria lobata, Codonopsis pilosula and Ramulus cinnamomi, have been found to exert a beneficial action on diabetes and diabetic complications via multi-mechanisms.	codonopsis pilosula diabetic
1	Mast cell stabilizing and antiallergic activity of Abrus precatorius in the management of asthma.OBJECTIVE: To investigate effects of ethanol extract of Abrus precatorius leaves (EAPL) on egg albumin induced mast cell degranulation in mice and passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in rats. METHODS: In present study ethanol extract of Abrus precatorius leaves (EAPL) at doses of 100, 125, 150 mg/kg i.p were evaluated for preliminary phytochemical screening, acute toxicity studies and egg albumin induced mast cell degranulation in mice and passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in rats. RESULTS: The results of present investigation showed that the LD(50) of EAPL is more than 1 300 mg/kg. EAPL (100-150 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly protect egg albumin induced degranulation of mast cell and inhibit area of leakage of dye in passive cutaneous anaphylaxis. Phytochemical studies observed presence of saponin, alkaloids, flavonoids, and glycosides. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion EAPL possesses anti asthmatic potential.	abrus precatorius flavonoids
1	Bioefficacy of essential and vegetable oils of Zanthoxylum xanthoxyloides seeds against Acanthoscelides obtectus (Say) (Coleoptera: Bruchidae).Experiments were conducted in the laboratory to evaluate the bioefficacy of essential and vegetable oils of Zanthoxylum xanthoxyloides (Rutaceae) against Acanthoscelides obtectus (Coleoptera: Bruchidae). The chemical composition of the essential oil and the fatty acid composition of the vegetable oil extracted from the seeds of Z. xanthoxyloides were determined. The insecticidal activities of these oils and the associated aromatized clay powder were evaluated against A. obtectus. Both oils were strongly repellent (100% repellency at 0.501 mul/cm2 essential oil and 3.144 mul/cm2 vegetable oil) and highly toxic (LC50 = 0.118 mul/cm2 for essential oil) to this beetle after contact on filter paper. The vapors of the essential oil were highly toxic to adult insects (LC50 = 0.044 mul/cm3), and the aromatized powder made from clay and essential oil was more toxic (LD50 = 0.137 mul/g) than the essential oil alone (LD50 = 0.193 mul/g) after 2 days of exposure on a common bean. Both oils greatly reduced the F1 insect production and bean weight loss and did not adversely affect the bean seed viability. In general, the results obtained indicate that these plant oils can be used for control of A. obtectus in stored beans.	a. obtectus essential oil

1	Effect of molluscicidal components of Abrus precatorius, Argemone mexicana and Nerium indicum on certain biochemical parameters of Lymnaea acuminata.Exposure to 40% and 80% of the 24 h LC50 of the molluscicidal component of Abrus precatorius (abrin and glycyrrhizin), Argemone mexicana (protopine and sanguinarine) and Nerium indicum (oleandrin) caused a significant decrease in the levels of protein, free amino acid, DNA and RNA in the nervous tissue of Lymnaea acuminata. Except for glycyrrhizin, all the above molluscicides caused a significant reduction in phospholipid levels and a simultaneous increase in the rate of lipid peroxidation in the nervous tissue of treated snails.	argemone mexicana sanguinarine
4	2-Methoxycinnamaldehyde inhibits the TNF-alpha-induced proliferation and migration of human aortic smooth muscle cells.The abnormal proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is a crucial event in the development of atherosclerosis, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is actively involved in this process by enhancing the proliferation and migration of VSMCs. 2-Methoxycinnamaldehyde (MCA) is a natural compound of Cinnamomum cassia. Although 2-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (HCA), another compound from Cinnamomum cassia, has been widely studied with regard to its antitumor activity, MCA has not attracted researchers' interest due to its mild toxic effects on cancer cells and its mechanisms of action remain unknown. In this study, we examined the effects of MCA on the TNF-alpha-induced proliferation and migration of human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). As shown by our results, MCA inhibited TNF-alpha-induced cell proliferation by reducing the levels of cyclin D1, cyclin D3, CDK4 and CDK6, and increasing the levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p21 and p27, without resulting in cellular cytotoxicity. Furthermore, MCA decreased the level of secreted matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 by inhibiting MMP-9 transcription. Unexpectedly, MCA did not affect the TNF-alpha-induced levels of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). However, by showing that MCA potently inhibited the degradation of IkappaBalpha and the subsequent nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), we demonstrated that MCA exerts its effects through the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. MCA also effectively inhibited platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced HASMC migration. Taken together, these observations suggest that MCA has the potential for use as an anti-atherosclerotic agent.	IkappaBalpha atherosclerotic
2	Medicinal Plants Targeting Cardiovascular Diseases in View of Avicenna.BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a spectrum of diseases involving the heart and blood vessels, and the first cause of mortality worldwide. Medicinal plants have been used for thousands of years to treat CVD. In Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM), there is a special focus on heart diseases. Avicenna, a Persian physician of the eleventh century compiled a book devoted to this field named "The treatise on cardiac drugs" which is a compendium of TPM knowledge on CVD. Avicenna mentioned 50 cardiovascular active plants and described their therapeutic effects in the treatment of CVDs. METHODS: Here, we perform a detailed search in scientific databases to verify the cardiovascular activities of the medicinal plants suggested by Avicenna. Also, we discussed cardiovascular activities of a number of the most important suggested plants as well as their efficacy in clinical studies. Major bioactive compounds identified from these plants are also discussed. RESULTS: Pharmacological studies have revealed that the majority of these plants are effective in cardiovascular health with various mechanisms. Among them, Crocus sativus L., Cinnamomum cassia (L.) J. Presl, Punica granatum L., Ocimum basilicum L., Elettaria cardamomum (L.) Maton, Melissa officinalis L. and Phyllanthus emblica L. have proved to be more effective. CONCLUSION: The above-mentioned plants can be rich sources for developing new and effective pharmaceuticals for the treatment of CVDs.	cinnamomum cassia cardiovascular disease
1	Topical antiinflammatory activity of the major lipophilic constituents of the rhizome of Zingiber cassumunar. Part I: The essential oil.The essential oil of the rhizome of Zingiber cassumunar was found to exhibit a topical antiinflammatory effect, when tested using the model of carrageenan-induced hind paw edema in rats (ID(50) = 22 mg oil/paw). Individual assessment of topical antiinflammatory activity of the five major components of the oil demonstrated that (E)-1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)butadiene (DMPBD), terpinen-4-ol and alpha-terpinene significantly inhibited edema formation, whereas sabinene and gamma-terpinene were inactive up to 6 mg/paw. The most active compound, DMPBD, was found to be an antiinflammatory agent twice as potent as the reference drug diclofenac (ID(50) = 3 vs 6 mg/paw, respectively).	zingiber cassumunar DMPBD
1	Combined analysis by GC (RI), GC-MS and 13C NMR of the supercritical fluid extract of Abies alba twigs.Two samples (leaves and twigs) of Abies alba Miller from Corsica were extracted using supercritical CO2 and their chemical compositions were compared with those of the essential oils obtained from the same batch of plant material. In total 45 components were identified using combined analysis by GC (RI), GC-MS and 13C NMR. It was observed that the contents of monoterpenes (mainly represented by limonene, alpha-pinene and camphene) were significantly lower in the supercritical fluid extract (SFE) than in the essential oil (EO). Conversely, the proportions of sesquiterpenes were much higher in CO2 extracts than in essential oils (around 30% vs 4%). Cis-abienol, a diterpene alcohol, was identified only in SFE, and the proportions of this constituent (7.5% and 17.3%) were determined using quantitative 13C NMR since it was under estimated using the standard conditions of GC.	abies alba essential oils
2	Hypoglycemic Activity of Aqueous Root Bark Extract Zanthoxylum chalybeum in Alloxan-Induced Diabetic Rats.BACKGROUND: Medicinal plants offer cheaper and safer treatment options to current diabetic drugs. The present study evaluated the effect of aqueous root bark extract of Zanthoxylum chalybeum on oral glucose tolerance and pancreas histopathology in alloxanized rats. METHOD: Diabetes was induced in rats by administration of alloxan monohydrate. Root extract of Z. chalybeum was administered to rats at 200 and 400 mg/kg BW daily for 28 days. Blood glucose was measured by glucometer and pancreatic histopathology evaluated microscopically. RESULTS: Initial increase was observed in blood glucose of the rats after oral administration of glucose from time zero. Two hours after treatment with Z. chalybeum, a significant reduction in blood glucose was observed within treatment groups (p &lt; 0.05) compared to 0.5 hr and 1 hr. There was no significant difference between treatment group receiving 400mg/Kg BW extract and the normal groups (p = 0.27), implying that the former group recovered and were able to regulate their blood sugar, possibly via uptake of glucose into cells. The reversal in pancreatic histopathology further supports the protective effect of Z. chalybeum extract towards diabetic damage. CONCLUSION: Extract of Z. chalybeum is effective in controlling blood glucose in diabetes and protecting pancreatic tissues from diabetic damage.	z. chalybeum blood glucose in diabetes
4	Development and characterization of immobilized cannabinoid receptor (CB1/CB2) open tubular column for on-line screening.Cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, are therapeutic targets in the treatment of anxiety, obesity, movement disorders, glaucoma, and pain. We have developed an on-line screening method for CB1 and CB2 ligands, where cellular membrane fragments of a chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line, KU-812, were immobilized onto the surface of an open tubular (OT) capillary to create a CB1/CB2-OT column. The binding activities of the immobilized CB1/CB2 receptors were established using frontal affinity chromatographic techniques. This is the first report that confirms the presence of functional CB1 and CB2 receptors on KU-812 cells. The data from this study confirm that the CB1/CB2-OT column can be used to determine the binding affinities (K(i) values) for a single compound and to screen individual compounds or a mixture of multiple compounds. The CB1/CB2-OT column was also used to screen a botanical matrix, Zanthoxylum clava-herculis, where preliminary results suggest the presence of a high-affinity phytocannabinoid.	CB2 obesity

1	In vitro activities of plant extracts on human Loa loa isolates and cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells.Loa loa, a filarial worm, can cause fatal encephalitis in humans. In an attempt to find alternatives to the standard treatments (ivermectin and diethylcarbamazine citrate), we tested 12 methanolic extracts of nine traditional plant remedies. The extracts (100-0.09 microg/ml) were incubated with 20 Loa loa microfilariae isolated from patients at 37 degrees C with 5% CO(2) in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal serum and antibiotics. Activity was evaluated 120 h later by counting live microfilariae under a microscope. Cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells was estimated by measuring 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2-5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide transformation to formazan at 450 nM in a spectrophotometer. The plants tested were Lophira alata, Greenwayodendron suaveolens, Uapaca togoensis, Zanthoxylum heitzii, Peperomia pellucida, Piptadeniastrum africanum, Petersianthus macrocarpus, Vernonia conferta, and Vernonia hymenolepis. Chemical screening showed that most of the extracts contained reducing sugars, tannin or polyphenols, sterols or triterpenes, saponosides, and alkaloids. None contained carotinoids and few contained flavonoids. The 50% lethal concentration ranged from 0.22 to 70.28 microg/ml, while the 50% inhibitory concentration for eukaryotic cells (IC(50)) ranged from 8.52 to 119.52 microg/ml. Extracts of P. macrocarpus (selectivity index = 72.16), P. africanum (13.69), Z. heitzii (12.11), and L. alata (9.26) were highly selective for L. loa.	p. macrocarpus alkaloids
4	Antiproliferative activity of trans-avicennol from Zanthoxylum chiloperone var. angustifolium against human cancer stem cells.Zanthoxylum chiloperone var. angustifolium root bark was studied with the aim of finding novel molecules able to overcome cancer stem cell chemoresistance. Purification of a methanol-soluble extract resulted in the isolation of a known pyranocoumarin, trans-avicennol (1). Compound 1 demonstrated antiproliferative activity on glioma-initiating cells, whereas it was inactive on human neural stem cells. trans-Avicennol (1) activated the MAPK/ERK pathway and was also evaluated for its ability to inhibit the enzyme indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase.

1	Influence of Binasal and Uninasal Inhalations of Essential Oil of Abies koreana Twigs on Electroencephalographic Activity of Human.Objectives. The present work investigates the effect of essential oil from the twigs of Abies koreana on electroencephalographic (EEG) activity of human brain in order to understand the influence of binasal and uninasal inhalations. Methods. To accomplish this study, the essential oil from the twigs of A. koreana (AEO) was isolated by steam distillation and the EEG readings were recorded using QEEG-8 system from 8 grounding electrodes according to the International 10-20 System. Results. D-Limonene (25.29%), bornyl acetate (19.31%), camphene (12.48%), alpha-pinene (11.88%), beta-pinene (6.45%), and eudesm-7(11)-en-ol (5.38%) were the major components in the essential oil. In the EEG study, the absolute alpha (left frontal and right parietal) and absolute fast alpha (right parietal) values significantly increased during the binasal inhalation of AEO. In the uninasal inhalation, absolute beta and theta values decreased significantly, especially in the right frontal and left and right parietal regions. The results revealed that the AEO produced different EEG power spectrum changes according to the nostril difference. Conclusion. The changes in EEG values due to the inhalation of AEO may contribute to the enhancement of relaxation (binasal inhalation) and alertness/attention (right uninasal inhalation) states of brain which could be used in aromatherapy treatments.	a. koreana D-Limonene
1	[Studies on the chemical constituents from the peel of Zanthoxylum schinifolium Sieb et Zucc].Five compounds have been isolated from the Chinese traditional drug Qinghuajiao (Zanthoxylum schinifolium Sieb et Zucc). On the basis of UV, IR, 1HNMR, 13CNMR, 1H-1H COSY, 1H-13C COSY, NOESY and MS spectroscopic analysis, four of them have been identified as bergarpten (I), umbelliferone (II), skimmianine (III) and schinifoline (IV) respectively. The compounds II, III and IV were obtained for the first time from Zanthoxylum schinifolium, and the last one is a new compound.	zanthoxylum schinifolium schinifoline
1	Evaluation of thermal-oxidative stability and antiglioma activity of Zanthoxylum tingoassuiba essential oil entrapped into multi- and unilamellar liposomes.Zanthoxylum tinguassuiba essential oil (ZtEO) contains alpha-bisabolol, a known antiglioma sesquiterpene, among other potentially active substances. Medical applications of this essential oil require advances in the design of distinctive carriers due to its low water solubility and easy degradation by heat, light, and oxygen. The aim of this work was to evaluate enhancement in oxidative stability and the ability to reduce glioblastoma cell viability of ZtEO loaded into liposomes. Multi- and unilamellar vesicles were prepared to carry ZtEO. By using thermal analysis, it was observed that thermal-oxidative stability of the liposomal ZtEO was enhanced, when compared to its free form. Liposomal ZtEO also presented significant apoptotic-inducing activity for glioma cells. These results show that liposomal systems carrying ZtEO may be a potential alternative for gliobastoma treatment.	Zanthoxylum sesquiterpene
2	Inhibitory effect of phytoglycoprotein (24kDa) on allergy-related factors in compound 48/80-induced mast cells in vivo and in vitro.Mast cells are involved in immediate allergic reactions such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis. Allergic reactions caused by extracellular allergens such as xenobiotics may become a critical problem in living circumstances. Recently, we isolated and purified glycoprotein from Zanthoxylum piperitum DC fruit (ZPDC), and demonstrated that ZPDC glycoprotein (5-20mg/kg, 25-100mug/ml) has an inhibitory effect on allergy-related mediators in the compound 48/80-treated BALB/c and human mast cells (HMC-1 cells). Our results obtained from this study showed that ZPDC glycoprotein (10mg/kg) inhibited interleukin-4 (IL-4), immunoglobulin E (IgE), and histamine are released in mouse serum. Also, ZPDC glycoprotein (50mug/ml) attenuated the degranulation of mast cells, intracellular Ca(2+) levels, and the activities of phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB (p50 and p65), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the HMC-1 cells. Taken together, we speculate that the ZPDC glycoprotein might be one component found in natural products that has the ability to prevent dysfunction in the immune system caused by several different allergens.	zanthoxylum piperitum atopic dermatitis
2	Protection of NMDA-induced neuronal cell damage by methanol extract of zizyphi spinosi semen in cultured rat cerebellar granule cells.Zizypus is one of the herbs widely used in Korea and China due to the CNS calming effect. The present study aims to investigate the effect of the methanol extract of Zizyphi Spinosi Semen (ZSS), the seeds of Zizyphus jujuba Mill var. spinosa, on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced neurotoxicity in cultured rat cerebellar granule neuron. ZSS, over a concentration range of 0.05-5 microg/ml, inhibited NMDA (1 mM)-induced neuronal cell death, which was measured by a trypan blue exclusion test and a 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. ZSS (0.5 microg/ml) inhibited glutamate release into medium induced by NMDA (1mM), which was measured by HPLC. Pretreatment of ZSS (0.5 microg/ml) inhibited NMDA (1mM)-induced elevation of cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](c)), which was measured by a fluorescent dye, Fura 2-AM, and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These results suggest that ZSS prevents NMDA-induced neuronal cell damage in vitro.	zizyphus jujuba neurotoxicity
2	In vitro antimicrobial activity of extracts from plants used traditionally in South Africa to treat tuberculosis and related symptoms.Respiratory ailments are major human killers, especially in developing countries. Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease causing a threat to human healthcare. Many South African plants are used in the traditional treatment of TB and related symptoms, but there has not been a sufficient focus on evaluating their antimicrobial properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of plants used traditionally to treat TB and related symptoms against microorganisms (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Mycobacterium aurum A+) associated with respiratory infections using the microdilution assay. Ten plants were selected based on a survey of available literature of medicinal plants used in South Africa for the treatment of TB and related symptoms. The petroleum ether, dichloromethane, 80% ethanol, and water extracts of the selected plants were evaluated for antibacterial activity. Out of 68 extracts tested from different parts of the 10 plant species, 17 showed good antimicrobial activities against at least one or more of the microbial strains tested, with minimum inhibitory concentration ranging from 0.195 to 12.5 mg/mL. The good antimicrobial properties of Abrus precatorius, Terminalia phanerophlebia, Indigofera arrecta, and Pentanisia prunelloides authenticate their traditional use in the treatment of respiratory diseases. Thus, further pharmacological and phytochemical analysis is required.	abrus precatorius respiratory diseases
2	Effect of abrin on cell-mediated immune responses in mice.Effect of abrin isolated from Abrus precatorius on the cellular immune responses was studied in normal as well as tumor-bearing animals. Administration of abrin was found to enhance the proliferation of splenocytes and thymocytes (lymphocytes in general) in responses to mitogens. Natural killer cell activity was enhanced significantly by abrin in both the normal (49.8% cell lysis on day 9) and the tumor-bearing group (51.7% cell lysis on day 9), and it was found to be earlier than the control. Antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity was enhanced in the abrin treated tumor-bearing group on the ninth day (44% cell lysis). An early antibody dependent complement mediated cytotoxicity was observed in the abrin treated group on day 15 (27.6% cell lysis). Results of our present study suggest the immunomodulatory property of abrin.	abrus precatorius tumor
4	Regulation of Caspase-3 and Bcl-2 Expression in Dalton's Lymphoma Ascites Cells by Abrin.The role of abrin, a toxic lectin isolated from seeds of Abrus precatorius Linn in inducing apoptosis in murine Dalton's Lymphoma Ascites (DLA) cells was evaluated. Abrin when incubated at the concentration of 10 ng per million DLA cells could bring about cell death as typical morphological changes with apoptosis. However, necrotic cell death dominated when a higher dose of abrin was used. DNA samples, isolated from DLA cells treated with abrin showed fragmentation. Abrin brought about induction of apoptosis by stimulating the expression of pro-apoptotic Caspase-3, at the same time blocking the expression of Bcl-2, which is an anti apoptotic gene. However, the expression of tumor suppressor gene p53 has not been observed in control and abrin-treated DLA cells. Results suggested that abrin effectively induced apoptotic changes in the tumor cells that led to cellular death.	Bcl-2 tumor
1	Effect of drying of jujubes (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) on the contents of sugars, organic acids, alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene, and phenolic compounds.This study investigated the changes in sugars, organic acids, alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene, phenolic profiles, total phenolic content (TPC), and antioxidant capacity of jujube fruits after four drying treatments (sun-, oven-, microwave- and freeze-drying). Sugar, organic acid, phenolic compounds, alpha-tocopherol, and beta-carotene were qualitatived and quantitatived by high-performance liquid chromatography. The TPC and antioxidant activity of jujube samples were evaluated using the Folin-Ciocalteau method and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical scavenging activity, respectively. Freeze-drying resulted in jujubes with higher antioxidant activity and was also a good choice for the preparation of beta-carotene from jujubes for the food industry. Microwave-dried jujubes had a higher content of protocatechuic acid, catechin, and epicatechin and maintained the same antioxidant capacity with the freeze-dried jujubes. The combination of microwave- and freeze-drying may be an efficient alternative with shorter processing time and, consequently, less impact on the nutritional value of the jujube.	jujube epicatechin
1	SPE-HPLC method for the determination of four flavonols in rat plasma and urine after oral administration of Abelmoschus manihot extract.A SPE-HPLC method was developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of flavonols, isoquercitrin (1), hibifolin (2), myricetin (3), quercetin-3'-O-d-glucoside (4) and quercetin (5) in rat plasma and urine after oral administration of the total flavonoids from Abelmoschus manihot (TFA). The astragalin (6) and kaempferol (7) were used as internal standards (IS). Plasma and urine samples were pretreated by solid-phase extraction using Winchem C(18) reversed-phase cartridges. Analysis of the plasma and urinary extract was performed on YMC-Pack ODS-A C(18) and Thermo ODS-2HYEPRSIL C(18) reversed-phase column, respectively and a mobile phase of acetonitrile-0.1% phosphoric acid was employed. HPLC analysis was conducted with different elution gradients. The flow rate was 1.0 mL/min and the detection wavelength was set at 370 nm. Calibration ranges in plasma for flavonols 2-5 were at 0.011-2.220, 0.014-2.856, 0.022-4.320, and 0.028-5.600 microg/mL, respectively. In urine calibration ranges for flavonols 1, 2, 4 and 5 were at 2.00-16.00, 8.56-102.72, 2.70-21.60, and 3.00-24.00 microg/mL, respectively. The RSD of intra- and inter-day was less than 5.40% and 4.89% in plasma, and less than 3.96% and 6.85% in urine for all the analyses. A preliminary experiment to investigate the plasma concentration and urinary excretion of the flavonols after oral administration of TFA to rats demonstrated that the present method was suitable for determining the flavonols in rat plasma and urine.	abelmoschus manihot quercetin
1	Cytotoxic mannopyranosides of indole alkaloids from Zanthoxylum nitidum.Three new mannopyranosides of indole alkaloids, methyl 7-(beta-D-mannopyranosyloxy)-1H-indole-2-carboxylate (1), methyl 7-[(3-O-acetyl-beta-D-mannopyranosyl)oxy]-1H-indole-2-carboxylate (2), and 2-methyl-1H-indol-7-yl beta-D-mannopyranoside (3), were isolated from an EtOH extract of the roots of Zanthoxylum nitidum. Their structures were identified as new compounds on the basis of the spectroscopic analyses. Bioactivity evaluation revealed that these alkaloids possess significant cytotoxicities against all the tested tumor cell lines with IC50 values of less than 30 muM. 	zanthoxylum nitidum mannopyranosides
1	Influence of Binasal and Uninasal Inhalations of Essential Oil of Abies koreana Twigs on Electroencephalographic Activity of Human.Objectives. The present work investigates the effect of essential oil from the twigs of Abies koreana on electroencephalographic (EEG) activity of human brain in order to understand the influence of binasal and uninasal inhalations. Methods. To accomplish this study, the essential oil from the twigs of A. koreana (AEO) was isolated by steam distillation and the EEG readings were recorded using QEEG-8 system from 8 grounding electrodes according to the International 10-20 System. Results. D-Limonene (25.29%), bornyl acetate (19.31%), camphene (12.48%), alpha-pinene (11.88%), beta-pinene (6.45%), and eudesm-7(11)-en-ol (5.38%) were the major components in the essential oil. In the EEG study, the absolute alpha (left frontal and right parietal) and absolute fast alpha (right parietal) values significantly increased during the binasal inhalation of AEO. In the uninasal inhalation, absolute beta and theta values decreased significantly, especially in the right frontal and left and right parietal regions. The results revealed that the AEO produced different EEG power spectrum changes according to the nostril difference. Conclusion. The changes in EEG values due to the inhalation of AEO may contribute to the enhancement of relaxation (binasal inhalation) and alertness/attention (right uninasal inhalation) states of brain which could be used in aromatherapy treatments.	a. koreana camphene
1	Crystal structure of abrin-a at 2.14 A.The crystal structure of abrin-a, a type II ribosome-inactivating protein from the seeds of Abrus precatorius, has been determined from a novel crystalline form by the molecular replacement method using the coordinates of ricin. The structure has been refined at 2.14 A to a R-factor of 18.9%. The root-mean-square deviations of bond lengths and angles from the standard values are 0.013 A and 1.82 degrees, respectively. The overall protein folding is similar to that of ricin, but there are differences in the secondary structure, mostly of the A-chain. Several parts of the molecular surface differ significantly; some of them are quite near the active site cleft, and probably influence ribosome recognition. The positions of invariant active site residues remain the same, except the position of Tyr74. Two water molecules of hydrogen-bonded active site residues have been located in the active site cleft. Both of them may be responsible for hydrolyzing the N-C glycosidic bond. The current abrin-a structure is lactose free; this is probably essential for abrin-a crystallization. The B-chain is a glycoprotein, and the positions of several sugar residues of two sugar chains linked to earlier predicted glycosylation sites were determined. One of the sugar chains is a bridge between two neighboring molecules, since one of its mannose residues is connected to the galactose binding site of the neighboring molecule. Another sugar chain covers the surface of the B-chain.	abrus precatorius galactose
2	HPLC method for measurement of human salivary alpha-amylase inhibition by aqueous plant extracts.Control of hyperglycemia is an important treatment in metabolic disorders such as type II diabetes and obesity. alpha-Amylase, as the first enzyme of glucose release from dietary polysaccharides, is a potential target to identify new sources of novel anti-obesity and anti-diabetic drugs. In this work, different herbal extracts as alpha-amylase inhibitors were studied by measuring the rate of the cleavage of a maltooligomer substrate 2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl-beta-D-maltoheptoside. Measurement of chromophore containing products after reversed phase HPLC separation was used for alpha-amylase activity measurement. Rates of hydrolysis catalysed by human salivary alpha-amylase were determined in the presence and absence of lyophilised water extracts of eleven herbs. Remarkable bioactivities were found for extracts of Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume (bark), Camellia sinensis L. (leaf), Ribes nigrum L. (leaf), Laurus nobilis L. (leaf), Vaccinium macrocarpon Aiton (fruit) and Syzygium aromaticum L. (bud). Determined IC50 values were in 0.017-41 mug/ml range for these six selected plant extracts. Our results confirm the applicability of this HPLC-based method for the quick and reliable comparison of plants as alpha-amylase inhibitors.	ribes nigrum l type ii diabetes
1	Two new geranylphenylacetate glycosides from the barks of Cinnamomum cassia.Two new glycosides, cinnacassides F (1) and G (2), with a rare geranylphenylacetate carbon skeleton, were isolated from the barks of Cinnamomum cassia, along with three known analogues, cinnacassides A (3), B (4) and C (5). The structures of the new compounds were elucidated on the basis of extensive NMR spectroscopic analyses and chemical method. Compounds 1-5 were investigated for their immunomodulatory activities, and compounds 1, 3 and 4 showed differential immunosuppressive activities against murine lymphocytes.	cinnamomum cassia cinnacassides

2	The potential of cinnamon to reduce blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance.AIM: Cinnamon has a long history as an antidiabetic spice, but trials involving cinnamon supplementation have produced contrasting results. The aim of this review was to examine the results of randomized controlled clinical trials of cinnamon and evaluate the therapeutic potential amongst patients with diabetes and insulin-resistant patients, particularly the ability to reduce blood glucose levels and inhibit protein glycation. METHODS: A systematic electronic literature search using the medical subject headings 'cinnamon' and 'blood glucose' was carried out to include randomized, placebo-controlled in vivo clinical trials using Cinnamomum verum or Cinnamomum cassia conducted between January 2003 and July 2008. RESULTS: Five type 2 diabetic and three non-diabetic studies (total N = 311) were eligible. Two of the diabetic studies illustrated significant fasting blood glucose (FBG) reductions of 18-29% and 10.3% (p &lt; 0.05), supported by one non-diabetic trial reporting an 8.4% FBG reduction (p &lt; 0.01) vs. placebo, and another illustrating significant reductions in glucose response using oral glucose tolerance tests (p &lt; 0.05). Three diabetic studies reported no significant results. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst definitive conclusions cannot be drawn regarding the use of cinnamon as an antidiabetic therapy, it does possess antihyperglycaemic properties and potential to reduce postprandial blood glucose levels. Further research is required to confirm a possible correlation between baseline FBG and blood glucose reduction and to assess the potential to reduce pathogenic diabetic complications with cinnamon supplementation.	cinnamon diabetic
2	[Pathogenic factor (Dampness-heat) of glomerulopathy].Mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (MsPGN) induced by chronic serum sickness in rabbits coincide with the human chronic progressive glomerulonephritis resulted from repeated infection, which is similar to pathologic changes of Dampness-Heat Syndrome. The experimental model of MsPGN was treated by Abelmoschus manihot. which could remove the Dampness-Heat. The amount of proteinuria in treating and control group were 62.68mg/24hr and 121.94mg/24hr respectively (P &lt; 0.05), the number of cells in glomeruli were 61.54 and 80.39 respectively (P &lt; 0.01), and diameters of glomeruli were 102.43 microns and 121.13 microns respectively (P &lt; 0.01). It suggested that the drug could alleviate circulating immune complex (CIC) mediated renal injury.	abelmoschus manihot renal injury
2	Evaluation of natural products on inhibition of inducible cyclooxygenase (COX-2) and nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in cultured mouse macrophage cells.The inhibitors of prostaglandin biosynthesis and nitric oxide production have been considered as potential anti-inflammatory and cancer chemopreventive agents. In this study, we evaluated approximately 170 methanol extracts of natural products including Korean herbal medicines for the inhibition of prostaglandin E(2) production (for COX-2 inhibitors) and nitric oxide formation (for iNOS inhibitors) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophages RAW264.7 cells. As a result, several extracts such as Aristolochia debilis, Cinnamomum cassia, Cinnamomum loureirii, Curcuma zedoaria, Eugenia caryophyllata, Pterocarpus santalius, Rehmania glutinosa and Tribulus terrestris showed potent inhibition of COX-2 activity (&gt;80% inhibition at the test concentration of 10 micro g/ml). In addition, the extracts of A. debilis, Caesalpinia sappan, Curcuma longa, C. zedoaria, Daphne genkwa and Morus alba were also considered as potential inhibitors of iNOS activity (&gt;70% inhibition at the test concentration of 10 micro g/ml). These active extracts mediating COX-2 and iNOS inhibitory activities are warranted for further elucidation of active principles for development of new cancer chemopreventive and/or anti-inflammatory agents.	tribulus terrestris cancer
2	Stimulatory effects of extract prepared from the bark of Cinnamomum cassia blume on the function of osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells.The ethanol extract from the bark of Cinnamomum cassia Blume (CCE) was tested for estrogenic activity. CCE (4-60 microg/mL) significantly induced the growth of MCF-7 cells, an ER-positive human breast cancer cell line, over that of untreated control cells (p &lt; 0.05). In the ER competitive binding assay, CCE showed higher affinity with ERbeta compared with ERalpha. To investigate the bioactivities of CCE, which act on bone metabolism, the effects of CCE on the function of osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells and the production of local factors in osteoblasts were studied. CCE (4-60 microg/mL) dose-dependently increased the survival of MC3T3-E1 cells. In addition, CCE (10 and 50 microg/mL) increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, collagen synthesis and osteocalcin secretion in MC3T3-E1 cells. Treatment with CCE (10 and 50 microg/mL) prevented apoptosis induced by TNF-alpha (10(-10) m) in osteoblastic cells. In the presence of TNF-alpha, culture with CCE (10-100 microg/mL) for 48 h inhibited the production of IL-6 and nitric oxide in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. These results suggest that Cinnamomum cassia has a direct stimulatory effect on bone formation in vitro and may contribute to the prevention of osteoporosis and inflammatory bone diseases.	cinnamomum cassia osteoporosis
2	Anxiolytic effect of seed of Ziziphus jujuba in mouse models of anxiety.The aim of the present study was to investigate the ethanolic extract of Semen Ziziphi jujuba (SZJE) induced anxiolytic effect. The SZJE was orally administered to male ICR mice, at 0.5, 1.0 and 2. 0 g/kg, 30 min before the behavioral evaluation in the black and white test (BWT) and elevated plus maze (EPM). The SZJE at the dosage 0.5-2.0 g/kg increased the first time entry, total changes and times spent in the white chamber of the BWT. The SZJE at the dosage 0.5-1.0 g/kg increased the percentage of time-spent and the percentage of arm entries in the open arms of the EPM and decreased the percentage of time-spent and the percentage of arm entries in the closed arms of the EPM. Furthermore, the SZJE at the dosage of 1. 0 g/kg prolonged the hexobarbital-induced sleeping time in mice and decreased the locomotor activity in rats. These results suggested that SZJE possessed anxiolytic effect at lower dose and sedative effect at higher dose.	ziziphus jujuba anxiety
2	Purification and dose-dependent toxicity study of abrin in swiss albino male mice.Abrin, a phytotoxin obtained from the seeds of the Abrus precatorius plant, is highly toxic with an estimated human fatal dose of 0.1:1 mug/kg. In this study, abrin was purified and characterized through SDS PAGE and mass spectrometry analysis; further study on toxicity was carried out to investigate the alteration in biochemical, and hematological variables through histopathological observations in mice. The intraperitoneal LD50 value of purified abrin for mice was found to be 0.91mug/kg of body weight. Mice were exposed to 0.4 and 1.0 LD50 abrin doses intraperitoneally and observed on days 1, 3, and 7. Plasma GOT and GPT levels increased significantly at both doses. At 1.0 LD50 dose, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, urea, uric acid, and creatinine levels increased, whereas albumin, total protein, glucose and cholesterol levels decreased significantly. Abrin intoxication also altered the hemoglobin, WBC, and RBC counts significantly at 1.0 LD50 dose. Liver GSH levels decreased while lipid peroxidation increased significantly in a dose:dependent manner. Biochemical changes were supported by the histological investigation, which also showed the degenerative changes in organs. In conclusion, abrin intoxication caused toxic effects and severe damages on studied organs mediated through alteration in biochemical and hematological variables, lipid peroxidation, and degeneration.	abrus precatorius toxicity
1	Cell wall lignin is polymerised by class III secretable plant peroxidases in Norway spruce.Class III secretable plant peroxidases occur as a large family of genes in plants with many functions and probable redundancy. In this review we are concentrating on the evidence we have on the catalysis of lignin polymerization by class III plant peroxidases present in the apoplastic space in the xylem of trees. Some evidence exists on the specificity of peroxidase isozymes in lignin polymerization through substrate specificity studies, from antisense mutants in tobacco and poplar and from tissue and cell culture lines of Norway spruce (Picea abies) and Zinnia elegans. In addition, real time (RT-)PCR results have pointed out that many peroxidases have tissue specific expression patterns in Norway spruce. Through combining information on catalytic properties of the enzymes, on the expression patterns of the corresponding genes, and on the presence of monolignols and hydrogen peroxide in the apoplastic space, we can show that specific peroxidases catalyze lignin polymerization in the apoplastic space of Norway spruce xylem.	norway spruce lignin
2	Secondary metabolites from the root wood of Zanthoxylum wutaiense and their antitubercular activity.Bioassay-guided fractionation of the root wood of Zanthoxylum wutaiense led to the isolation of five new compounds, wutaipyranol A (1), 8-methoxywutaipyranol A (2), demethoxywutaiensal (3), demethoxywutaiensol (4), and dihydrodemethoxywutaiensol (5), together with six known compounds. Their structures were elucidated by 1D- and 2D-NMR, as well as MS analyses. Among the isolates, wutaipyranol A (1), 8-methoxywutaipyranol A (2), and demethoxywutaiensal (3) exhibited antitubercular activities against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H(37) Rv in vitro, with MIC values of 52.4, 55.6, and 45.8 mug/ml, respectively.	zanthoxylum wutaiense demethoxywutaiensol
2	Network pharmacology-based research uncovers cold resistance and thermogenesis mechanism of Cinnamomum cassia.BACKGROUND: Cinnamomum cassia (L.) J.Presl (Cinnamon) was known as a kind of hot herb, improved circulation and warmed the body. However, the active components and mechanisms of dispelling cold remain unknown. METHODS: The effects of several Chinses herbs on thermogenesis were evaluated on body temperature and activation of brown adipose tissue. After confirming the effect, the components of cinnamon were identified using HPLC-Q-TOF/MS and screened with databases. The targets of components were obtained with TCMSP, SymMap, Swiss and STITCH databases. Thermogenesis genes were predicted with DisGeNET and GeneCards databases. The protein-protein interaction network was constructed with Cytoscape 3.7.1 software. GO enrichment analysis was accomplished with STRING databases. KEGG pathway analysis was established with Omicshare tools. The top 20 targets for four compounds were obtained according to the number of edges of PPI network. In addition, the network results were verified with experimental research for the effects of extracts and major compounds. RESULTS: Cinnamon extract significantly upregulated the body temperature during cold exposure.121 components were identified in HPLC-Q-TOF/MS. Among them, 60 compounds were included in the databases. 116 targets were obtained for the compounds, and 41 genes were related to thermogenesis. The network results revealed that 27 active ingredients and 39 target genes. Through the KEGG analysis, the top 3 pathways were PPAR signaling pathway, AMPK signaling pathway, thermogenesis pathway. The thermogenic protein PPARgamma, UCP1 and PGC1-alpha was included in the critical targets of four major compounds. The three major compounds increased the lipid consumption and activated the brown adipocyte. They also upregulated the expression of UCP1, PGC1-alpha and pHSL, especially 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde was confirmed the effect for the first time. Furthermore, cinnamaldehyde and cinnamon activated the expression of TRPA1 on DRG cells. CONCLUSION: The mechanisms of cinnamon on cold resistance were investigated with network pharmacology and experiment validation. This work provided research direction to support the traditional applications of thermogenesis.	cinnamon dispelling cold
3	Stimulatory effect of Cinnamomum cassia and cinnamic acid on angiogenesis through up-regulation of VEGF and Flk-1/KDR expression.Complementary and alternative medicine, Cinnamomum cassia is one of the medicinal plants that have been used to improve various diseases caused by insufficient blood circulation. However, relatively little work has been carried out on the angiogenic responses of C. cassia and its active compound cinnamic acid (CA), despite its excellent pharmacological action. In this study, we study the effect of the ethanol extract of C. cassia (CCE) and its active compound CA, on angiogenic processes in in vitro and in vivo. In the Matrigel plug assay in vivo, CCE and CA dose dependently increased von Willebrand Factor (vWF) antigen expression, and hemoglobin contents, whose elevation paralleled the onset of angiogenesis and was considered an early indicator of endothelial activation. CCE and CA induced endothelial cells proliferation, migration and tubule-like structure in vitro. The 25-50% increase observed with CCE (at low doses of 1 or 10 ng/ml) in HUVEC and BAEC proliferation was similar to that observed with CA. The migration and tubule-like structure effect were observed with HUVEC and BAEC. However, the effect of CCE, CA and VEGF on cell proliferation, migration and tubule-like structure in HUVEC were bigger than the effect of CCE, CA and VEGF in BAEC. In addition, CCE and CA each induced 2.2-fold and 2.5-fold increases the production of VEGF, the mRNA expression of VEGF and Flk-1/KDR, the receptor involved in proliferation, migration, and tubule-like structure of endothelial cells. These data suggest that CCE and its active compound CA induce angiogenesis in vivo and in vitro, and this pathway is related with VEGF and Flk-1/KDR expression of endothelial cells.	cinnamic acid von willebrand factor
2	In vitro anti-Helicobacter pylori action of 30 Chinese herbal medicines used to treat ulcer diseases.Infection by Helicobacter pylori has been ascertained to be an important etiologic impetus leading usually to chronic active gastritis and gastric ulcer with growing incidences worldwide. Utilizing as the test pathogen a standard and five clinic strains of Helicobacter pylori, the antibacterial action was assessed in vitro with ethanol extracts of 30 Chinese herbal medicines which have been frequently prescribed since ancient times for treating gastritis-like disorders. Among the 30 tested materials, the ethanol extracts of Abrus cantoniensis (Fabaceae), Saussurea lappa (Asteraceae) and Eugenia caryophyllata (Myrtaceae) were strongly inhibitory to all test strains (MICs: approximately 40 microg/ml), and Hippophae rhamnoides (Elaeagnaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii (Liliaceae), Magnolia officinalis and Schisandra chinensis (Magnoliaceae), Corydalis yanhusuo (Papaveraceae), Citrus reticulata (Rutaceae), Bupleurum chinense and Ligusticum chuanxiong (Apiaceae) substantially active with MICs close to 60.0 microg/ml. As to antibacterial actions of the aqueous extracts of the same drugs, those derived from Cassia obtusifolia (Fabaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii and Eugenia caryophyllata were remarkably inhibitory against all the six Helicobacter pylori strains (MICs: approximately 60 microg/ml). The work compared almost quantitatively the magnitude of the anti-Helicobacter pylori actions of the 30 most prescribed gastritis-treating Chinese herbal drugs, and located as well some source plants where potent anti-Helicobacter pylori phytochemicals could be characterized.	cassia obtusifolia gastric ulcer
2	Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology of Ziziphus jujuba Mills.Ziziphus jujuba Mills, 'annab' in Iran, 'ber' in India or 'pomme sourette' in France, is a species whose fruit (known warmly as 'the fruits of life' in China) has been consumed for centuries for its nutritional value. The food industry used it as a food additive and flavoring. The dry seeds, the crude leaves and the stem bark are still used in ethnopharmacology to treat digestive disorders and gastric ulcers as antitussive, laxative and hypotensive drugs; even now, it is used in China to treat children who suffer from typhoid fever, furuncle and ecthyma. In Taiwan, the dry seeds for the variety spinosa (Suan Zao Ren) are the second most commonly prescribed and used phytomedicine for insomnia. Its popularity and production have increased worldwide in recent years, especially in Europe. The European Pharmacopoeia Commission has been unable to elaborate upon the EP monograph on Ziziphi spinosae semen as was planned. The EMA has not made its recommendations yet. Is it still a gap in the scientific knowledge? Or is difficult for traditional Chinese medicinal herbs to fulfill the style and quality parameters that are required?

1	Composition of essential oils from seeds of Abies koreana.The essential oils from seeds of nine Abies koreana specimens have been studied using GC-MS-FID and NMR methods, leading to the determination of 96 volatiles, which constituted over 99% of the oils. The hydrodistilled oils of fresh, resinous scent were isolated with yields in the range of 3.8-8.5%. The results showed that the essential oil of Korean fir seeds contained 70-95% monoterpenes and 1-20% oxygenated monoterpenes as the dominant groups. The numerous sesquiterpenes, diterpenes and their oxygenated derivatives constituted only 2-8% of the oil. The major component of the seed essential oil was limonene (41-72 g/100g); the laevorotary form of this terpene predominated. A. koreana seeds seem to be a rich source of both essential oil and (-)-limonene, whose average enantiomeric excess was above 95%.	a. koreana diterpenes
1	High-performance liquid chromatography--two wavelength detection of triterpenoid acids from the fruits of Ziziphus jujuba containing various cultivars in different regions and classification using chemometric analysis.A simple and sensitive HPLC-DAD method has been developed for the first time to simultaneously determine 10 triterpenoid acids (ceanothic acid, alphitolic acid, zizyberanal acid, zizyberanalic acid, epiceanothic acid, ceanothenic acid, betulinic acid, oleanolic acid, ursonic acid and zizyberenalic acid) in the dried fruit of Ziziphus jujuba (called Dazao) which has been widely used as one of the traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs). This HPLC assay was performed on a reversed-phase C(18) column (250 mm x 4.6mm, 5 microm) with the column temperature at 35 degrees C. The mobile phase was composed of A (acetonitrile) and B (0.05% aqueous phosphoric acid, v/v). The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min and the detection wave length was set at 205 nm for reference compounds 1-9 and 238 nm for reference compound 10. All calibration curves showed good linear regression (r(2)&gt;0.9999) within the test range. The established method showed good precision and accuracy with overall intra-day and inter-day variations of 0.43-1.72% and 0.53-2.45%, respectively, and overall recoveries of 94.98-104.09% for the 10 compounds analyzed. The validated method was successfully applied for the simultaneous determination of the 10 triterpenoid acids in 42 batches of Dazao which contained 36 cultivars from 22 cultivation regions, and were investigated and authenticated as Z. jujuba. Hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) and principal components analysis (PCA) were performed to differentiate and classify the samples based on the contents of the 10 triterpenoid acids. The presented HPLC-DAD method conjugated with chemometrics approach was demonstrated to be very helpful in using Dazao resources, and was possibly useful in chemotaxonomic characterization.	z. jujuba oleanolic acid
2	The ability of an ethanol extract of Cinnamomum cassia to inhibit Src and spleen tyrosine kinase activity contributes to its anti-inflammatory action.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Cinnamomum cassia Blume (Aceraceae) has been traditionally used to treat various inflammatory diseases such as gastritis. However, the anti-inflammatory mechanism of Cinnamomum cassia has not been fully elucidated. This study examined the anti-inflammatory mechanism of 95% ethanol extract (Cc-EE) of Cinnamomum cassia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effect of Cc-EE on the production of inflammatory mediators in RAW264.7 cells and peritoneal macrophages was investigated. Molecular mechanisms underlying the effects, especially inhibitory effects, was elucidated by analyzing the activation of transcription factors and their upstream signaling, and by evaluating the kinase activity of target enzymes. RESULTS: Cc-EE of Cinnamomum cassia diminished the production of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and prostaglandin (PG)E(2), in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated RAW264.7 cells and peritoneal macrophages in a dose-dependent manner. Cc-EE also blocked mRNA expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, and TNF-alpha by suppressing the activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, and simultaneously inhibited its upstream inflammatory signaling cascades, including spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and Src. Consistent with these findings, the extract directly blocked the kinase activities of Src and Syk. CONCLUSION: Cc-EE exerts strong anti-inflammatory activity by suppressing Src/Syk-mediated NF-kappaB activation, which contributes to its major ethno-pharmacological role as an anti-gastritis remedy. Future work will be focused on determining whether the extract can be further developed as an anti-inflammatory drug.	cinnamomum cassia gastritis
1	Total flavones of abelmoschus manihot enhances angiogenic ability both in vitro and in vivo.Angiogenesis is a process of new blood vessel formation from pre-existing vessels. It is a normal and vital process in growth and development, as well as in wound healing and in the formation of granulation tissue. Total flavones of Abelmoschus manihot (TFA) are the major constituents of the traditional Chinese herb Abelmoschus manihot L. Medic. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of TFA on angiogenic ability using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro and chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) in vivo. HUVECs were treated with TFA at different concentrations. Cell viability, cell cycle progression, cell apoptosis, cell migration and tubular formation were investigated. The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and kinase insert domain receptor (KDR, VEGFR-2) was examined by immunohistochemistry to identify mechanism of action of TFA. CAM model was used to evaluate the effect of TFA on angiogenesis in vivo. Our results showed that TFA promoted HUVECs proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. It increased HUVECs migratory ability and the number of tubular structure, promoted vessel formation in HUVECs culture and CAM model. Furthermore, TFA treatment resulted in a decrease in cell apoptosis and enhanced the expression of VEGF and KDR. Taken together, TFA, as the major active component isolated from the traditional Chinese herb Abelmoschus manihot L. Medic, could enhance angiogenic ability of HUVECs in vitro and CAM in vivo. TFA may be used in the treatment of wound healing and ischemic/reperfusion injuries.	abelmoschus manihot flavones
1	Higher extracellular pH suppresses tracheary element differentiation by affecting auxin uptake.In an optimized liquid medium containing auxin and cytokinin, mesophyll cells isolated from Zinnia elegans L. seedlings can be induced to differentiate into tracheary elements (TEs) at high frequency. However, it is known that buffering the medium at neutral pH severely suppresses TE differentiation. In the process of modifying the medium, we found that excessive administration of auxin restored the suppression. Based on this finding, we physiologically characterized auxin actions involved in TE differentiation by focusing on the influence of extracellular pH. First, dose/response relationships between auxin [1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)] concentrations and differentiated cell ratios were determined under various extracellular pH conditions. Secondly, intracellular concentrations of free forms and metabolites of auxin species were determined by analyzing extracts from cells cultured with radiolabeled NAA and 2,4-D under different extracellular pH conditions with liquid scintillation counting and thin-layer chromatography autoradiograms. Higher extracellular pH was found to reduce both the auxin potency for inducing TE differentiation and intracellular auxin accumulation. Reduction levels correlatively varied depending on the auxin species. These results suggest that the weakening in auxin potency at higher extracellular pH is ascribed to lower auxin uptake, which leads to decreased intracellular perception of the auxin signal. A model to predict auxin action that considers membrane transport, metabolism, and the perception of auxin is also presented.	zinnia elegans 2,4-D
1	Evaluation of relaxant responses properties of cinnamon essential oil and its major component, cinnamaldehyde on human and rat corpus cavernosum.Cinnamomum cassia (Cinnamon) is a well-known traditional medicine with therapeutic benefits for centuries. We evaluated the effects of cinnamon essential oil (CEO) and its main component cinnamaldehyde (CA) on human corpus cavernosum (HCC) and rat CC. The essential oil of cinnamon was analyzed for the confirmation of the oil profile. HCC specimens from patients undergoing penile prosthesis surgery (age 48-69 years) were utilized for functional studies. In addition, erectile responses in anesthetized control and diabetic rats were evaluated in vivo after intracavernosal injection of CEO and CA, and rat CC strips were placed in organ baths. After precontraction with phenylephrine (10muM), relaxant responses to CEO and CA were investigated. CA (96.9%) was found as the major component. The maximum relaxation responses to CEO and CA were 96.4+-3.5% and 96.0+-5.0% in HCC and 97.5+-5.5% and 96.8+-4.8% in rat CC, respectively. There was no difference between control and diabetic rats in relaxation responses to CEO and CA. The relaxant responses obtained with essential oil and CA were not attenuated in the presence of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, and soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor (sGS) in CC. In vivo, erectile responses in diabetic rats were lower than in control rats, which was restored after intracavernosal injection of CEO and CA. CEO and CA improved erectile function and relaxation of isolated strips of rat CC and HCC by a NO/cGMP-independent mechanism. Further investigations are warranted to fully elucidate the restorative effects of CEO and CA on diabetic erectile dysfunction.	cinnamomum cassia cinnamaldehyde
1	Characterization and biological evaluation of six new dimeric lignans with an unusual alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone motif from Zanthoxylum simulans.Investigation of the bark of Zanthoxylum simulans afforded six new dimeric lignans zanthpodocarpins C-H (1-6) bearing an unusual alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone group. The new structures of 1-6 were determined by using detailed spectroscopic analysis. All of the isolated compounds were examined for their inhibitory effects against rat joint synovial cell and splenocyte proliferation. Compounds 1-6 showed potent anti-inflammatory activities with IC50 values ranging from 18.6 to 36.1muM, and 13.8 to 74.3muM. 	zanthoxylum simulans lignans
1	Zizimauritic acids A-C, three novel nortriterpenes from Ziziphus mauritiana.Zizimauritic acids A-C (1-3), three novel nortriterpenes with a unique A-nor-E-seco spiro-lactone ceanothane-type triterpene skeleton, together with 3 known triterpenes ceanothenic acid (4), betulinic acid (5), and ceanothic acid (6), were isolated from the roots of Ziziphus mauritiana. Compounds 1-4 showed cytotoxicities with the IC(50) values ranging from 5.05 to 11.94 mug/ml, and compounds 1 and 3 showed an inhibitory effect on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus with the IC(50) values 2.17 and 12.79 mug/ml. A plausible biosynthetic pathway of compounds 1-3 was proposed.	ziziphus mauritiana ceanothane
1	Identification of the potential active components of Abelmoschus manihot in rat blood and kidney tissue by microdialysis combined with ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry.In this paper, microdialysis combining with ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) was applied to simultaneously identify components in blood and kidney dialysis after oral administration of Abelmoschus manihot extract. Microdialysis probe was implanted in the jugular vein and the kidney medulla, respectively; microdialysis samples were collected continuously, transferred to microtubes and analyzed by UPLC-Q-TOF/MS. The components in microdialysis samples were separated by an UPLC HSS T3 column and eluted with acetonitrile and water (containing 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The results showed that unbound constituents in blood circulation of the rat include hyperoside, isoquercitrin, quercetin monoglucuronide, quercetin-3'-O-glucoside, quercetin, myricetin, and hibifolin while unbound constituents in kidney are hyperoside, isoquercitrin, quercetin monoglucuronide, which might be the potential active components in vivo. The developed method was simple and reliable, and could be adopted to rapidly screen and identify potential active components contributing to pharmacological effects of TCM and to better clarify its action mechanism.	abelmoschus manihot quercetin monoglucuronide
2	A nutraceutical combination of Cinnamomum cassia &amp;Nigella sativa for Type 1 diabetes mellitus.BACKGROUND: Nigella sativa (black cumin) and Cinnamomum cassia (Cinnamon) are an integral part of the Indian diet, and have also been sourced in the ayurveda, the traditional Indian system of medicine, for their medicinal properties. Both the herbs individually have been successfully evaluated for their preliminary antidiabetic potential. OBJECTIVE: Herein, we dived deeper into antidiabetic properties of these herbs, by investigating the combinatorial effect of both herbs, on parameters of diabetes and further, as an adjunct to metformin therapy, for assessing the pharmacodynamics of herb-drug interaction in diabetes mellitus. The objectives were to screen the combinatorial extract of Nigella sativa &amp; Cinnamomum cassia's (NSCCe) alone and in combination with metformin for its potential in mitigating symptoms of diabetes mellitus-alone, and as an adjunct therapy with metformin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Diabetes was induced in the animals by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. Animals were divided into seven groups with 6 animals each: Vehicle control, Negative control, Positive control (Metformin 50 mg/kg), treatment groups 4 and 5 received NSCCe at the doses of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg, respectively. Groups 6 and 7 received the same doses, in combination with Metformin (50 and 25 mg/kg). Following a 28-day dosing period, plasma glucose levels, lipid profile and renal function profile were evaluated. Histopathological examinations were performed to measure any morphological change in kidney, liver and pancreatic tissue. RESULTS: Combination of Nigella sativa &amp; Cinnamomum cassia extracts significantly normalized plasma glucose levels, lipid profile and kidney function parameters, compared to the diabetic control group. Animals treated with the combinatorial extract and metformin showed more prominent effects on these parameters. Significant reversal in the pancreatic cell damage was observed on treatment with NSCCe. CONCLUSION: This study generates evidence to support Nigella sativa &amp; Cinnamomum cassia as an adjunctive in diabetes treatment protocols.	cinnamomum cassia type 1 diabetes mellitus
3	Purification and characterization of a novel type i ribosome inactivating protein, pachyerosin, from Pachyrhizus erosus seeds, and preparation of its immunotoxin against human hepatoma cells.Pachyrhizus erosus seeds have a high protein content and are used in China due to their cytotoxic effect. Here we report the biological and pharmacological activity of the protein extracts from P. erosus seeds. A novel ribosome-inactivating protein, pachyerosin, from P. erosus seeds was successively purified to homogeneity using ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE-sepharose FF, and Sephacryl S-200. Pachyerosin showed to be a type I ribosome-inactivating protein with a molecular mass of 29 kDa and an isoelectric point of 9.19. It strongly inhibited protein synthesis of rabbit reticulocyte lysate with an IC50 of 0.37 ng/mL and showed N-glycosidase activity on rat liver ribosomes with an EC50 of 85.9 pM. The N-terminal 27 amino acids of pachyerosin revealed a 60.71% sequence identity with abrin A from the seeds of Abrus precatorius. With the aim of targeting the delivery of pachyerosin, immunotoxin was prepared by conjugating pachyerosin with anti-human AFP monoclonal antibodies SM0736. The immunotoxin pachyerosin-SM0736 efficiently inhibited the growth of the human hepatoma cell line HuH-7 with an IC50 of 0.050 +- 0.004 nM, 2360 times lower than that of pachyerosin and 430 times lower than that of the immunotoxin against human gastric cancer cell line SGC7901. These results imply that pachyerosin may be used as a new promising anticancer agent.	pachyerosin gastric cancer
2	Gastroprotective effect of aqueous stem bark extract of Ziziphus jujuba L. against HCl/Ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury in rats.OBJECTIVE: To evaluated the gastroprotective effects of standardized aqueous extract of Ziziphus jujuba (Z. jujuba) stem bark against acidified ethanol-induced gastric ulcers as well as anti helicobacter pylori activity of the plant extract in rats. METHODS: Five groups of rats were orally pre-treated with normal saline (0.9%) as ulcer group, 150 mg/kg of ranitidine as positive control group, 100, 200 and 400 mg of standardized extract solution as the experimental groups. Two hours later, acidified ethanol solution was given by gavages in order to induce of gastric ulcer. The antibacterial effect of extract against clinical strains of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) was evaluated through disc diffusion test. RESULTS: The ulcer group exhibited significantly severe mucosal injury as compared with ranitidine or extract group which shows significant protective action against gastric mucosal injury. The extract showed no effect on H. pylori. CONCLUSION: The present study indicates that Z. jujuba stem bark extract had a potential antiulcer activity which might be due to its protective activity, providing a direct, protective effect on the gastric mucosa. Our study showed that anti-H. pylori activity was not among gastroprotective mechanism of Z. jujuba. Further pre-clinical and clinical investigations for evaluating natural active agents and efficacy of this plant are recommended.	z. jujuba gastric mucosal injury
2	Development and validation of an LC-ESI-MS/MS method for the determination of nitidine chloride in rat plasma.A new liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass/mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) assay method has been developed and validated for the quantification of nitidine chloride (NC), an anti-cancer bioactive substance of Zanthoxylum nitidum (Roxb.) DC. plants, in rat plasma using carbamazepine as an internal standard (I.S.). The NC and I.S. were extracted from rat plasma by acetonitrile protein procedure. Chromatographic separation was carried out with a C(18) column (2.1 mm x 150 mm, 3 mum) with a security guard C18 column (4 mm x 20 mm, 3 mum). The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile-10 mM ammonium acetate buffer solution-formic acid (35:65:0.2, v/v/v) and delivered at the flow rate of 0.25 mL/min. LC-ESI-MS/MS was performed on a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry equipped with electrospray ionization (ESI) and positive multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). Target ions were monitored at [M](+)m/z 348.2 for NC and [M]+ m/z 237.2 for I.S. The method was linear over the concentration range of 5.0-1500.0 ng/mL. The intra- and inter-day relative standard deviations of the assay were less than 5.0%. The lower limit of quantification was 5.0 ng/mL. The developed method was successfully applied to the estimation of the pharmacokinetic parameters of NC by intravenous administration to rats.	zanthoxylum nitidum (roxb.) dc cancer
3	Structural characterization and cytotoxic properties of an apiose-rich pectic polysaccharide obtained from the cell wall of the marine phanerogam Zostera marina.Zosterin, an apiose-rich pectic polysaccharide, was extracted and purified from the sea grass Zostera marina. Structural studies conducted by gas chromatography and NMR spectroscopy on a purified zosterin fraction (AGU) revealed a typical apiogalacturonan structure comprising an alpha-1,4-d-galactopyranosyluronan backbone substituted by 1,2-linked apiofuranose oligosaccharides and single apiose residues. The average molecular mass of AGU was estimated to be about 4100 Da with a low polydispersity. AGU inhibited proliferation of A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells with an approximate IC(50) value of 3 microg/mL (0.7 microM). In addition, AGU inhibited A431 cell migration and invasion. Preliminary experiments showed that inhibition of metalloproteases expression could play a role in these antimigration and anti-invasive properties. Autohydrolysis of AGU, which eliminated apiose and oligo-apiose substituents, led to a virtual disappearance of cytotoxic properties, thus suggesting a direct structure-function relationship with the apiose-rich hairy region of AGU.	zosterin epidermoid carcinoma

1	Pressurized liquid extraction and GC-MS analysis for simultaneous determination of seven components in Cinnamomum cassia and the effect of sample preparation.A pressurized liquid extraction and GC-MS method was developed for simultaneous quantitative determination of the seven components, including cinnamaldehyde, copaene, cinnamic acid, coumarin, 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde, 2-methoxycinnamic acid and safrole in Cinnamomum cassia. The results showed that methanol and ethanol was not available for extraction of cinnamaldehyde and 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde due to aldol reaction. The developed method was validated to be sensitive, accurate and simple, and was successfully employed for the analysis of 15 samples of C. cassia. The contents of the investigated components were significantly variant and cinnamaldehyde is the most abundant compound, but safrole was not detected in all samples.	c. cassia cinnamic acid

3	Induction of apoptosis in HL-60 cells treated with medicinal herbs.In order to develop a new apoptosis inducer, we screened 22 crude drugs for their apoptosis-inducing activity. It was found that Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Cynomorium songaricum, Eucommia ulmoides, Phellodendron amurense, Cinnamomum cassia and Paeonia lactiflora induced the death of HL-60 cells. To investigate the mechanism of apoptosis induced by these six crude drugs, the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and the activity of caspase-3 were measured. Reduced mitochondrial transmembrane potentials within 12 hours after the administration of Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Cynomorium songaricum, Phellodendron amurense and Paeonia lactiflora, and within 24 hours after the administration of Eucommia ulmoides and Cinnamomum cassia were observed. All of the six apoptosis-inducing crude drugs increased caspase-3 activity within 12-36 hours after administration. After further examining the apoptosis-inducing activity of berberine, palmatine, panelofuroline and glycyrrhizin, which were the ingredients obtained from Phellodendron amurense, Glycyrrhiza uralensis and Paeonia lactiflora, it was found that only berberine could induce apoptosis. From these results, it was concluded that the apoptosis induced by the six crude drugs (Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Cynomorium songaricum, Eucommia ulmoides, Phellodendron amurense, Cinnamomum cassia and Paeonia lactiflora) occurred via the mitochondrial route and that the apoptosis-conducting mechanism acted through a cascade involving caspase-3.	berberine Apoptosis
2	Meta-analysis of the effect of herbal supplement on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: A variety of herbs has been used in traditional medicine for the treatment of diabetes. However, evidence is limited regarding the efficacy of individual herbs for glycemic control. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of herbal supplement on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Randomized controlled trials were identified through electronic searches (MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) up until February 2011, historical searches of relevant articles and personal contact with experts in the area. Studies were included in the meta-analysis if they were (1) randomized placebo-controlled trial of single herb aimed at assessing glycemic control in type 2 diabetes, (2) of at least 8 weeks duration, and (3) reporting HbA(1c). Treatment effect was estimated with mean difference in the final value of HbA(1c) and FBG between the treatment and the placebo groups. RESULTS: Nine randomized, placebo-controlled trials (n = 487 patients) were identified. Ipomoea batatas, Silybum marianum and Trigonella foenum-graecum significantly improved glycemic control, whereas Cinnamomum cassia did not. The pooled mean differences in HbA(1c) were -0.30% (95% CI -0.04% to -0.57%; P = 0.02), -1.92% (95% CI -0.51% to -3.32%; P = 0.008), and -1.13% (95% CI -0.11% to -2.14%; P = 0.03), respectively, for Ipomoea batatas, Silybum marianum, and Trigonella foenum-graecum. The corresponding values for FBG were -10.20mg/dL (95% CI -5.32 mg/dL to -15.08 mg/dL; P&lt;0.0001) and -38.05 mg/dL (95% CI -9.54 mg/dL to -66.57 mg/dL; P = 0.009), respectively, for Ipomoea batatas and Silybum marianum. CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence suggests that supplementation with Ipomoea batatas, Silybum marianum, and Trigonella foenum-graecum may improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. Such effect was not observed with Cinnamomum cassia. Given the limitations of the available studies and high heterogeneity of the study results for milk thistle and fenugreek, further high quality, large controlled trials using standardized preparation are warranted to better elucidate the effects of these herbs on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes patients.	fenugreek diabetes
2	[Particularities of corrective action of polar lipids and bioantioxidants from sea hydrobionts at imbalances of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism].A total mixture of phospho- and glycolipids from sea macrophytes Sargassum pallidum, Ulva fenestrata, Zostera marina was separated and the fatty acid composition was determined. Biological activity of the mixtures of polar lipids and natural antioxidants echinochrome A from flat sea urchin Scaphechinus mirabilis and polyphenolic complex from sea grass Zostera marina was studied in rats with experimental model of atherosclerosis and diabetes. These experiments revealed optimal compositions for mixtures of polar lipids and antioxidants, which possess high medical-corrective activity. Proposed mechanisms of action of the polar lipids (containing different polyunsaturated fatty acids) and antioxidants studied are presented. These compositions may be used for creation of new biologically-active additives and drugs.	zostera marina atherosclerosis
3	Radiosensitizing effect of schinifoline from Zanthoxylum schinifolium Sieb et Zucc on human non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells: a preliminary in vitro investigation.Schinifoline (SF), a 4-quinolinone derivative, was found in Zanthoxylum schinifolium for the first time. 4-Quinolinone moieties are thought to have cytotoxic activity and are often used as a tubulin polymerization inhibitors, heterogeneous enzyme inhibitors and antiplatelet agents. However, very little information respect to radiosensitization has focused on SF. This work aimed to investigate the radiosensitizing effect of SF on A549 cells. The cell viability results indicated cytotoxicity of SF on A549 cells, with IC50 values of 33.7 +- 2.4, 21.9 +- 1.9 and 16.8 +- 2.2 mug/mL, respectively, after 6, 12, 24 h treatment with different concentrations, and the 10% or 20% IC50 concentration during 12 h was applied in later experiments. The results of cell proliferative inhibition and clonogenic assay showed that SF enhanced the radiosensitivity of A549 cells when applied before 60Co gamma-irradiation and this effect was mainly time and concentration dependent. The flow cytometric data indicated that SF treatment before the irradiation increased the G2/M phase, thus improving the radiosensitivity of A549, leading to cell apoptosis. This paper is the first study that describes the in vitro radiosensitising, cell cycle and apoptotic-inducing effects of schinifoline. 	schinifoline cancer
3	Efficacy of a polyphenolic extract from silver fir (Abies alba) bark on psoriasis: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.Silver fir (Abies alba) bark extract contains a mixture of bioactive polyphenols. We tested their effectiveness in the treatment of psoriasis in order to further investigate the potential topical anti-inflammatory activity of polyphenols by means of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled add-on clinical trial, after having examined their ability to downregulate the expression of IL-1beta cytokine in monocyte/macrophage primary cell culture. 61 patients with mild psoriasis met the inclusion criteria and were willing to comply with protocol requirements, were enrolled in the study. The severity of the disease was measured by psoriasis area severity index (PASI). Treatment efficacy was evaluated by assessing erythema (E, 0 to 4-point scale), desquamation (D, 0 to 4-point scale) and induration (I, 0 to 4-point scale) of lesions before and after the treatment. All patients enrolled in the study had symmetrical psoriasis plaques on the skin. All patients received O/V ointment with 2% of silver fir bark extract and/or placebo, respectively. We compared medications by right/left intra-patient comparison, so that the control group was always contralateral of the tested one. Location of the tested or control site was randomised, using a computer-generated randomisation schedule. Silver fir extract was well-tolerated. A superiority of active treatment above placebo, based on the clinical investigational PASI score system was observed by 15 % in all volunteers and in 40% regarding the improvement of psoriasis on elbows. However, statistical analysis showed no significant differences between placebo and active treatment with the extract from silver fir bark (p &lt; 0.05).	polyphenols psoriasis

However, the molecular mechanism is unclear. In this study, we aim to investigate its anti-inflammatory effects against Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using activated macrophages (Raw246.7) in vitro and adjuvant arthritis rats (AA) in vivo. The results demonstrated that CA significantly reduced synovial inflammation in AA rats, possibly due to suppression of the expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially the IL-1beta. Further investigation found that CA also suppressed the activity of HIF-1alpha by inhibiting the accumulation of succinate in cytoplasm. As we know, the reduction of HIF-1alpha nucleation slows down IL-1beta production, because HIF-1alpha activates the expression of NLRP3, which is involved in the assembly of inflammasome and processing of IL-1beta. In addition, CA also inhibited the expression of the succinate receptor GPR91, which in turn inhibited the activation of HIF-1alpha. In conclusions, our results suggested that CA might be a potential therapeutic compound to relieve rheumatoid arthritis progress by suppressing IL-1beta through modulating succinate/HIF-1alpha axis and inhibition of NLRP3.

1	Characterization of isobutylhydroxyamides with NGF-potentiating activity from Zanthoxylum bungeanum.Eight isobutylhydroxyamides, including three new (1-3), qinbunamides A-C, and five known sanshools (4-8), ZP-amide A (4), ZP-amide B (5), ZP-amide E (6), ZP-amide C (7), and ZP-amide D (8), were isolated from the pericarps of cultivated Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim, cultivated in Qinling mountain area, Shaanxi, China. The structures of all compounds were determined on the basis of spectroscopic techniques, including 1D and 2D NMR analysis and comparison with previously reported data. Compounds 1 and 2 are the first example of isobutylhydroxyamides containing an ethoxy group, and compound 3 is a rare C11 fatty acid-containing sanshool existing in genus Zanthoxylum. The tested compounds enhanced nerve growth factor (NGF)-mediated neurite outgrowth (neurotrophic activity) in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells, but were inactive in the inhibitory effects on the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical and growth of HCT116 cells at concentrations of 50muM.

1	Insecticidal and fumigant activities of Cinnamomum cassia bark-derived materials against Mechoris ursulus (Coleoptera: attelabidae).The insecticidal and fumigant activities of Cinnamomum cassia (Blume) bark-derived materials against the oak nut weevil (Mechoris ursulus Roelofs) were examined using filter paper diffusion and fumigation methods and compared to those of the commercially available Cinnamomum bark-derived compounds (eugenol, salicylaldehyde, trans-cinnamic acid, and cinnamyl alcohol). The biologically active constituent of the Cinnamomum bark was characterized as trans-cinnamaldehyde by spectroscopic analysis. In a test with the filter paper diffusion method, trans-cinnamaldehyde showed 100 and 83.3% mortality at rates of 2.5 and 1.0 mg/filter paper, respectively. At 2.5 mg/paper, strong insecticidal activity was produced from eugenol (90.0% mortality) and salicylaldehyde (88. 9%), whereas trans-cinnamic acid revealed moderate activity (73.3%). At 5 mg/paper, weak insecticidal activity (50.0%) was produced from cinnamyl alcohol. In a fumigation test, the Cinnamomum bark-derived compounds were much more effective against M. ursulus larvae in closed cups than in open ones. These results indicate that the insecticidal activity of test compounds was attributable to fumigant action, although there is also significant contact toxicity. As a naturally occurring insect-control agent, the Cinnamomum bark-derived materials described could be useful as a new preventive agent against damage caused by M. ursulus.

1	Phenolic compounds of Abies nephrolepis and their NO production inhibitory activities.Two new, i.e., 1 and 2, and 69 known phenolics were isolated from the aerial parts of Abies nephrolepis. These chemical constituents included 22 lignans, 30 flavonoids, and 19 other phenols. Their structures were determined mainly by analysis of the 1D- and 2D-NMR spectroscopic data. All the 71 isolates were evaluated for their inhibitory activities against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NO production in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Compound 1 exhibited a potent effect with an IC(50) value of 13.7 mug/ml.	abies nephrolepis lipopolysaccharide
2	Clinical effects of Zingiber cassumunar (Plai): A systematic review.Zingiber cassumunar Roxb. known locally as "Plai" in Thai, has been used for treating bruise, sprain and musculoskeletal pain. Several pre-clinical studies demonstrated the anti-inflammatory effect of Plai. However, current evidence of clinical effects of Plai is still unclear. This study aimed to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of Plai among all identified indications. Of the 808 articles identified by a systematic review, six studies were included. Four studies were randomized controlled trials, while two studies were quasi-experimental studies involving 178 patients in intervention group and 177 patients in control group. Duration of treatment ranged from 7days to 2 months. Our findings showed that 14% Plai cream had a strong trend of benefits in pain reduction for muscle pain and ankle sprain. However, evidence supporting the effects of Plai on acne vulgaris treatment and anti-histamine effect are still unclear.	zingiber cassumunar roxb bruise
2	Ethnopharmacological survey of Annonaceae medicinal plants used to treat malaria in four areas of Cameroon.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Malaria endemic countries have vital resources that are medicinal plants on which their traditional medicines depend. In some Cameroonian settings, in addition to the commonly used potions from plants like Alstonia boonei, Zanthoxylum macrophylla and Mangifera indica, other herbal species are being increasingly used to treat malaria. So, specialized traditional healers have developed alternative reasonably priced therapies, relying on the signs and/or symptoms of malaria. Within this framework, Annonaceae plants were found to be increasingly utilized and therefore, highlighting the need to document this traditional knowledge for better malaria control. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Interview approach was used to document indigenous knowledge, usage customs and practices of Annonaceae species in the treatment of malaria in four Cameroonian areas (Yaounde and its surroundings, Ngoyang, Kon-Yambetta and Mbalmayo). RESULTS: A total of 19/30 users of plants accepted to share their experiences during a semi-structured survey. Twelve of the respondents were men and seven were women. Thirty recipes based on twenty-one plants were recorded. CONCLUSION: Annickia chlorantha was the only plant commonly found in the four study sites. Seven species of Annonaceae were found to be used to treat malaria, while 14 were used to treat symptoms that might be related to malaria.	annickia chlorantha malaria
1	Metabolic profiles of the Flos Abelmoschus manihot extract by intestinal bacteria from the normal and CKD model rats based on UPLC-Q-TOF/MS.Flos Abelmoschus manihot is a traditional herbal medicine widely used in clinical practice to tackle chronic kidney disease (CKD) for thousands of years. Nowadays, many studies indicate that gut bacteria are closely related to the progression of CKD and CKD-related complications. In this study, a UPLC-Q-TOF/MS method coupled with the MetaboLynx  software was established and successfully applied to investigate the metabolites and metabolic profile of Flos A. manihot extract by intestinal bacteria from normal and CKD rats. Eight parent components and eight metabolites were characterized by their protonated ions. Among these compounds, 15 were detected in the two group samples while M16 was only determined in the CKD model samples. Compared with the quercetin-type glycosides, fewer myricetin-type and gossypetin-type metabolites were obtained in the two group samples. These metabolites suggested that deglycosylation and methylation are the major metabolic pathways of Flos A. manihot extract. Few differences of metabolite classes were observed in the two group samples. However, the concentrations of aglycones such as quercetin, myricetin and gossypetin in the normal samples were notably higher than those in the CKD model samples. The results are important in unravelling the pharmacological effects of A. manihot and clarifying its mechanism of action in vivo.	a. manihot quercetin
1	[Analysis and utilization value discussion of multiple chemical composition in different tissues of Abelmoschus manihot].This research is to analyze the resourceful chemical composition in different tissues (root, stem, leaf and flower) of Abelmoschus manihot and evaluate their utilizing value. The flavonoids, soluble polysaccharides, cellulose, nucleosides and amino acids in the different tissues of A. manihot were determined by HPLC coupled with UV-Vis spectrophotpmetry, and UPLC-TQ/MS. The flowers are rich in the resourceful chemical compositions of flavonoids which mainly consist of hyperoside, isoquercitrin, cotton-8-O-glucuronide, myricetin, quercetin-3'-O-glucoside, rutin and quercetin. The total content of these flavonoids is 25.450 mg g-1 in the flowers, while they are trace in the other tissues.Different tissues of A. manihot are rich in soluble polysaccharides and celluloses and the stems have the highest content(19.76%) of soluble polysaccharides, while the roots have the highest content (29.88%) of cellulose. Total of 21 amino acids and 9 nucleosides were detected in this plant, and the flowers have the highest content of amino acids(4.737 mg g-1), while the leaves have the highest content of nucleosides (1.474 mg g-1). A. manihot is rich in the resourceful chemical compositions, and its constituents and contents are various in different tissues of this plant.The results provided a scientific basis for the utilization and industrial development of A. manihot plants.	a. manihot nucleosides
1	In vitro inhibition of dengue virus entry by p-sulfoxy-cinnamic acid and structurally related combinatorial chemistries.The anti-adhesive compound p-sulfoxy-cinnamic acid, zosteric acid (ZA), is derived from the temperate marine eelgrass, Zostera marina. ZA and five combinatorial chemistries based on ZA were evaluated for their anti-viral properties against dengue virus in a focus forming unit reduction assay. None of the compounds showed evidence of toxicity to the monkey kidney cell line LLCMK-2 over the concentration ranges tested. ZA showed a modest IC(50) of approximately 2.3 mM against DENV-2. Three other compounds showed IC(50) values of 2.5, 2.4, 0.3 mM, with a fourth not achieving a 50% inhibitory concentration against DENV-2. The most active compound, CF 238, showed IC(50) values of 24, 46, 14 and 47 microM against DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4, respectively. CF 238 showed evidence of inhibition at an entry step in the viral life cycle and enhanced virus:cell binding as evidenced by a quantitative RT-PCR assay system. CF 238 may promote inappropriate virus:cell attachments common to all DENV strains that interfere with receptor interactions required for viral entry. These and other related chemistries may be useful as reagents for studying DENV entry, capturing and detecting DENV, and development of pharmaceuticals.	zostera marina p-sulfoxy-cinnamic acid
2	In vitro anti-Helicobacter pylori action of 30 Chinese herbal medicines used to treat ulcer diseases.Infection by Helicobacter pylori has been ascertained to be an important etiologic impetus leading usually to chronic active gastritis and gastric ulcer with growing incidences worldwide. Utilizing as the test pathogen a standard and five clinic strains of Helicobacter pylori, the antibacterial action was assessed in vitro with ethanol extracts of 30 Chinese herbal medicines which have been frequently prescribed since ancient times for treating gastritis-like disorders. Among the 30 tested materials, the ethanol extracts of Abrus cantoniensis (Fabaceae), Saussurea lappa (Asteraceae) and Eugenia caryophyllata (Myrtaceae) were strongly inhibitory to all test strains (MICs: approximately 40 microg/ml), and Hippophae rhamnoides (Elaeagnaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii (Liliaceae), Magnolia officinalis and Schisandra chinensis (Magnoliaceae), Corydalis yanhusuo (Papaveraceae), Citrus reticulata (Rutaceae), Bupleurum chinense and Ligusticum chuanxiong (Apiaceae) substantially active with MICs close to 60.0 microg/ml. As to antibacterial actions of the aqueous extracts of the same drugs, those derived from Cassia obtusifolia (Fabaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii and Eugenia caryophyllata were remarkably inhibitory against all the six Helicobacter pylori strains (MICs: approximately 60 microg/ml). The work compared almost quantitatively the magnitude of the anti-Helicobacter pylori actions of the 30 most prescribed gastritis-treating Chinese herbal drugs, and located as well some source plants where potent anti-Helicobacter pylori phytochemicals could be characterized.	corydalis yanhusuo gastritis
1	Downregulation of the basic peroxidase isoenzyme from Zinnia elegans by gibberellic acid.Hypocotyl formation during the epigeal germination of seedlings is under strict hormonal regulation. In a 3 d old Zinnia elegans seedling system, gibberellic acid (GA(3)) exerts an opposite effect to that exerted by light on hypocotyl photomorphogenesis because GA(3) promotes an etiolated-like growth with an inhibition of radial (secondary) growth. For this reason, the effect of GA(3) on the basic peroxidase isoenzyme from Z. elegans (ZePrx), an enzyme involved in hypocotyl lignin biosynthesis, was studied. The results showed that GA(3) reduces ZePrx activity, similarly to the way in which it reduces seedling secondary growth. This hormonal response is supported by the analysis of the ZePrx promoter, which contains four types of GA(3)-responsive cis-elements: the W Box/O2S; the Pyr Box; the GARE; and the Amy Box. Taken together, these results suggest that ZePrx is directly regulated by GA(3), with this effect matching the inhibitory effect of GA on the hypocotyl secondary growth.	z. elegans lignin
1	Foliar and cortex oleoresin variability of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) in Albania.Terpene composition of needle and cortical oleoresin from lateral shoots were analyzed by GC/MS for four Silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) populations scattered in natural species range in Albania. More than sixty compounds were detected in the needle oleoresin, which was characterized by a high content of alpha-pinene, camphene, beta-pinene, limonene and bornyl acetate. Three monoterpenes, alpha-pinene, beta-pinene and limonene, and two sesquiterpenes, beta-caryophyllene and germacrene D, comprised the majority of cortical oleoresin. The terpene composition differences among the populations that led to the recognition of two chemotypes. The needle oleoresin from the provinces of Puka, Bulqiza and Llogara were characterised by high amounts of beta-pinene, camphene and alpha-pinene and low amounts of limonene, while that from Drenova had high amounts of beta-pinene and limonene. A similar pattern was found in the cortical oleoresin with the exception of camphene that was a minor contributor. Geographical and seasonal variation between the populations was, also, investigated. Multivariate analysis of both needle and cortical oleoresin separated Drenova (southeastern population) from the other sites. When both major monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes were considered four chemical profiles could be attributed. Based on their chemical profiles, the populations can be divided into two groups: Populations with high content of beta-pinene and alpha-pinene but a low content of limonene (Puka, Bulqiza and Llogara), typical of most of A. alba populations in all its distribution range. Population with a high content of limonene and a moderate content of beta-pinene and alpha-pinene (Drenova).	a. alba beta-caryophyllene
1	The Use of Essential Oils and Their Isolated Compounds for the Treatment of Oral Candidiasis: A Literature Review.In this literature review, we present the main scientific findings on the antifungal activity of essential oils (EOs) applicable for a new drug formulation to treat oral candidiasis. Seven literature databases were systematically searched for eligible in vitro and clinical trials. Selected articles were screened for biological activity, botanical species, phytochemical composition, study design, and methodological quality. A total of 26 articles were included in the review, of which 21 were in vitro studies and 5 clinical trials. The most promising EOs were obtained from Allium tubeorosum, Cinnamomum cassia, Cinnamomum zeylanicum, and Coriandrum sativum L. Among the phytochemicals, citral and thymol were the most active. Clinical trials indicated that the EOs from Pelargonium graveolens and Zataria multiflora are potentially effective to treat oral candidiasis. Further nonclinical and clinical studies with these EO are warranted to determine their potential use and safety for the treatment of oral candidiasis.	coriandrum sativum l EOs
2	Profiling of the compounds absorbed in human plasma and urine after oral administration of a traditional Japanese (kampo) medicine, daikenchuto.Daikenchuto (DKT), a pharmaceutical-grade traditional Japanese (Kampo) medicine, has been widely used for the treatment of various gastrointestinal disorders including postoperative ileus and has been integrated into the modern medical care system in Japan as a prescription drug. DKT is a multiherbal medicine consisting of Japanese pepper (zanthoxylum fruit), processed ginger, and ginseng with maltose as an additive. Despite substantial research on the pharmacological activities of DKT and its ingredients, the lack of studies on absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of DKT has made it difficult to obtain a consistent picture of its mechanism of action. In the present study, we constructed an analysis procedure consisting of seven conditions of liquid chromatography and mass spectrometric analysis, which enabled the identification of 44 ingredients of DKT component herbs. We investigated the plasma and urine profiles of these ingredients 0.5 to 8 h after oral administration of 15.0 g of DKT in four healthy volunteers. The results indicated that 1) hydroxy-alpha-sanshool and [6]-shogaol, the prominent peaks in plasma derived from Japanese pepper and ginger, respectively, were detected at 0.5 h and thereafter decreased throughout the sampling period; 2) ginsenoside Rb(1), a prominent peak derived from ginseng, increased gradually during the sampling period; 3) glucuronide conjugates of hydroxy-sanshools, shogaols, and gingerols were detected in plasma and urine; and 4) no obvious differences between samples from the two male and the two female individuals were observed. These results provide a strong basis for future studies on pharmacokinetics and pharmacology of DKT.	ginger gastrointestinal disorders
1	Green and Efficient Processing of Cinnamomum cassia Bark by Using Ionic Liquids: Extraction of Essential Oil and Construction of UV-Resistant Composite Films from Residual Biomass.There is significant interest in the development of a sustainable and integrated process for the extraction of essential oils and separation of biopolymers by using novel and efficient solvent systems. Herein, cassia essential oil enriched in coumarin is extracted from Cinnamomum cassia bark by using a protic ionic liquid (IL), ethylammonium nitrate (EAN), through dissolution and the creation of a biphasic system with the help of diethyl ether. The process has been perfected, in terms of higher biomass dissolution ability and essential oil yield through the addition of aprotic ILs (based on the 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium (C4 mim) cation and chloride or acetate anions) to EAN. After extraction of oil, cellulose-rich material and free lignin were regenerated from biomass-IL solutions by using a 1:1 mixture of acetone-water. The purity of the extracted essential oil and biopolymers were ascertained by means of FTIR spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, and GC-MS techniques. Because lignin contains UV-blocking chromophores, the oil-free residual lignocellulosic material has been directly utilized to construct UV-light-resistant composite materials in conjunction with the biopolymer chitosan. Composite material thus obtained was processed to form biodegradable films, which were characterized for mechanical and optical properties. The films showed excellent UV-light resistance and mechanical properties, thereby making it a material suitable for packaging and light-sensitive applications.	cinnamomum cassia lignin
1	A new cytotoxic coumarin, 7-[(E)-3',7'-dimethyl-6'-oxo-2',7'-octadienyl] oxy coumarin, from the leaves of Zanthoxylum schinifolium.A new coumarin, 7-[(E)-3',7'-dimethyl-6'-oxo-2',7'-octadienyl]oxy coumarin (1), together with three known compounds, schinilenol (2), schinindiol (3) and 7-[(E)-7'-hydroxy-3',7'-dimethylocta-2',5'-dienyloxy]-coumarin (4) were isolated from the methylene chloride fraction of Z. schinifolium by normal and reverse phase column chromatographies. Their structures were determined on the basis of physical and spectroscopic evidences. Compound 1 (IC(50) 8.10 muM) showed potent cytotoxicity compared to auraptene (IC(50) 55.36 muM) against Jurkat T cells. The other isolated compounds 2 and 4 exhibited weak cytotoxicities.	z. schinifolium 7-[(e)-3',7'-dimethyl-6'-oxo-2',7'-octadienyl] oxy coumarin
1	Cinnamaldehyde induces cell apoptosis mediated by a novel circular RNA hsa_circ_0043256 in non-small cell lung cancer.Cinnamaldehyde (CA), the primary chemical component of the Chinese traditional herb Cinnamomum cassia, is an effective cytotoxic agent against various human cancers. Our previous study indicated that CA could trigger apoptosis in three kinds of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. However, CA mechanism of action in NSCLC has not been unveiled completely. Herein, we showed that a novel circular RNA hsa_circ_0043256 was upregulated in NSCLC cells in response to CA treatment, as detected by microarray and real-time PCR. Hsa_circ_0043256 could inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis, while hsa_circ_0043256 knock-down could promote cell proliferation and restrain apoptosis induced by CA. Bioinformatics analysis predicted that hsa_circ_0043256 could work as a miR-1252 sponge, which could in turn directly target a vital negative regulator of Canonical Wnt signaling, Itchy E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (ITCH), as validated by dual-luciferase assay. Western blot results further confirmed that hsa_circ_0043256 could upregulate ITCH expression, whereas miR-1252 could partially abolish this effect. Interestingly, hsa_circ_0043256 knock-down could weaken Wnt/beta-catenin pathway inhibition induced by CA. Finally, we discovered that CA induced apoptosis and meanwhile upregulated hsa_circ_0043256 expression in vivo. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that ITCH expression was positively association with hsa_circ_0043256 levels.

1	Cinnamomum cassia extract promotes thermogenesis during exposure to cold via activation of brown adipose tissue.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Cinnamomum cassia (L.) J.Presl (Lauraceae), a widely used traditional Chinese medicine, is well known to exert hot property. It is recorded as dispelling cold drug in ancient Chinese monographs, such as Synopsis of golden chamber published in Han dynasty. According to Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2015), Cinnamomum cassia (L.) J.Presl (Cinnamon) has the functions of dispersing cold, relieving pain, warming meridians and promoting blood circulation. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of Cinnamon extract (CE) on cold endurance and the mechanism of thermogenesis activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The improving effect of hypothermia were evaluated with body temperature by infrared camera and multi-thermo thermometer. In vivo, the thermogenic effect was observed with energy metabolism and substrate utilization. The activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) was evaluated with the histomorphology and expression of thermogenic protein. In vitro, the uncoupling effects on mitochondrial was evaluated with Seahorse and fluorescent staining. The mechanism of thermogenesis was explored in brown adipocyte. RESULTS: The body temperature and energy expenditure were significantly increased by CE administration in cold environment. In morphology, lipid droplets were reduced and the number of mitochondrial was increased. CE significantly increased the non-shivering thermogenesis via upregulating the expression of thermogenic protein. In vitro, the uncoupling effect was obviously along with the decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production. It was confirmed that the thermogenesis effect was induced via lipolysis and energy metabolism. In addition, CE also alleviated myocardium injury in the morphology in cold environment. Moreover, the major constituent was identified as (1) coumarin, (2) cinnamic acid, (3) cinnamaldehyde and (4) 2-methoxy cinnamaldehyde. CONCLUSIONS: The mechanism of improving cold tolerance was related to lipolysis and activation of BAT. Meanwhile, we provided a kind of potential prevention methods for cold injury.	cinnamomum cassia 2-methoxy cinnamaldehyde
1	Antibacterial benzofuran neolignans and benzophenanthridine alkaloids from the roots of Zanthoxylum capense.Two new 2-arylbenzofuran neolignans and a new benzophenanthridine alkaloid, together with six known benzophenanthridine alkaloids, namely, decarine, norchelerythrine, dihydrochelerythrine, 6-acetonyldihydrochelerythrine, tridecanonchelerythrine, and 6-acetonyldihydronitidine, have been isolated from the MeOH extract of the roots of Zanthoxylum capense. Their structures were elucidated by means of spectroscopic techniques including 2D NMR experiments. All the isolated compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Some compounds showed significant inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 with MIC values ranging from 12.5 to 50 mug/mL.	zanthoxylum capense 6-acetonyldihydronitidine
2	Therapeutic potential of root and stem bark of wild medicinal plant Ziziphus mauritiana (Lamk.) against silica induced toxicity in Wistar albino rats.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ziziphus mauritiana (Lamk.) of the family Rhamnaceae is a traditional herbal medicinal plant commonly called as 'ber' (Indian jujube). It is traditionally used as food source and helps in treatment of various diseases like malaria, asthma, diarrhoea, typhoid, diabetes, skin diseases and acts as a pain killer. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to evaluate the ability of extracts of barks of root and stem of Ziziphus mauritiana (ZM) to cure silica induced toxicity in Wistar albino rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experiments carried out on the acute toxicity studies of silica and therapeutic potential of ZM extracts were based on OECD guidelines and from these results lethal dose (LD50) values were determined. Silica was administered by IP injection at 20 mg/kg b.w. for 10 days and roots and stem barks extracts of ZM were fed orally by gavage at 400 mg/kg b.w. for 21 days. Assessments of biochemical, haematological parameters as well as liver histological examination were performed in the study. RESULTS: After 21 days of oral feeding of extracts of root and stem of ZM, it was found to alter the liver histology. Significant decrease in enzymes such as ALT, AST, ALP, LDH and urea, creatinine and uric acid levels in serum were recorded. Treatment with extracts could help enzymatic activity of liver antioxidant enzymes to settle towards normal level and significant decrease in the lipid peroxidation along with increase in the value of GSH in liver, was also observed. In addition, extracts of ZM also helped to reduce the serum NO, IL-6 and TNF-alpha level. CONCLUSION: Results of this study has suggested that the extracts of root and stem bark of ZM can be used for therapeutic purpose to prevent silica induced toxicity. ZM extracts could be utilised as natural antioxidant and immunotherapeutic medicines to protect silica induced cell damage.	jujube diarrhoea
1	[Analysis and utilization value discussion of multiple chemical composition in different tissues of Abelmoschus manihot].This research is to analyze the resourceful chemical composition in different tissues (root, stem, leaf and flower) of Abelmoschus manihot and evaluate their utilizing value. The flavonoids, soluble polysaccharides, cellulose, nucleosides and amino acids in the different tissues of A. manihot were determined by HPLC coupled with UV-Vis spectrophotpmetry, and UPLC-TQ/MS. The flowers are rich in the resourceful chemical compositions of flavonoids which mainly consist of hyperoside, isoquercitrin, cotton-8-O-glucuronide, myricetin, quercetin-3'-O-glucoside, rutin and quercetin. The total content of these flavonoids is 25.450 mg g-1 in the flowers, while they are trace in the other tissues.Different tissues of A. manihot are rich in soluble polysaccharides and celluloses and the stems have the highest content(19.76%) of soluble polysaccharides, while the roots have the highest content (29.88%) of cellulose. Total of 21 amino acids and 9 nucleosides were detected in this plant, and the flowers have the highest content of amino acids(4.737 mg g-1), while the leaves have the highest content of nucleosides (1.474 mg g-1).

1	Microwave-assisted extraction of jujube polysaccharide: Optimization, purification and functional characterization.The operational parameters involved in microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) of jujube polysaccharide including microwave power, water to raw material ratio and extraction temperature and time were optimized by RSM. MAE at 400W, 75 C, 60 min, using 30 g water/g powdered jujube was the best condition for maximum yield (9.02%) of polysaccharide. Two novel water-soluble polysaccharides (JCP-1 and JCP-2) with average molecular weights of 9.1x10(4)-1.5x10(5)Da in term of the symmetrical narrow peaks were identified using the analytical purification procedures. The JCP-1 and JCP-2 mainly composed of glucose, arabinose, galactose and rhamnose in molar ratios of 1.4:2.1:4.2:0.9 and 1.2:1.8:4.1:1.1, respectively. The use of 1.5% JCP-1 led to a high emulsifying stability (95.5%) in a model oil-in-water type emulsion with a reduced surface tension (44.1 mN/m) and droplet size (1.32 mum), and an increased apparent viscosity (0.13 Pas) during 21-day cold storage. The antioxidant activities were increased in dose-dependent manners (25-200 mug/mL).	jujube rhamnose

1	Fumigant toxicity of cassia and cinnamon oils and cinnamaldehyde and structurally related compounds to Dermanyssus gallinae (Acari: Dermanyssidae).The toxicity of two cassia oils, four cinnamon oils and (E)-cinnamaldehyde and (E)-cinnamic acid and 34 structurally related compounds to adult Dermanyssus gallinae (De Geer) collected from a poultry house was examined using a vapour-phase mortality bioassay. Results were compared with those of dichlorvos, a conventional acaricide. The cassia and cinnamon oils (cinnamon technical, cinnamon #500, cassia especial, cassia true, cinnamon bark and cinnamon green leaf) exhibited good fumigant toxicity (LD(50), 11.79-26.40 mug cm(-3)). alpha-Methyl-(E)-cinnamaldehyde (LD(50), 0.45 mug cm(-3)) and (E)-cinnamaldehyde (0.54 mug cm(-3)) were the most toxic compounds and the toxicity of these compounds was comparable to that of dichlorvos (0.30 mug cm(-3)). Potent fumigant toxicity was also observed in allyl cinnamate, ethyl-alpha-cyanocinnamate, (E)-2-methoxylcinnamic acid and (Z)-2-methoxylcinnamic acid (LD(50), 0.81-0.92 mug cm(-3)). Structure-activity relationships indicate that structural characteristics, such as types of functional groups and carbon skeleton rather than vapour pressure parameter, appear to play a role in determining toxicity. The essential oils and compounds described merit further study as potential acaricides for the control of D. gallinae populations as fumigants with contact action due to global efforts to reduce the level of highly toxic synthetic acaricides in the agricultural environment.	cinnamon (e)-cinnamic acid
2	The efficacy of Plygersic gel for use in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee.OBJECTIVE: An evaluation of the efficacy of the combination of ginger (Zingiber officinale) and plai (Zingiber cassumunar) gel for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee using 1% diclofenac gel as a comparator. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A double-blind, randomized, controlled trial of the combination of 4% ginger and plai extract in a gel (Plygersic gel) as compared with a 1% solution of diclofenac in patients with osteoarthritis knees. The number of participants in each group totaled fifty. The length of treatment was a 6 week period. The efficacy of the drugs was monitored by using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). The t-test was used to compare the scores before and after treatments in each group. The repeated ANOVA was used to compare the scores between the two groups. RESULTS: Both Plygersic gel and diclofenac gel could significantly improve knee joint pain, symptoms, daily activities, sports activities and quality of life measured by KOOS following 6 weeks of treatment. In the repeated ANOVA, there were no differences in the results between the Plygersic and diclofenac gel groups. CONCLUSION: Plygersic gel relieves joint pain and improves problematic symptoms and improves the quality of life in osteoarthritis knees during a 6 week treatment regimen with no differences to the 1% Diclofenac gel group.	zingiber cassumunar osteoarthritis
1	Improvement of insulin sensitivity in obese Zucker rats by myricetin extracted from Abelmoschus moschatus.In an attempt to develop new substances for treating insulin resistance, obese Zucker rats were employed to screen the effect of myricetin, an active principle of Abelmoschus moschatus (Malvaceae), on insulin resistance. Myricetin purified from the aerial portion of the plant was administered intravenously ( I. V.) into animals. A dose-dependent decrease in the plasma glucose concentration of obese Zucker rats was observed 30 min following an I. V. injection. Moreover, repeated I. V. injection of myricetin (1 mg/kg) into obese Zucker rats 3 times daily for 1 week reduced the value of the glucose-insulin index, an index of insulin resistance calculated from the areas under the curve of glucose and insulin during the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test. Additionally, repeated myricetin treatments overturned the inability of insulin to increase the expression of glucose transporter subtype 4 (GLUT 4) and to increase the protein levels and phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) in soleus muscle of these obese rats. The inability of insulin to increase expression of the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) and to promote Akt serine phosphorylation in soleus muscle of these rats were also overturned by repeated myricetin treatments. These findings indicate that myricetin improves insulin sensitivity through increased post-receptor insulin signaling mediated by enhancements in IRS-1-associated PI3-kinase and GLUT 4 activity in muscles of obese Zucker rats. Myricetin might be used as a model substance for the development of antidiabetic compounds.	abelmoschus moschatus Myricetin
1	Aroma constituents and alkylamides of red and green huajiao (Zanthoxylum bungeanum and Zanthoxylum schinifolium).Huajiao denotes the fruits of various species of Zanthoxylum in the plant family Rutaceare used for cooking. The two most commercially popular species are bungeanum (red huajiao) and schinifolium (green huajiao). Fresh huajiao has a very high content of essential oil, up to 11%, which is described as having fresh, spicy, floral, cooling, and green aroma notes. A comprehensive analysis of the essential oils by GC-MS using advanced peak deconvolution and data processing software, revealed many overlapping components. A total of 120 aroma compounds for each species has been found. In the essential oils, linalyl acetate (15%), linalool (13%), and limonene (12%) are the major components of red huajiao, whereas linalool (29%), limonene (14%), and sabinene (13%) are the major components of green huajiao. For estimation of the aroma contribution of individual components, a new concept, "aroma character impact value" (ACI), is introduced as the percentage of the ratio of the concentration of an aroma component to its odor threshold value. Despite the differences in major components, both species have six common compounds of top aroma character impact: linalool, alpha-terpineol, myrcene, 1,8-cineole, limonene, and geraniol. The tingling sensation of huajiao is caused mainly by the alkylamide hydroxy-alpha-sanshool. The tingling compound decomposes easily under hydrolytic conditions or under UV light.

1	Quantitative and pattern recognition analyses of magnoflorine, spinosin, 6'''-feruloyl spinosin and jujuboside A by HPLC in Zizyphi Semen.Two rapid and simple HPLC methods with UV detector to determine three main compounds (magnoflorine, spinosin and 6'''-feruloyl spinosin) and evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD) to determine jujuboside A were developed for the chemical analyses of Zizyphi Semen. Magnoflorine, spinosin, and 6'''-feruloyl spinosin were separated with an YMC J'sphere ODS-H80 column (250 mm x 4.6 mm, 4 mum) by the gradient elution followed by the isocratic elution using methanol with 0.1 % formic acid and water with 0.1 % formic acid as the mobile phase. The flow rate was 1.0 mL/min. Jujuboside A was separated by HPLC-ELSD with YoungJinBioChrom Aegispak C18-L column (250 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 mum) column in a gradient elution using methanol with 0.1 % formic acid (A) and water with 0.1 % formic acid as the mobile phase. These two methods were fully validated with respect to linearity, precision, accuracy, stability, and robustness. These HPLC methods were applied successfully to quantify four compounds in a Zizyphi Semen extract. The HPLC analytical methods were validated for pattern recognition analysis by repeated analysis of 91 seed samples corresponding to 48 Zizyphus jujuba var. spinosa (J01-J48) and 43 Zizyphus mauritiana (M01-M43). The results indicate that these methods are suitable for a quality evaluation of Zizyphi Semen.	zizyphus jujuba var magnoflorine
2	[Study on the Chinese herbal formula for treatment of vaginitis and the antimicrobial activity in murine models].OBJECTIVE: To study on the various proportions of Radix Sophorae Flavescentis, Cortex Phellodendri, Fructus Cnidii and pericarp of Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim in the formulas, whose antimicrobial effects on E. coli, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and C. albicans under different pH values were compared in vitro. METHODS: According to Chinese ancient proved recipe, the K-B method and plate diluting method were adopted to measure antimicrobial activity, and orthogonal design to ascertain the herbal formula in vitro. Finally, murine models were established to test the antimicrobial activity in vivo through vaginal membrane irritancy experiment, negative rate of pathogeny and pathological grade of vaginal membrane. RESULTS: The results suggested that formulas with different proportions of the herbs had diverse antimicrobial activities, and the effect was shown to be most obvious when one milliliter drug contains 100 microl Fructus Cnidii-pericarp of Zanthoxylum bungeanum (2:1) co-extracted volatile oil and 50 microl Radix Sophorae Flavescentis and Cortex Phenodendri ethanol extraction respectively under pH6. The antimicrobial effect of the formula, which hardly had any membrane irritancy, was better than Jie Eryin in vitro and vivo. CONCLUSION: The fromula has few components and better effect, and adaptation to the pH value of vaginitis. It is a promising alternative for gynecological diseases.	zanthoxylum bungeanum irritancy
3	Cinnamaldehyde inhibits lymphocyte proliferation and modulates T-cell differentiation.Two kinds of cinnamaldehyde derivative, 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (HCA) and 2'-benzoxy-cinnamaldehyde (BCA), were studied for their immunomodulatory effects. These compounds were screened as anticancer drug candidates from stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia for their inhibitory effect on farnesyl protein transferase activity. Ras activation, which is accompanied with its farnesylation, has been known to be important in immune cell activation as well as in carcinogenesis. Treatment of these cinnamaldehydes to mouse splenocyte cultures induced suppression of lymphoproliferation following both Con A and LPS stimulation in a dose-dependent manner. A dose of I microM of HCA and BCA inhibited the Con A-stimulated proliferation by 69% and 60%, and the LPS-induced proliferation by 29% and 21%, respectively. However, the proliferation induced by PMA plus ionomycin was affected by neither HCA nor BCA treatment. Decreased levels of antibody production by HCA or BCA treatment were observed in both SRBC-immunized mice and LPS-stimulated splenocyte cultures. The exposure of thymocytes to HCA or BCA for 48 h accelerated T-cell differentiation from CD4 and CD8 double positive cells to CD4 or CD8 single positive cells. The inhibitory effect of cinnamaldehyde on lymphoproliferation was specific to the early phase of cell activation, showing the strongest inhibition of Con A- or LPS-stimulated proliferation when added concomitantly with the mitogens. In addition, the treatment of HCA and BCA to splenocyte cultures attenuated the Con A-triggered progression of cell cycle at G1 phase with no inhibition of S to G2/M phase transition. Although cinnamaldehyde treatment had no effect on the IL-2 production by splenocyte cultures stimulated with Con A, it inhibited markedly and dose-dependently the expression of IL-2Ralpha and interferon-gamma. Taken together, the results in this study suggest both HCA and BCA inhibit the lymphoproliferation and induce a T-cell differentiation through the blockade of early steps in signaling pathway leading to cell growth.

1	The early stages of three Palaearctic species of saproxylic hoverflies (Syrphidae, Diptera).The third stage larva and puparium of the cerioidine hoverflies, Ceriana vespiformis (Latreille, 1804) and Sphiximorpha subsessilis (Illiger in Rossi, 1807) and the milesine, Spilomyia digitata (Rondani, 1865) (Diptera, Syrphidae) are described from specimens collected in the field. Ceriana vespiformis and S. digitata larvae were obtained from wet, decaying roots and tree holes of Fraxinus angustifolius L., respectively, in Spain and S. subsessilis from an exudation of sap on an Abies alba Miller tree in France.	abies alba cerioidine
2	[Analysis on volatile constituents of Semen Ziziphi Spinosae by HS-SPME-GC-MS].OBJECTIVE: To establish a rapid and simple method for the determination of volatile constituents in Semen Ziziphi Spinosae. METHODS: The volatile constituents in Semen Ziziphi Spinosae were extracted by head space solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and analysed by GC-MS. RESULTS: Powder of sample was pre-heated for 30 min at 90 degrees C, then headspace-extracted with 65 microm PDMS/DVB fiber for 50 min. After desorbed for 5 min at 250 degrees C, the separation was well completed on a Rxi -50 capillary column. 126 kinds of volatile compounds were isolated and 116 compounds were identified. The amounts of compound from the volatile constituents were determined by area normalization method. The main components extracted by HS-SPME were alkane (32.08%), terpenoid and derivatives of oxygenated terpenoid (27.06%). CONCLUSION: The method is simple, fast and accurate, and it is suitable for the determination of the volatile constituents in fruit of Ziziphus jujuba.	ziziphus jujuba alkane

1	Hair growth promoting effect of Zizyphus jujuba essential oil.This study was undertaken to examine the efficacy of essential oil from seeds of Zizyphus jujuba for its potential role on hair growth by in vivo method. Essential oil was applied at different concentrations (0.1%, 1% and 10%) over the shaved skin onto the backs of BALB/c mice and monitored for 21 days. After 21 days, mice treated with 1% and 10% of oil produced a greater effect on the length of hair which were measured to be 9.96 and 10.02 mm, respectively, as compared to the control (8.94 mm). We measured the weight of hair/cm(2) area of dorsal skin and also evaluated hair thickness and hair follicles microscopically after plucking the hair immediately from the shaved area of mice and found the best results for 1% of essential oil-treated mice. From this study, it is concluded that Z. jujuba essential oil possesses hair growth promoting activity.	z. jujuba essential oil
2	Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology of Ziziphus jujuba Mills.Ziziphus jujuba Mills, 'annab' in Iran, 'ber' in India or 'pomme sourette' in France, is a species whose fruit (known warmly as 'the fruits of life' in China) has been consumed for centuries for its nutritional value. The food industry used it as a food additive and flavoring. The dry seeds, the crude leaves and the stem bark are still used in ethnopharmacology to treat digestive disorders and gastric ulcers as antitussive, laxative and hypotensive drugs; even now, it is used in China to treat children who suffer from typhoid fever, furuncle and ecthyma. In Taiwan, the dry seeds for the variety spinosa (Suan Zao Ren) are the second most commonly prescribed and used phytomedicine for insomnia. Its popularity and production have increased worldwide in recent years, especially in Europe. The European Pharmacopoeia Commission has been unable to elaborate upon the EP monograph on Ziziphi spinosae semen as was planned. The EMA has not made its recommendations yet. Is it still a gap in the scientific knowledge? Or is difficult for traditional Chinese medicinal herbs to fulfill the style and quality parameters that are required?

1	Schistosomicidal evaluation of Zanthoxylum naranjillo and its isolated compounds against Schistosoma mansoni adult worms.Chemical investigation of the EtOAc fraction (EF) obtained from the ethanolic extract of Zanthoxylum naranjillo (Rutaceae) leaves (EE) by preparative HPLC resulted in the isolation of protocatechuic acid (1), gallic acid (2), p-hydroxybenzoic acid (3), and 5-O-caffeoylshikimic acid (4). This is the first time that the presence of compounds 1-4 in Z. naranjillo has been reported. Compounds 1-4, the EE, and EF were tested in vitro against Schistosoma mansoni adult worms. The results showed that the S. mansoni daily egg production decreased by 29.8%, 13.5%, 28.4%, 17.7%, 16.3%, and 6.4%, respectively. Compounds 1 and 3 were also able to separate adult worm pairs into male and female. This activity may be correlated with the reduction in egg production, since 1 and 3 showed better inhibitory properties compared with 2 and 4.	zanthoxylum naranjillo p-hydroxybenzoic acid
1	Cinnamaldehyde inhibits the tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced expression of cell adhesion molecules in endothelial cells by suppressing NF-kappaB activation: effects upon IkappaB and Nrf2.The production of adhesion molecules and subsequent attachment of leukocytes to endothelial cells (ECs) are critical early events in atherogenesis. These adhesion molecules thus play an important role in the development of this disease. Recent studies have highlighted the chemoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of cinnamaldehyde, a Cinnamomum cassia Presl-specific diterpene. In our current study, we have examined the effects of both cinnamaldehyde and extracts of C. cassia on cytokine-induced monocyte/human endothelial cell interactions. We find that these compounds inhibit the adhesion of TNFalpha-induced monocytes to endothelial cells and suppress the expression of the cell adhesion molecules, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, at the transcriptional level. Moreover, in TNFalpha-treated ECs, the principal downstream signal of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, NF-kappaB, was also found to be abolished in a time-dependent manner. Interestingly, cinnamaldehyde exerts its anti-inflammatory effects by blocking the degradation of the inhibitory protein IkappaB-alpha, but only in short term pretreatments, whereas it does so via the induction of Nrf2-related genes, including heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1), over long term pretreatments. Treating ECs with zinc protoporphyrin, a HO-1 inhibitor, partially blocks the anti-inflammatory effects of cinnamaldehyde. Elevated HO-1 protein levels were associated with the inhibition of TNFalpha-induced ICAM-1 expression. In addition to HO-1, we also found that cinnamaldehyde can upregulate Nrf2 in nuclear extracts, and can increase ARE-luciferase activity and upregulate thioredoxin reductase-1, another Nrf2-related gene. Moreover, cinnamaldehyde exposure rapidly reduces the cellular GSH levels in ECs over short term treatments but increases these levels after 9 h exposure. Hence, our present findings indicate that cinnamaldehyde suppresses TNF-induced singling pathways via two distinct mechanisms that are activated by different pretreatment periods.	c. cassia cinnamaldehyde
1	Optimization of subcritical extraction process for cinnamon (Cinnamomum Cassia Blume) using response surface methodology.Subcritical extraction was optimized to maximize the extraction yield of flavoring compounds from cinnamon. The extracts of cinnamon were obtained at three different levels of extraction temperature (110-130  C), time (20-60 min), and pressure (20-40 bar). Response surface methodology was used in order to optimize the subcritical extraction process. The suitability of each independent variable in the second-order polynomial regression model was evaluated on the extraction yield and flavoring compound contents. For optimum extraction yield, the optimum temperature, time, and pressure were determined as 130  C, 60 min, and 26.63 bar, respectively. The contents of the flavoring compound predicted at optimum conditions were as follows: 10.01 mg/g at 110  C, 20 min, and 20 bar for coumarin; 4.95 mg/g at 110  C, 20 min, and 32 bar for cinnamic acid; 55 mg/g at 110  C, 34.62 min, and 37 bar for cinnamldehyde; and 4.92 mg/g at 110.9  C, 20 min, and 20 bar for cinnamyl alcohol.	cinnamomum cassia cinnamic acid
2	Cinnamon: a multifaceted medicinal plant.Cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum, and Cinnamon cassia), the eternal tree of tropical medicine, belongs to the Lauraceae family. Cinnamon is one of the most important spices used daily by people all over the world. Cinnamon primarily contains vital oils and other derivatives, such as cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid, and cinnamate. In addition to being an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, anticancer, lipid-lowering, and cardiovascular-disease-lowering compound, cinnamon has also been reported to have activities against neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. This review illustrates the pharmacological prospective of cinnamon and its use in daily life. 	cinnamon Parkinson's
1	(+-)-Asarinin.Asarinin, C(20)H(18)O(6), was isolated as a racemate from the shrub Zanthoxylum alatum. Both forms of the enantiomerically pure substance, (+)- and (-)-asarinin, have been the subject of a total of five previous structure determinations that are essentially identical except for the absolute stereochemistry. However, there seems to be some confusion in the literature concerning these structure determinations of asarinin and also those of its stereoisomer sesamin. The molecular structure of racemic asarinin differs from that of the pure enantiomers in the orientation of one ring system. In the packing of the racemate, molecules are linked by C-H...O interactions to form ribbons parallel to [101].	zanthoxylum alatum asarinin
1	Effect of drying of jujubes (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) on the contents of sugars, organic acids, alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene, and phenolic compounds.This study investigated the changes in sugars, organic acids, alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene, phenolic profiles, total phenolic content (TPC), and antioxidant capacity of jujube fruits after four drying treatments (sun-, oven-, microwave- and freeze-drying). Sugar, organic acid, phenolic compounds, alpha-tocopherol, and beta-carotene were qualitatived and quantitatived by high-performance liquid chromatography. The TPC and antioxidant activity of jujube samples were evaluated using the Folin-Ciocalteau method and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical scavenging activity, respectively. Freeze-drying resulted in jujubes with higher antioxidant activity and was also a good choice for the preparation of beta-carotene from jujubes for the food industry. Microwave-dried jujubes had a higher content of protocatechuic acid, catechin, and epicatechin and maintained the same antioxidant capacity with the freeze-dried jujubes. The combination of microwave- and freeze-drying may be an efficient alternative with shorter processing time and, consequently, less impact on the nutritional value of the jujube.	jujube alpha-tocopherol
2	Inhibitory effect of phytoglycoprotein (24kDa) on allergy-related factors in compound 48/80-induced mast cells in vivo and in vitro.Mast cells are involved in immediate allergic reactions such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis. Allergic reactions caused by extracellular allergens such as xenobiotics may become a critical problem in living circumstances. Recently, we isolated and purified glycoprotein from Zanthoxylum piperitum DC fruit (ZPDC), and demonstrated that ZPDC glycoprotein (5-20mg/kg, 25-100mug/ml) has an inhibitory effect on allergy-related mediators in the compound 48/80-treated BALB/c and human mast cells (HMC-1 cells). Our results obtained from this study showed that ZPDC glycoprotein (10mg/kg) inhibited interleukin-4 (IL-4), immunoglobulin E (IgE), and histamine are released in mouse serum. Also, ZPDC glycoprotein (50mug/ml) attenuated the degranulation of mast cells, intracellular Ca(2+) levels, and the activities of phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB (p50 and p65), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the HMC-1 cells. Taken together, we speculate that the ZPDC glycoprotein might be one component found in natural products that has the ability to prevent dysfunction in the immune system caused by several different allergens.	zanthoxylum piperitum allergy
3	Potent inhibition of human phosphodiesterase-5 by icariin derivatives.Plant extracts traditionally used for male impotence (Tribulus terrestris, Ferula hermonis, Epimedium brevicornum, Cinnamomum cassia), and the individual compounds cinnamaldehyde, ferutinin, and icariin, were screened against phosphodiesterase-5A1 (PDE5A1) activity. Human recombinant PDE5A1 was used as the enzyme source. Only E. brevicornum extract (80% inhibition at 50 microg/mL) and its active principle icariin (1) (IC50 5.9 microM) were active. To improve its inhibitory activity, 1 was subjected to various structural modifications. Thus, 3,7-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)icaritin (5), where both sugars in 1 were replaced with hydroxyethyl residues, potently inhibited PDE5A1 with an IC50 very close to that of sildenafil (IC50 75 vs 74 nM). Thus, 5 was 80 times more potent than 1, and its selectivity versus phosphodiesterase-6 (PDE6) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate-phosphodiesterase (cAMP-PDE) was much higher in comparison with sildenafil. The improved pharmacodynamic profile and lack of cytotoxicity on human fibroblasts make compound 5 a promising candidate for further development.	3,7-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)icaritin cytotoxicity
2	How does traditional knowledge of Cassiae semen shed light on weight management? - A classical and modern literature review.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The seed of Senna obtusifolia (L.) H. S. Irwin & Barneby (Cassiae semen, CS) also known as Jue ming zi in China, has been traditionally used for weight management by purging the liver and improving the liver functions to support digestion. In the past decades, it has been used for hepatoprotection and treatment of overweight and other metabolic disorders such as hyperlipidaemia and diabetes. AIM OF THE REVIEW: This review aimed at providing comprehensive information on the traditional usages, pharmacology, phytochemistry and toxicology of CS and critically exploring its potential usage for clinical weight management from both traditional and modern application perspectives. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In order to fully understand the properties, actions and indications of CS, two sets of Chinese classical texts were searched, namely: Zhong Hua Yi Dian (Encyclopaedia of Traditional Chinese Medicine) and Zhong Guo Ben Cao Quan Shu (Complete Collection of Traditional Texts on Chinese Materia Medica). The purpose of studying these classical texts was to determine the traditional use of CS in weight management. Comprehensive searches were also performed on seven databases for publications on original randomised clinical trials (RCT), in vivo, in vitro or in silico studies related to pharmacological effects of CS. Detailed information about the phytochemistry of CS was collected from books, encyclopedia, online databases and journal literature. FINDINGS: In classical literature review, 89 classic texts provided information of properties, actions and indications of CS. In modern literature review, 44 studies were included for analysis, including 5 RCTs, 7 in vivo studies, 14 in vitro studies, 2 in silico studies and 16 studies of mixed types. Chinese classic literature has provided traditional evidence of the usage of CS for weight management. Contemporary studies have revealed that CS has weight loss effects and possesses some other pharmacological activities supporting weight management. Some chemical compounds of CS have been hypothesised to have a direct or indirect contribution to weight control. CONCLUSIONS: The relationships between chemical compounds and the corresponding weight-loss target proteins are not fully understood. Therefore, CS constituents should be further explored for the development of novel therapeutic or preventive agents for the treatment of overweight and obesity.	senna obtusifolia (l.) h. s. irwin & barneby obesity
2	Cinnamomum cassia bark produced by solid-state fermentation with Phellinus baumii has the potential to alleviate atopic dermatitis-related symptoms.In order to evaluate whether the aqueous fraction of Cinnamomum cassia produced by solid-state fermentation with Phellinus baumii (afCc/Pb) inhibits atopic symptoms in vivo, its efficacy was evaluated in an animal model of 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB)-induced atopic dermatitis. Immune-related cells were quantified using hematoxylin and eosin staining, and phenotypic cytokines, enzymes and the expression of other proteins in the animal model were evaluated. The data revealed that afCc/Pb (100 microg/ml) exhibited strong anti-atopic activity, causing a significant 40% reduction in immune response, as shown by the extent of ear swelling, resulting from a decrease in the number of eosinophils in the skin tissues due to decreased matrix metalloproteinase-2 and interleukin-31 expression. These results collectively suggest that afCc/Pb has the potential to alleviate the symptoms of atopic dermatitis in a mouse model of DNFB-induced atopic dermatitis, and that it may be a valuable bioresource for the cosmetic/cosmeceutical industry.	phellinus baumii atopic dermatitis
2	Cinnamomum cassia Prevents High-Fat Diet-Induced Obesity in Mice through the Increase of Muscle Energy.The cortex of Cinnamomum cassia Presl (Cinnamomi Cortex: CC) has commonly been used for weight control in traditional medicines, but without a scientific basis. Therefore, this study was undertaken to investigate the anti-obesity effect of CC extract in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mouse model and in C2C12 mouse skeletal muscle cells. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed a normal diet or a HFD for 16 consecutive weeks, and orally administered CC extract (100 or 300[Formula: see text]mg/kg) or metformin (250[Formula: see text]mg/kg; positive control) daily for 16 weeks. CC extract administration significantly decreased body weights, food intakes, and serum levels of glucose, insulin, total cholesterol and ALT levels, prevented oral glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, inhibited the protein expressions of MyHC and PGC1[Formula: see text] and the phosphorylation of AMPK, suppressed lipid accumulation in liver, decreased adipocyte size and increased muscle mass in obese mice. For this in vitro study, C2C12 myoblasts were differentiated into the myotubes for five days, and then treated with CC extract (0.1 or 0.2[Formula: see text]mg/ml) for 24[Formula: see text]h. CC extract significantly increased ATP levels by increasing the mRNA expressions of mitochondrial biogenesis-related factors, such as, PGC1[Formula: see text], NRF-1, and Tfam, and the phosphorylations of AMPK and ACC. Our results suggest CC extract controls weight gain in obese mice by inhibiting lipid accumulation and increasing energy expenditure, and that its action mechanism involves the up-regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle cells.	cinnamomum cassia obese
2	Inhibitory effect of 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde on nitric oxide production through inhibition of NF-kappa B activation in RAW 264.7 cells.Cinnamomum cassia has been widely used for treating dyspepsia, gastritis, and inflammatory disease. In the present study, several of cinnamaldehyde derivatives were synthesized from various cinnamic acid based on the 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde isolated from the bark C. cassia Blume was investigated to compare their NO production and NF-kappa B activity from Raw 264.7 cell since nitric oxide (NO) and NF-kappa B have been shown to be implicated factors in the inflammatory disease. The results show that HCA, among the derivatives, most significantly inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NO production and NF-kappa B transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner with an IC(50) value of 8 and 22 microM, respectively. We next investigated putative possible mechanisms of inhibitory effect of HCA on NO production. The inhibition of NO by HCA was consistent with the inhibitory effect on LPS-induced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression. Moreover, HCA inhibited LPS-induced p50 and p65 translocation resulting in the inhibition of the DNA binding activity of the NF-kappa B, a central regulator of iNOS. The present results provided evidence that HCA, among cinnamaledhyde derivatives, has the most inhibitory effect on NO production through inhibition of NF-kappa B activation, and thus can be used as an anti-inflammatory agent.	c. cassia inflammatory disease
3	Anthelmintic efficacy of cinnamaldehyde and cinnamic acid from cortex cinnamon essential oil against Dactylogyrus intermedius.Utilization of chemical pesticide to control monogenean diseases is often restricted in many countries due to the development of pesticide resistance and concerns of chemical residues and environmental contamination. Thus, the use of antiparasitic agents from plants has been explored as a possible way for controlling monogenean infections. Extracts from Cinnamomum cassia were investigated under in vivo conditions against Dactylogyrus intermedius in goldfish. The two bioactive compounds, cinnamaldehyde and cinnamic acid, were identified using nuclear magnetic resonance and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The 48 h median effective concentrations (EC(50)) for these compounds against D. intermedius were 0 57 and 6 32 mg L(-1), respectively. The LD(50) of cinnamaldehyde and cinnamic acid were 13 34 and 59 66 mg L(-1) to goldfish in 48 h acute toxicity tests, respectively. These data confirm that cinnamaldehyde is effective against D. intermedius, and the cinnamaldehyde exhibits potential for the development of a candidate antiparasitic agent.	cinnamaldehyde toxicity
2	Traditional Chinese herbal formula relieves snoring by modulating activities of upper airway related nerves in aged rats.Aim: The present study investigated whether intraperitoneal treatment with the herbal formula B210 ([B210]; a herbal composition of Gastrodia elata and Cinnamomum cassia) can reduce snoring in aged rats. Also, we studied possible neural mechanisms involved in B210 treatment and subsequent reduced snoring in rats. Methods and result: We compared pressure and frequency of snoring, activities of phrenic nerve (PNA), activities of recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLNA) and activities of hypoglossal nerve (HNA), inspiratory time (TI) and expiratory time (TE) of PNA, and pre-inspiratory time (Pre-TI) of HNA in aged rats between sham and B210 treatment groups (30 mg/mL dissolved in DMSO). We found that aged rats that received B210 treatment had significantly reduced pressure and frequency of snoring than rats who received sham treatment. Also, we observed that aged rats that received B210 treatment had significantly increased PNA, RLNA, and HNA, extended TI and TE of PNA, and prolonged Pre-TI of HNA compared to rats that received sham treatment. In other words, B210 treatment may relieve snoring through modulating activities and breathing time of upper airway related nerves in aged rats. Conclusion: We suggested that the B210 might be a potential herbal formula for snoring remission.	gastrodia elata hypoglossal nerve
1	Ethnobotanical survey of antidiarrhoeal plants of Parinche valley, Pune district, Maharashtra, India.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Maharashtra is the third largest state in India with a large tribal population. Documentation of traditional knowledge through ethnobotanical studies is important for conservation and utilization of indigenous knowledge. Diarrhoeal diseases are the second largest cause of morbidity in rural India. Medicinal plants given by the traditional healers of Parinche in Pune district, Maharashtra are known to be efficacious for many common ailments, including diarrhoeal diseases. AIM OF THE STUDY: Ethnobotanical survey of antidiarrhoeal plants from Parinche valley towards the documentation and conservation of traditional knowledge. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Interviews and inquiries were conducted amongst traditional healers, indigenous communities and village elders. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty two plants used by tribes and natives for different ailments were documented of which 28 flowering plants were for diarrhoea. Leaf was the most preferred plant part. Amongst the 28 plants, antidiarrhoeal activity of five plants viz., Caesalpinia sepiaria, Dioscorea pentaphylla, Launaea pinnatifida, Syzygium rubicundum and Ziziphus jujuba has not been reported previously. Two species viz., Ziziphus xylopyra and Syzygium rubicundum are endemic to India. CONCLUSION: Parinche valley is an ethnobotanically rich area with abundant availability and knowledge of medicinal plants that can serve as a model for low cost health care.	dioscorea pentaphylla diarrhoeal diseases
2	Plants used to treat epilepsy by Tanzanian traditional healers.A cross-sectional study performed in Temeke District (Dar es Salaam, Tanzania) showed that 5.5% of the traditional healers have knowledge for the treatment of epilepsy. Of the 100 healers interviewed, 30 (30%) believed that epilepsy was caused by witchcraft, while 19 (19%) thought epilepsy has a genetic origin which can be inherited. Other healers thought epilepsy can be caused by head injury or malaria (24%), and the remaining 27% did not know the cause. Most of the healers (92%) could present an accurate account on the symptoms of the disease, including dizziness, loss of consciousness, abrupt falling down, frothing from the mouth, loss of memory, biting of the tongue, confusion, and restlessness. They showed competence in the treatment of the disease, whereby 60 plants that are commonly used were mentioned. Abrus precatorius L. (Leguminosae), Clausena anisata (Willd.) Oliv. (Rutaceae) and Hoslundia opposita Vahl (Lamiaceae), which are among the plants mentioned, have proven anticonvulsant activity, while a few other species on their list have been reported to be useful in the treatment of epilepsy. Biological testing of these plants, using different models of convulsions is, suggested.	clausena anisata epilepsy
2	Evaluation of the phototoxic potential of plants used in oriental medicine.AIM OF THE STUDY: Phototoxicity can be either harmful or beneficial. Yet the phototoxicity of oriental medicinal plants is an understudied area. The purpose of this study is to fill in this gap. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The phototoxic potential of oriental medicinal plants was examined in vitro using photohemolysis and the Candida albicans test. Seventeen medicinal plants [Acorus gramineus (ACG), Panax ginseng C.A. (PAG), Platycodon grandiflorum (PLG), Aractylodes japonica (ATJ), Xanthium strumarium (XAS), Dioscorea batatas (DIB), Anemarrhena asphodeloides (ANA), Polygonatum sibiricum Red (PSR), Cocculus trilobus (COT), Ficus carica (FIC), Chelidonium majus var. asiaticum (CMA), Pulsatilla koreana (PUK), Agrimonia pilosa (AGP), Zanthoxylum schinifolium (ZAS), Angelica gigas (ANG), Ledebouriella seseloides (LES), and Cnidium officinale (CNO)] were selected because they showed strong fluorescence in one of our previous studies of 62 plants. We further evaluated in vivo phototoxicity in mice. 0.75 mL/kg of seed oil for Xanthium strumarium (XAS, ), or 1.25 mL/kg of extracted solutions of Atractylodes japonica (ATJ, ), Chelidonium majus var. asiaticum (CMA, ), Zanthoxylum schinifolium (ZAS, ), and Ledebouriella seseloides (LES, ) were given once, and evaluated for sunburn edema, formation of sunburn cell, decrease of epidermal Langerhans cells and local suppression of contact hypersensitivity by UVA irradiation. RESULTS: Sixteen out of the 17 plants tested except COT showed significant photohemolysis, and 5 of those exhibited phototoxic killing of Candida albicans. The phototoxicity of oriental medicines using those 5 plants was then studied in mice. The 5 plants increased sunburn edema and formation of sunburn cell, and suppressed immune responses locally by decreasing epidermal Langerhans cells and contact hypersensitivity by UVA irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: More than a quarter of oriental medicinal plants can be phototoxic, and strong fluorescence measured by absorption and fluorescence spectra can be an easier way to screen for phototoxicity. On the other hand, the phototoxicity of the plants may also be used therapeutically. Further studies regarding the phototoxicity of active components extracted from both live and dried oriental medicinal plants are necessary.	candida albicans hypersensitivity
1	In vitro activities of plant extracts on human Loa loa isolates and cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells.Loa loa, a filarial worm, can cause fatal encephalitis in humans. In an attempt to find alternatives to the standard treatments (ivermectin and diethylcarbamazine citrate), we tested 12 methanolic extracts of nine traditional plant remedies. The extracts (100-0.09 microg/ml) were incubated with 20 Loa loa microfilariae isolated from patients at 37 degrees C with 5% CO(2) in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal serum and antibiotics. Activity was evaluated 120 h later by counting live microfilariae under a microscope. Cytotoxicity for eukaryotic cells was estimated by measuring 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2-5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide transformation to formazan at 450 nM in a spectrophotometer. The plants tested were Lophira alata, Greenwayodendron suaveolens, Uapaca togoensis, Zanthoxylum heitzii, Peperomia pellucida, Piptadeniastrum africanum, Petersianthus macrocarpus, Vernonia conferta, and Vernonia hymenolepis. Chemical screening showed that most of the extracts contained reducing sugars, tannin or polyphenols, sterols or triterpenes, saponosides, and alkaloids. None contained carotinoids and few contained flavonoids. The 50% lethal concentration ranged from 0.22 to 70.28 microg/ml, while the 50% inhibitory concentration for eukaryotic cells (IC(50)) ranged from 8.52 to 119.52 microg/ml. Extracts of P. macrocarpus (selectivity index = 72.16), P. africanum (13.69), Z. heitzii (12.11), and L. alata (9.26) were highly selective for L. loa.	p. africanum sterols
2	Preventive effects of ZPDC glycoprotein (24 kDa) on hepatotoxicity induced by mercury chloride in vitro and in vivo.Mercury is a potent environmental contaminant that exerts toxic effect on various vital organs in the human body. Recently, we isolated glycoprotein from Zanthoxylum piperitum DC (ZPDC), which has antioxidant and anticancer effects. In the present study, we determined the preventive effects of ZPDC glycoprotein on hepatic damage induced by mercury chloride (HgCl2 ). We evaluated the activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), antioxidant enzymes [superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)], extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), cyclo-oxygenase (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS), and activator protein (AP-1) and the quantitative expressions of nuclear factor E2-related factor (Nrf2), heme oxygenase (HO-1), metallothionein (MT) and reduced glutathione (GSH) in mercury-chloride-exposed (50 muM and 10 mg/kg body weight) primary cultured hepatocytes and ICR mice, using biochemical assays, radioactivity and immunoblot analysis. The results demonstrated that ZPDC glycoprotein decreased the levels of LDH, ALT, HO-1 and MT, whereas it increased the activities of hepatic antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT and GPx) and reduced GSH in mercury-chloride-exposed primary cultured hepatocytes. Also, it suppressed arachidonic acid release and expression of ERK, p38 MAPK, COX-2, iNOS, AP-1 and Nrf-2 in primary cultured hepatocytes and ICR mice exposed to mercury chloride. Collectively, ZPDC glycoprotein may have potential applications to prevent hepatotoxicity induced by mercury chloride.	zanthoxylum piperitum hepatotoxicity
3	Effect of shodhana on the toxicity of abrus precatorius.Seeds of Gunja (Abrus precatorius Linn) are reported to be poisonous due to the presence of a toxic protein 'abrin and an alkaloid hypaphorine. Te seeds after subjecting to the process of shodhana, find use in a number of Ayurvedic preparations. HPLC studies revealed that the process of shodhana resulted in depletion of more toxic alkaloid hypaphorine and protein abrin.	hypaphorine toxicity
1	Two pairs of enantiomeric propylated flavonoids and a new lignan from the aerial parts of Abrus precatorius.Two pairs of novel enantiomeric flavonoids (1a, 1b and 2a, 2b), along with one new lignan (3), were isolated from the aerial parts of Abrus precatorius. All of these enantiomeric flavonoids featured an unprecedented propylated flavonoid skeleton representing a new family of flavonoid, and the new lignan was found to have an attractive arachidate ester side chain. Their structures were extensively elucidated by means of detailed NMR and mass spectroscopic analysis. Moreover, biological evaluation of antibacterial activity for these compounds against Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli were conducted.	abrus precatorius lignan
1	The jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) fruit: a review of current knowledge of fruit composition and health benefits.The nutritional jujube ( Ziziphus jujube Mill.) fruit belonging to the Rhamnaceous family grows mostly in Europe, southern and eastern Asia, and Australia, especially the inland region of northern China. Jujube has a long history of usage as a fruit and remedy. The main biologically active components are vitamin C, phenolics, flavonoids, triterpenic acids, and polysaccharides. Recent phytochemical studies of jujube fruits have shed some light on their biological effects, such as the anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antiobesity, immunostimulating, antioxidant, hepatoprotective, and gastrointestinal protective activities and inhibition of foam cell formation in macrophages. A stronger focus on clinical studies and phytochemical definition of jujube fruits will be essential for future research efforts. This review may be useful for predicting other medicinal uses and potential drug or food interactions and may be beneficial for people living where the jujube fruits are prevalent and health care resources are scarce.	jujube polysaccharides
3	In vitro cytotoxic activity of isolated acridones alkaloids from Zanthoxylum leprieurii Guill. et Perr.Chemical investigation of the roots and fruits of Zanthoxylumleprieurii Guill. et Perr. led to the isolation of three new alkaloids including two acridone derivatives, 3-hydroxy-1,4-dimethoxy-10-methyl-9-acridone (2) and 3-hydroxy-1,2-dimethoxy-10-methyl-9-acridone (3) named helebelicine A and B, respectively, and one secobenzo[c]phenantridine, 10-O-demethyl-12-O-methylarnottianamide (10), together with thirteen other compounds. The structures of compounds 2, 3 and 10 as well as those of the known compounds were elucidated by using spectroscopic methods and by comparison with reported data. The brine-shrimp (artemia salina) lethality bioassay of the chloroform extract of the fruits showed modest cytotoxicity with LD(50) at 13.1microg/mL. Isolated compounds 1, 4-6 were found to be moderately active against lung carcinoma cells (A549), colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (DLD-1) and normal cells (WS1) with IC(50) values ranging from 27 to 77microM. In contrast to the positive control etoposide used, the cytotoxicity of the most active compound 4 was found to be selective against cancer cells in comparison to normal cells WS1 with IC(50) of 51+/-8microM and 4.3+/-0.4microM, respectively.	acridones alkaloids colorectal adenocarcinoma
1	Analysis of volatile components, fatty acids, and phytosterols of Abies koreana growing in Poland.Extracts and essential oils from seeds as well as essential oils from cone scales and needles with twigs of the Abies koreana population were studied. An analysis of Korean fir essential oils allowed us to determine 147 volatile compounds. The identified compounds constituted 97-99% of the seed, cone and needle oils. The main volatile in the seed and needle oils was limonene (56.6% and 23.4%, respectively), while the predominant volatile in cone oils was alpha-pinene (51.2%). Korean fir seeds provided a rich source of both essential oil (3.8-8.5%) and extract, which was isolated with a 24.5% yield and contained numerous groups of fatty acids and phytosterols (414 microg/100g extract). The most prominent fatty acids were unsaturated, among which linoleic (41.2%) and oleic (31.2%) fatty acid were the main ones while the dominant sterols were isomers of ergostadienol and beta-sitosterol. A. koreana seeds, cones and needles are a source of many volatile bioactive compounds while the seed extract, with a pleasant scent, contained not only volatiles, but also fractions rich in fatty acids and phytosterols. These facts make A. koreana essential oils and especially the seed extract potential components of cosmetics.	a. koreana phytosterols
1	Evaluation of the antioxidant effects of Ziziphus mauritiana Lam. Leaf extracts against chronic ethanol-induced hepatotoxicity in rat liver.Chronic alcohol ingestion is known to increase the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby leading to liver damage. Antioxidant enzymes act individually or in combination to reduce or counter the effect of these ROS. Chronic administration of alcohol at (40% v/v, 1 ml/100 g), for 6 weeks showed a significant (p&lt;0.05) elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bilirubin (TB). There was also a significant (p&lt;0.05) decreased levels of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and superoxide dismutase compared to control rats. Pre-treatment of rats with 200, 400 mg/kg body weight of aqueous leaf extract of Ziziphus mauritiana or 100 mg/kg silymarin resulted in a significant (p&lt;0.05) decreased levels of ALT, AST, ALP, and TB with levels of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and superoxide dismutase showing a significant (p&lt;0.05) increase compared to group administered alcohol only. Histopathology of rat liver administered with alcohol only resulted in severe necrosis, mononuclear cell aggregation and fatty degeneration in the central and mid zonal areas which was a characteristic of a damaged liver. Pre-treatment with the aqueous extract of Ziziphus mauritiana or silymarin reduced the morphological changes that are associated with chronic alcohol administration. The presence of tannins, saponins and phenolic compounds observed in the plant extract could be responsible for the observed effects of decreasing the levels of injured tissue marker and lipid peroxidation.	ziziphus mauritiana tannins
4	Total flavone of Abelmoschus manihot suppresses epithelial-mesenchymal transition via interfering transforming growth factor-beta1 signaling in Crohn's disease intestinal fibrosis.AIM: To explore the role and mechanism of total flavone of Abelmoschus manihot (TFA) on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progress of Crohn's disease (CD) intestinal fibrosis. METHODS: First, CCK-8 assay was performed to assess TFA on the viability of intestinal epithelial (IEC-6) cells and select the optimal concentrations of TFA for our further studies. Then cell morphology, wound healing and transwell assays were performed to examine the effect of TFA on morphology, migration and invasion of IEC-6 cells treated with TGF-beta1. In addition, immunofluorescence, real-time PCR analysis (qRT-PCR) and western blotting assays were carried out to detect the impact of TFA on EMT progress. Moreover, western blotting assay was performed to evaluate the function of TFA on the Smad and MAPK signaling pathways. Further, the role of co-treatment of TFA and si-Smad or MAPK inhibitors has been examined by qRT-PCR, western blotting, morphology, wound healing and transwell assays. RESULTS: In this study, TFA promoted transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1)-induced (IEC-6) morphological change, migration and invasion, and increased the expression of epithelial markers and reduced the levels of mesenchymal markers, along with the inactivation of Smad and MAPK signaling pathways. Moreover, we revealed that si-Smad and MAPK inhibitors effectively attenuated TGF-beta1-induced EMT in IEC-6 cells. Importantly, co-treatment of TFA and si-Smad or MAPK inhibitors had better inhibitory effects on TGF-beta1-induced EMT in IEC-6 cells than either one of them. CONCLUSION: These findings could provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms of TFA on TGF-beta1-induced EMT in IEC-6 cells and TFA is expected to advance as a new therapy to treat CD intestinal fibrosis.

0	Hydroxy-alpha-sanshool activates TRPV1 and TRPA1 in sensory neurons.Sanshools are major active ingredients of Zanthoxylum piperitum and are used as food additives in East Asia. Sanshools cause irritant, tingling and sometimes paresthetic sensations on the tongue. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the pungent or tingling sensation induced by sanshools is not known. Because many transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are responsible for the sensations induced by various spices and food additives, we expressed 17 TRP channels in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells and investigated their activation by hydroxy-alpha-sanshool (HalphaSS) or hydroxy-beta-sanshool (HbetaSS) isolated from Zanthoxylum piperitum. It was found that HalphaSS, but not HbetaSS, depolarized sensory neurons with concomitant firing of action potentials and evoked inward currents. Among 17 TRP channels expressed in HEK cells, HalphaSS caused Ca(2+) influx in cells transfected with TRPV1 or TRPA1, and evoked robust inward currents in cells transfected with TRPV1 or TRPA1. In primary cultured sensory neurons, HalphaSS induced inward currents and Ca(2+) influx in a capsazepine-dependent manner. Moreover, HalphaSS-induced currents and Ca(2+) influx were greatly diminished in TRPV1(-/-) mice. HalphaSS evoked licking behavior when injected into a single hind paw of wild-type mice, but this was much reduced in TRPV1-deficient mice. These results indicate that TRPV1 and TRPA1 are molecular targets of HalphaSS in sensory neurons. We conclude that the activations of TRPV1 and TRPA1 by HalphaSS explain its unique pungent, tingling sensation.	HalphaSS TRPA1

3	Antimicrobial activities of cinnamon oil and cinnamaldehyde from the Chinese medicinal herb Cinnamomum cassia Blume.Both Cinnamomum verum J.S. Presl. and Cinnamomum cassia Blume are collectively called Cortex Cinnamonmi for their medicinal cinnamon bark. Cinnamomum verum is more popular elsewhere in the world, whereas C. cassia is a well known traditional Chinese medicine. An analysis of hydro-distilled Chinese cinnamon oil and pure cinnamaldehyde by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry revealed that cinnamaldehyde is the major component comprising 85% in the essential oil and the purity of cinnamaldehyde in use is high (&gt; 98%). Both oil and pure cinnamaldehyde of C. cassia were equally effective in inhibiting the growth of various isolates of bacteria including Gram-positive (1 isolate, Staphylococcus aureus), and Gram-negative (7 isolates, E. coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Samonella typhymurium), and fungi including yeasts (four species of Candida, C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, and C. krusei), filamentous molds (4 isolates, three Aspergillus spp. and one Fusarium sp.) and dermatophytes (three isolates, Microsporum gypseum, Trichophyton rubrum and T. mentagraphytes). Their minimum inhibition concentrations (MIC) as determined by agar dilution method varied only slightly. The MICs of both oil and cinnamaldehyde for bacteria ranged from 75 microg/ml to 600 microg/ml, for yeasts from 100 microg/ml to 450 microg/ml, for filamentous fungi from 75 microg/ml to 150 microg/ml, and for dermatophytes from 18.8 microg/ml to 37.5 microg/ml. The antimicrobial effectiveness of C. cassia oil and its major constituent is comparable and almost equivalent, which suggests that the broad-spectrum antibiotic activities of C. cassia oil are due to cinnamaldehyde. The relationship between structure and function of the main components of cinnamon oil is also discussed.	cinnamaldehyde antibiotic activities
2	Histochemical localization of glycoconjugates in the developing endolymphatic sac and vestibular end organs of the mouse.The distribution of glycoconjugates in the endolymphatic sac (ES) and vestibular end organs from the 12th gestational day (GD) in the developing mouse to the 6th day after birth was analyzed using six biotinylated lectins: wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), Abrus precatorius agglutinin (APA), Ulex europaeus agglutinin I (UEA-I), Ricinus communis agglutinin 120 (RCA120), Helix pomatia agglutinin (HPA), concanavalin A (conA). In the 13th and 15th GD sections, the luminal contents in the fetal ES were strongly labelled with lectins, while only a small amount of substance in the ES was labelled with lectins after the 17th GD. In the 13th GD sections, before the cupula and otoconia were formed, the fetal ES started to produce glycoconjugates labelled with WGA, APA, RCA120 and ConA. In the 17th GD sections, the immature cupula and otoconia were strongly labelled with WGA, APA and RCA120. Sugar residues stained by lectins detected in the substance of the fetal ES were the same as those found in the immature cupula and otoconia. HPA only stained the ES epithelium around the 13th and 15th GD. The fetal ES may interact with the formation of the cupula and otoconia, especially in the early stage during evolution and that HPA-reactive glycoconjugates may be related to the intracellular elements of the ES epithelium only during a well-defined phase of development.	abrus precatorius otoconia
1	Antiproliferative Activity of Cinnamomum cassia Constituents and Effects of Pifithrin-Alpha on Their Apoptotic Signaling Pathways in Hep G2 Cells.Cinnamaldehyde (Cin), cinnamic acid (Ca) and cinnamyl alcohol (Cal), major constituents of Cinnamomum cassia, have been shown to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer and other activities. In this study, our aim was to evaluate the antiproliferative activity of these compounds in human hepatoma Hep G2 cells and examine the effects of pifithrin-alpha (PFTalpha; a specific p53 inhibitor) on their apoptotic signaling transduction mechanism. The antiproliferative activity was measured by XTT assay. Expression of apoptosis-related proteins was detected by western blotting. Results showed that at a concentration of 30 muM, the order of antiproliferative activity in Hep G2 cells was Cin &gt; Ca &gt; Cal. Cin (IC(50) 9.76 +- 0.67 muM) demonstrated an antiproliferative potency as good as 5-fluorouracil (an anti-cancer drug; IC(50) 9.57 +- 0.61 muM). Further studies on apoptotic mechanisms of Cin showed that it downregulated the expression of Bcl-(XL), upregulated CD95 (APO-1), p53 and Bax proteins, as well as cleaving the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in a time-dependent pattern. PFTalpha pre-incubation significantly diminished the effect of Cin-induced apoptosis. It markedly upregulated the anti-apoptotic (Bcl-(XL)) expression and downregulated the pro-apoptotic (Bax) expression, as well as effectively blocking the CD95 (APO-1) and p53 expression, and PARP cleavage in Cin-treated cells. This study indicates that Cin was the most potent antiproliferative constituent of C. cassia, and its apoptotic mechanism in Hep G2 cells could be mediated through the p53 induction and CD95 (APO-1) signaling pathways.	c. cassia cinnamic acid
1	Zizimauritic acids A-C, three novel nortriterpenes from Ziziphus mauritiana.Zizimauritic acids A-C (1-3), three novel nortriterpenes with a unique A-nor-E-seco spiro-lactone ceanothane-type triterpene skeleton, together with 3 known triterpenes ceanothenic acid (4), betulinic acid (5), and ceanothic acid (6), were isolated from the roots of Ziziphus mauritiana. Compounds 1-4 showed cytotoxicities with the IC(50) values ranging from 5.05 to 11.94 mug/ml, and compounds 1 and 3 showed an inhibitory effect on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus with the IC(50) values 2.17 and 12.79 mug/ml. A plausible biosynthetic pathway of compounds 1-3 was proposed.	ziziphus mauritiana a-nor-e-seco spiro-lactone
1	Characterization and immunomodulatory activity of polysaccharides from the stems and leaves of Abelmoschus manihot and a sulfated derivative.BACKGROUND: Abelmoschus manihot (Linn.) Medicus is a traditional herbal medicine whose flowers, stems and leaves exhibit widely pharmacological activities. However, only the flowers have long been used as medicine while the stems and leaves were mainly discarded and burned, which undoubtedly caused enormous waste of these resources and serious environment pollution. Many researches have indicated that bioactivities of polysaccharides were significantly improved after sulfation. The aim of this study was to investigate the characterization and immunomodulatory activity of polysaccharides from stems and leaves of A. manihot and a sulfated derivative. RESULTS: A mixed neutral polysaccharide (SLAMP-a) and two acidic polysaccharides (SLAMP-c and SLAMP-d) were obtained from stems and leaves of A. manihot by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. SLAMP-a was a water-insoluble mixture while its sulfated derivative (S-SLAMP-a3), prepared with aminosulfonic acid, was a homogeneous polysaccharide with excellent solubility. The average molecular weights of S-SLAMP-a3, SLAMP-c and SLAMP-d were 1044.2kDa, 477.8kDa and 264.2kDa respectively. SLAMP-a and its sulfate mainly contained glucose, and SLAMP-c and SLAMP-d were both composed of mannose, rhamnose, glucuronic acid, glucose, galactose, and arabinose. In vitro study indicated that S-SLAMP-a3, SLAMP-c and SLAMP-d exhibited significant immunomodulatory activity, while SLAMP-a showed little effects. CONCLUSION: SLAMP-c and SLAMP-d from A. manihot stems and leaves could be explored as immunomodulatory agents, which would provide a way to utilize these enormously discarded resources and avoid massive waste. Additionally, the neutral polysaccharide, SLAMP-a, could also be developed after sulfation, suggesting that these disused resources would be further used effectively.	a. manihot polysaccharide
1	Xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity of constituents of Cinnamomum cassia twigs.A methanol extract of the twigs of Cinnamomum cassia was found to inhibit xanthine oxidase. Purification of the methanol extract afforded three new phenolic glycosides, cinnacasolide A-C (11-13), together with 10 known compounds (1-10). The structures of the three new compounds were determined by interpretation of spectroscopic data. Cinnamaldehyde derivatives 1-5 and 7 were significant inhibitors of xanthine oxidase, with IC(50) values ranging from 7.8 to 36.3 mug/mL. The results indicate that the acyl group of these cinnamaldehyde derivatives plays an important role in the inhibition of xanthine oxidase.	cinnamomum cassia cinnamaldehyde
1	Phenolic compounds of Abies nephrolepis and their NO production inhibitory activities.Two new, i.e., 1 and 2, and 69 known phenolics were isolated from the aerial parts of Abies nephrolepis. These chemical constituents included 22 lignans, 30 flavonoids, and 19 other phenols. Their structures were determined mainly by analysis of the 1D- and 2D-NMR spectroscopic data. All the 71 isolates were evaluated for their inhibitory activities against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NO production in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Compound 1 exhibited a potent effect with an IC(50) value of 13.7 mug/ml.	abies nephrolepis flavonoids
2	The Effect of Cinnamon on Glucose of Type II Diabetes Patients.The incidence of type II diabetes is increasing across the world. Dietary modifications help the patients to control blood glucose. Traditional herbs and spices are commonly used for control of glucose among which cinnamon (Rou Gui; Cinnamomum cassia) has the greatest effect. Research has shown that adding cinnamon to diet can help to lower the glucose level. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of cinnamon on the glucose level in blood. This was a Randomized clinical trial in which 70 Patients with type II diabetes were assigned randomly two groups (35 in cinnamon and 35 in placebo group). The groups were matched in terms of body mass index (BMI), HbAlc and fasting blood sugar (FBS). Patients were treated with cinnamon and the placebo group was treated with placebo in addition to their routine treatment for 60 days. FBG levels and glycosylated hemoglobin of patients on the first day, and 1 and 2 months after treatment were measured. Data were analyzed using t-test and paired t-test in Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS).16 software. The mean levels of FBS before, and 1 and 2 months after the intervention were 174 +- 59, 169 +- 43 and 177 +- 45; respectively. The levels of HbAlc before and after the intervention in the cinnamon group were (8.9 +- 1.7 and 8.9 +- 1.6). There was no significant difference in FBS and glycosylated hemoglobin levels between the two groups (P = 0.738 and P = 0.87, respectively). Results showed that using certain amount of cinnamon for 60 days did not change the glucose level of diabetic patients. So, using cinnamon to type II diabetes patients cannot be recommended and more studies are needed in future. 	cinnamon type ii diabetes
1	High-performance liquid chromatography--two wavelength detection of triterpenoid acids from the fruits of Ziziphus jujuba containing various cultivars in different regions and classification using chemometric analysis.A simple and sensitive HPLC-DAD method has been developed for the first time to simultaneously determine 10 triterpenoid acids (ceanothic acid, alphitolic acid, zizyberanal acid, zizyberanalic acid, epiceanothic acid, ceanothenic acid, betulinic acid, oleanolic acid, ursonic acid and zizyberenalic acid) in the dried fruit of Ziziphus jujuba (called Dazao) which has been widely used as one of the traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs). This HPLC assay was performed on a reversed-phase C(18) column (250 mm x 4.6mm, 5 microm) with the column temperature at 35 degrees C. The mobile phase was composed of A (acetonitrile) and B (0.05% aqueous phosphoric acid, v/v). The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min and the detection wave length was set at 205 nm for reference compounds 1-9 and 238 nm for reference compound 10. All calibration curves showed good linear regression (r(2)&gt;0.9999) within the test range. The established method showed good precision and accuracy with overall intra-day and inter-day variations of 0.43-1.72% and 0.53-2.45%, respectively, and overall recoveries of 94.98-104.09% for the 10 compounds analyzed. The validated method was successfully applied for the simultaneous determination of the 10 triterpenoid acids in 42 batches of Dazao which contained 36 cultivars from 22 cultivation regions, and were investigated and authenticated as Z. jujuba. Hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) and principal components analysis (PCA) were performed to differentiate and classify the samples based on the contents of the 10 triterpenoid acids. The presented HPLC-DAD method conjugated with chemometrics approach was demonstrated to be very helpful in using Dazao resources, and was possibly useful in chemotaxonomic characterization.	z. jujuba ceanothic acid
4	Abrus precatorius agglutinin-derived peptides induce ROS-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis through JNK and Akt/P38/P53 pathways in HeLa cells.10kDAGP, a tryptic digest of Abrus precatorius lectin 'Agglutinin' is known to induce apoptosis by mitochondria-dependent pathways in human cervical cancer (HeLa) cells. The present study was focused on deciphering the detailed molecular mechanism of apoptosis induction in vitro by 10kDAGP and also its in vivo therapeutic efficacy. For in vivo model, HeLa cell encapsulated hollow fiber was implanted in Swiss Albino mice and treated with 10kDAGP. Our results showed that 10kDAGP was able to enter the cell within a span of 20min and co-localized with mitochondria after 90min. of incubation. A drastic loss of mitochondrial membrane potential was noted within 6h of 10kDAGP administration along with an increase in ROS generation. ROS further led to symptoms of early apoptosis by deregulating Akt (Protein Kinase B) and activating c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK), p38 Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK), p53, and autophagy starting from ~8h of incubation. Besides in vitro conditions, 10kDAGP activated JNK to mediate cancer cell killing in vivo. Therefore, 10kDAGP can be an excellent therapeutic agent as it can act through different ways in the cellular system. Future studies are directed to screen out active peptides from the pool of peptides and to study whether the mode of action is in synergistic way or in individual forms. 	P38/P53 cancer
2	Tyrosinase inhibitor isolated from the leaves of Zanthoxylum piperitum.Two flavonols, quercetin (1) and quercitrin (2), were isolated from the leaves of Zanthoxylum piperitum. Their structures were established by UV, one- and two-dimensional NMR, and mass spectroscopic methods. Quercetin showed significant inhibition against mushroom tyrosinase with an IC50 value of 3.8 microg/ml, and appeared to inhibit the polyphenol oxidase activity of tyrosinase in a competitive manner (Ki = 10 +/- 0.20 microM) when L-tyrosine was used as a substrate, although it did not inhibit the melanin production of Streptomyces bikiniensis.	zanthoxylum piperitum flavonols
2	Traditional Japanese medicines inhibit compound action potentials in the frog sciatic nerve.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Traditional Japanese (Kampo) medicines have a variety of clinical effects including pain alleviation, but evidence for a mechanism for their pain relief has not yet been elucidated fully. Considering that Kampo medicine contains many plant-derived chemicals having an ability to inhibit nerve action potential conduction, it is possible that this medicine inhibits nerve conduction. The purpose of the present study was to know how various Kampo medicines affect nerve conduction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined the effects of Kampo and crude medicines on compound action potentials (CAPs) recorded from the frog sciatic nerve by using the air-gap method. RESULTS: Daikenchuto, rikkosan, kikyoto, rikkunshito, shakuyakukanzoto and kakkonto concentration-dependently reduced the peak amplitude of the CAP. Among the Kampo medicines, daikenchuto was the most effective in inhibiting CAPs. Daikenchuto is composed of three kinds of crude medicine, Japanese pepper, processed ginger and ginseng radix. When the crude medicines were tested, Japanese pepper and processed ginger reduced CAP peak amplitudes, while ginseng radix hardly affected CAPs. Moreover, there was an interaction between the Japanese pepper and processed ginger activities in such that one medicine at low but not high concentrations increased the extent of the inhibition by the other one that was co-applied. CONCLUSIONS: Kampo medicines have an ability to inhibit nerve conduction. This action of daikenchuto is due to Japanese pepper and processed ginger but not ginseng radix, probably through an interaction between Japanese pepper and processed ginger in a manner dependent on their concentrations. Nerve conduction inhibition could contribute to at least a part of Kampo medicine's clinical effects such as pain alleviation.	ginger pain
2	Evaluation of natural products on inhibition of inducible cyclooxygenase (COX-2) and nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in cultured mouse macrophage cells.The inhibitors of prostaglandin biosynthesis and nitric oxide production have been considered as potential anti-inflammatory and cancer chemopreventive agents. In this study, we evaluated approximately 170 methanol extracts of natural products including Korean herbal medicines for the inhibition of prostaglandin E(2) production (for COX-2 inhibitors) and nitric oxide formation (for iNOS inhibitors) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophages RAW264.7 cells. As a result, several extracts such as Aristolochia debilis, Cinnamomum cassia, Cinnamomum loureirii, Curcuma zedoaria, Eugenia caryophyllata, Pterocarpus santalius, Rehmania glutinosa and Tribulus terrestris showed potent inhibition of COX-2 activity (&gt;80% inhibition at the test concentration of 10 micro g/ml). In addition, the extracts of A. debilis, Caesalpinia sappan, Curcuma longa, C. zedoaria, Daphne genkwa and Morus alba were also considered as potential inhibitors of iNOS activity (&gt;70% inhibition at the test concentration of 10 micro g/ml). These active extracts mediating COX-2 and iNOS inhibitory activities are warranted for further elucidation of active principles for development of new cancer chemopreventive and/or anti-inflammatory agents.	morus alba cancer
1	Evaluation of thermal-oxidative stability and antiglioma activity of Zanthoxylum tingoassuiba essential oil entrapped into multi- and unilamellar liposomes.Zanthoxylum tinguassuiba essential oil (ZtEO) contains alpha-bisabolol, a known antiglioma sesquiterpene, among other potentially active substances. Medical applications of this essential oil require advances in the design of distinctive carriers due to its low water solubility and easy degradation by heat, light, and oxygen. The aim of this work was to evaluate enhancement in oxidative stability and the ability to reduce glioblastoma cell viability of ZtEO loaded into liposomes. Multi- and unilamellar vesicles were prepared to carry ZtEO. By using thermal analysis, it was observed that thermal-oxidative stability of the liposomal ZtEO was enhanced, when compared to its free form. Liposomal ZtEO also presented significant apoptotic-inducing activity for glioma cells. These results show that liposomal systems carrying ZtEO may be a potential alternative for gliobastoma treatment.	Zanthoxylum essential oil
2	The effect of medicinal plants of Islamabad and Murree region of Pakistan on insulin secretion from INS-1 cells.In vitro testing of the extracts of medicinal plants collected from Islamabad and the Murree region on insulin secretagogue activity was carried out. Dried ethanol extracts of all plants (ZH1-ZH19) were dissolved in ethanol and DMSO, and tested at various concentrations (between 1 and 40 microg/mL) for insulin release from INS-1 cells in the presence of 5.5 mM glucose. Glibenclamide was used as a control. Promising insulin secretagogue activity in various plant extracts at 1, 10, 20 and 40 microg/mL was found, while in some cases a decrease in insulin secretion was also observed. Artemisia roxburghiana, Salvia coccinia and Monstera deliciosa showed insulin secretagogue activity at 1 microg/mL (p &lt; 0.05) while Abies pindrow, Centaurea iberica and Euphorbia helioscopia were active at 10 microg/mL (p &lt; 0.05). Extracts of Bauhinia variegata and Bergenia himalacia showed effects at 20 microg/mL (p &lt; 0.05), and Taraxacum officinale and Viburnum foetens at 40 microg/mL (p &lt; 0.05). Insulin secretagogue activity could not be detected in the extracts of Adhatoda vasica, Cassia fistula, Chrysanthemum leucanthemum, Morus alba, Plectranthus rugosus, Peganum harmala and Olea ferruginea. The results suggest that medicinal plants of Islamabad and the Murree region of Pakistan may be potential natural resources for antidiabetic compounds.	salvia coccinia insulin secretion
1	Derivatives of the Lignan 7'-Hydroxymatairesinol with Antioxidant Properties and Enhanced Lipophilicity.The lignan 7'-hydroxymatairesinol (1), extracted from the knotwoods of fir (Abies alba), spruce (Picea abies), and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), exhibited unexpected reactivity when esterification reactions were attempted on the hydroxy group at position C-7'. To circumvent the rapid intramolecular cyclization procedure, leading quantitatively to the lignan conidendrin (7), a simple strategy for 7'-esterification of 1 under mild conditions (three steps, up to 80% overall yield) was developed. Compared to hydroxymatairesinol (1) (log K'w = 1.49), the derivatives (2-5) had increased lipophilicity with log K'w &gt; 3.1, as determined by a UHPLC method. Compounds 1-5 exhibited potent antioxidant properties in the same range as the standards ascorbic acid and alpha-tocopherol (IC50 = 20-25 muM) and higher than that of BHT using a DPPH radical-scavenging assay.	pseudotsuga menziesii lignan 7'-hydroxymatairesinol
2	Abrus agglutinin is a potent anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic agent in human breast cancer.Abrus agglutinin (AGG), a plant lectin isolated from the seeds of Abrus precatorius, has documented antitumor and immunostimulatory effects in murine models. To examine possible antitumor activity against breast cancer, we established human breast tumor xenografts in athymic nude mice and intraperitoneally administered AGG. AGG inhibited tumor growth and angiogenesis as confirmed by monitoring the expression of Ki-67 and CD-31, respectively. In addition, TUNEL positive cells increased in breast tumors treated with AGG suggesting that AGG mediates anti-tumorigenic activity through induction of apoptosis and inhibition of angiogenesis. On a molecular level, AGG caused extrinsic apoptosis through ROS generation that was AKT-dependent in breast cancer cells, without affecting primary mammary epithelial cells, suggesting potential cancer specificity of this natural compound. In addition, using HUVECs, AGG inhibited expression of the pro-angiogenic factor IGFBP-2 in an AKT-dependent manner, reducing angiogenic phenotypes both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, the present results establish that AGG promotes both apoptosis and anti-angiogenic activities in human breast tumor cells, which might be exploited for treatment of breast and other cancers.	abrus precatorius breast tumor
1	Evaluation of chemical components and properties of the jujube fruit using near infrared spectroscopy and chemometrics.Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) calibrations were developed for the discrimination of spectra of the jujube (Zizyphus jujuba Mill.) fruit samples from four geographical regions. Prediction models were developed for the quantitative prediction of the contents of jujube fruit, i.e., total sugar, total acid, total phenolic content, and total antioxidant activity. Four pattern recognition methods, principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), least squares-support vector machines (LS-SVM), and back propagation-artificial neural networks (BP-ANN), were used for the geographical origin classification. Furthermore, three multivariate calibration models based on the standard normal variate (SNV) pretreated NIR spectroscopy, partial least squares (PLS), BP-ANN, and LS-SVM were constructed for quantitative analysis of the four analytes described above. PCA provided a useful qualitative plot of the four types of NIR spectra from the fruit. The LS-SVM model produced best quantitative prediction results. Thus, NIR spectroscopy in conjunction with chemometrics, is a very useful and rapid technique for the discrimination of jujube fruit. 	jujube sugar
2	In vitro antimalarial activity of medicinal plant extracts against Plasmodium falciparum.Malaria is a major global public health problem, and the alarming spread of drug resistance and limited number of effective drugs now available underline how important it is to discover new antimalarial compounds. In the present study, ten plants were extracted with ethyl acetate and methanol and tested for their antimalarial activity against chloroquine (CQ)-sensitive (3D7) and CQ-resistant (Dd2 and INDO) strains of Plasmodium falciparum in culture using the fluorescence-based SYBR Green assay. Plant extracts showed moderate to good antiparasitic effects. Promising antiplasmodial activity was found in the extracts from two plants, Phyllanthus emblica leaf 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) 3D7: 7.25 mug/mL (ethyl acetate extract), 3.125 mug/mL (methanol extract), and Syzygium aromaticum flower bud, IC50 3D7:13 mug/mL, (ethyl acetate extract) and 6.25 mug/mL (methanol extract). Moderate activity (30-75 mug/mL) was found in the ethyl acetate and methanol extracts of Abrus precatorius (seed) and Gloriosa superba (leaf); leaf ethyl acetate extracts of Annona squamosa and flower of Musa paradisiaca. The above mentioned plant extracts were also found to be active against CQ-resistant strains (Dd2 and INDO). Cytotoxicity study with P. emblica leaf and S. aromaticum flower bud, extracts showed good therapeutic indices. These results demonstrate that leaf ethyl acetate and methanol extracts of P. emblica and flower bud extract of S. aromaticum may serve as antimalarial agents even in their crude form. The isolation of compounds from P. emblica and S. aromaticum seems to be of special interest for further antimalarial studies.	p. emblica Cytotoxicity
4	Inhibition of STAT3 signaling pathway by nitidine chloride suppressed the angiogenesis and growth of human gastric cancer.STAT3 has been strongly implicated in human malignancies, and constitutive activation of STAT3 serves a crucial role in cell survival, angiogenesis, immune evasion, and inflammation. In this study, we showed that nitidine chloride, a natural phytochemical alkaloid derived from Zanthoxylum nitidum (Roxb) DC, exerts potent anticancer activity through STAT3 signaling cascade. Nitidine chloride dose dependently suppressed VEGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tubular structure formation in vitro and dramatically reduced VEGF-triggered neovascularization in mouse cornea and Matrigel plugs in vivo. This angiogenesis inhibition mediated by nitidine chloride was well interpreted by the suppression of Janus kinase 2/STAT3 signaling and STAT3 DNA-binding activity in endothelial cells. Furthermore, nitidine chloride suppressed the constitutively activated STAT3 protein, its DNA-binding activity, and the expression of STAT3-dependent target genes, including cyclin D1, Bcl-xL, and VEGF in human gastric cancer cells. Consistent with the earlier findings, nitidine chloride inhibited gastric tumor cell growth and induced tumor cell apoptosis in vitro and effectively suppressed the volume, weight, and microvessel density of human SGC-7901 gastric solid tumors (n = 8) at a dosage of 7 mg/kg/d (intraperitoneal injection). Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis further revealed that the expression of STAT3, CD31, and VEGF protein in xenografts was remarkably decreased by the alkaloid. Taken together, we propose that nitidine chloride is a promising anticancer drug candidate as a potent STAT3 signaling inhibitor.	STAT3 gastric solid tumors
1	Chemical composition and antibacterial activity of the essential oil from green huajiao (Zanthoxylum schinifolium) against selected foodborne pathogens.Green huajiao, which is the ripe pericarp of the fruit of Zanthoxylum schinifolium Sieb. et Zucc, is widely consumed in Asia as a spice. In this work, the chemical composition of the essential oil from green huajiao was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) and GC/mass spectrometry (MS), and the majority of components were identified. Linalool (28.2%), limonene (13.2%), and sabinene (12.1%) were found to be the major components. The antibacterial activity, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the essential oil were evaluated against selected bacteria, including food-borne pathogens. The results showed that the sensitivities to the essential oil were different for different bacteria tested, and the susceptibility of Gram-positive bacteria tested was observed to be greater than that of Gram-negative bacteria. The antibacterial activity of the essential oil was particularly strong against Staphylococcus epidermidis , with MIC and MBC values of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/mL, respectively. A postcontact effect assay also confirmed the essential oil had a significant effect on the growth rate of surviving S. epidermidis . The antibacterial activity of the essential oil from green huajiao may be due to the increase in permeability of cell membranes, and the leakage of intracellular constituents, on the basis of the cell constituents' release assay and electron microscopy observations. 	zanthoxylum schinifolium sabinene
1	Antinociceptive Activity of Zanthoxylum piperitum DC. Essential Oil.Zanthoxylum piperitum DC. (ZP) is a traditional medicinal plant used mainly in countries from Asia such as Japan. This study aimed to investigate the antinociceptive effect of ZP essential oil (ZPEO). The major component present in the essential oil was beta-phellandrene (29.39%). Its antinociceptive activity was tested through animal models (formalin-, capsaicin-, and glutamate-induced paw licking and hot plate). The anti-inflammatory effect was evaluated through the carrageenan-induced leukocyte migration into the subcutaneous air pouch (SAP), with measurement of cytokines. The results showed antinociceptive effect for ZPEO for the first phase of the formalin-induced licking, glutamate, and hot plate tests. However, ZPEO had no effect on reducing paw licking induced by capsaicin. Finally, ZPEO had no effect against inflammation induced by carrageenan. 	zanthoxylum piperitum essential oil
1	[Studies on the chemical constituents from the peel of Zanthoxylum schinifolium Sieb et Zucc].Five compounds have been isolated from the Chinese traditional drug Qinghuajiao (Zanthoxylum schinifolium Sieb et Zucc). On the basis of UV, IR, 1HNMR, 13CNMR, 1H-1H COSY, 1H-13C COSY, NOESY and MS spectroscopic analysis, four of them have been identified as bergarpten (I), umbelliferone (II), skimmianine (III) and schinifoline (IV) respectively. The compounds II, III and IV were obtained for the first time from Zanthoxylum schinifolium, and the last one is a new compound.	zanthoxylum schinifolium umbelliferone
1	Acute demyelinating encephalitis due to Abrus precatorius poisoning--complete recovery after steroid therapy.INTRODUCTION: Poisoning from Abrus precatorius is attributed to a toxalbumin (abrin) that acts by inhibiting protein synthesis and rarely can cause immuno-mediated demyelination. We report a case of abrin poisoning with demyelination. CASE REPORT: A 19-year-old man presented with a history of ingesting crushed Abrus precatorius seeds following a family quarrel. He developed vomiting, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea, followed by a seizure and an altered sensorium. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed demyelination in the bilateral-medial temporal lobes. The patient was treated with supportive care, and intravenous methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisone, and recovered fully. DISCUSSION: Abrin is an immuno-modulator that may cause immune-mediated demyelination. We report the clinical course of a patient with demyelination after abrin poisoning, treated with corticosteroids, and document his clinical recovery. CONCLUSION: Demyelination is a rare complication of Abrus precatorius poisoning. In our case, the demyelination was demonstrated by MRI. Although our patient appeared to recover completely following methylprednisolone therapy, the suggestion that methylprednisolone or other corticosteroids might be useful in treating this demyelination needs experimental verification and clinical validation before concluding that it is a beneficial therapy.	abrus precatorius toxalbumin
1	Anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory properties of Zizyphus mauritiana root bark.An allergy may sometimes be very dangerous and one of the main factors responsible for allergy is the complement system which can lead to a life-threatening reaction called anaphylaxis. Cycloxygenase-1 (COX-1), Cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2) and 5-Lipoxygenase (5-LOX) trigger allergic and inflammatory reactions. A number of anti-allergic synthetic drugs are available but are costly and show many side effects. Hence, the ancient traditional system of medication mentioned in Ayurveda finds an edge over various synthetic drugs. Zizyphus mauritiana is referred to as the store house of phytochemicals in Ayurveda. The stem and root barks of Zizyphus mauritiana were dried and powdered under controlled conditions. Extractions of the dried powders were performed separately in different solvents in increasing order of their polarity and were tested for their ability to inhibit the complement system. The aqueous extract of the root bark was found to be more effective in inhibiting the complement system. Fractionation of the aqueous extract resulted in the isolation of the Most Active Fraction (MAF) which inhibited the complement system, COX-1, COX-2, and 5-LOX with IC50 values of 0.006 mug ml(-1), 0.065 mug ml(-1), 0.008 mug ml(-1), and 0.083 mug ml(-1), respectively. The MAF was proven to be successful in down-regulating pro-inflammatory mediators like TNF-alpha, COX-2, and iNOS when tested on a RAW 264.7 cell line. In vivo, the MAF was found to be preventive against anaphylactic shock and the Arthus reaction, when orally administered daily to Wistar rats. Phytochemical analysis of the MAF has indicated that it is rich in tannins. Results indicate that the MAF, a fraction isolated from the aqueous extract of the root bark of Zizyphus mauritiana, has potent anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory properties. 	zizyphus mauritiana allergy
1	Phytochemical and biological activities of four wild medicinal plants.The fruits of four wild plants, namely, Capparis decidua, Ficus carica, Syzygium cumini, and Ziziphus jujuba, are separately used as traditional dietary and remedial agents in remote areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. The results of our study on these four plants revealed that the examined fruits were a valuable source of nutraceuticals and exhibited good level of antimicrobial activity. The fruits of these four investigated plants are promising source of polyphenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, and saponins. These four plants' fruits are good sources of iron, zinc, copper, manganese, selenium, and chromium. It was also observed that these fruits are potential source of antioxidant agent and the possible reason could be that these samples had good amount of phytochemicals. Hence, the proper propagation, conservation, and chemical investigation are recommended so that these fruits should be incorporated for the eradication of food and health related problems. 	syzygium cumini saponins
1	Topical antiinflammatory activity of the major lipophilic constituents of the rhizome of Zingiber cassumunar. Part I: The essential oil.The essential oil of the rhizome of Zingiber cassumunar was found to exhibit a topical antiinflammatory effect, when tested using the model of carrageenan-induced hind paw edema in rats (ID(50) = 22 mg oil/paw). Individual assessment of topical antiinflammatory activity of the five major components of the oil demonstrated that (E)-1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)butadiene (DMPBD), terpinen-4-ol and alpha-terpinene significantly inhibited edema formation, whereas sabinene and gamma-terpinene were inactive up to 6 mg/paw. The most active compound, DMPBD, was found to be an antiinflammatory agent twice as potent as the reference drug diclofenac (ID(50) = 3 vs 6 mg/paw, respectively).	zingiber cassumunar essential oil
1	Miscellaneous terpenoid constituents of Abies nephrolepis and their moderate cytotoxic activities.Three monoterpenoids and two triterpenoids were isolated from Abies nephrolepis together with 53 known terpenoids. The structures of the compounds were established by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. The absolute configuration of 3-hydroxycamphane-2-carboxylic acid was established as (1S,2R,3S,4R) by Cu-Kalpha X-ray crystallography. All 58 isolates were tested for cytotoxic activity against four tumor cells viz. A549 (human lung adenocarcinoma), Colo205 (colon adenocarcinoma), QGY-7703 (human hepatoma) and THP-1 (human monocytic leukemia). alpha-Cadinol exhibited the best effects on A549, Colo205 and QGY-7703 with IC(50) values of 8.6, 8.1 and 4.6 mug/mL, respectively.	abies nephrolepis alpha-Cadinol
2	Antibacterial activity of extracts from some edible plants commonly consumed in Asia.Extracts of edible plants (26 species) from China, Japan, Thailand and Yemen were screened for their antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli and Salmonella infantis. Buffered methanol (80% methanol and 20% PBS) and acetone extracted inhibitory substances against tested bacteria from 16 plants, as revealed by the disc assay. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of extracts determined by the agar dilution method ranged from 165 to 2640 mg l(-1). The most sensitive microorganism to extracts from Azadirachta indica, Cinnamomum cassia, Rumex nervosus, Ruta graveolens, Thymus serpyllum and Zingiber officinale was B. cereus, with MIC of 165 to 660 mg l(-1). E. coli and S. infantis were only inhibited by Cinnamomum cassia extracts at the highest MIC (2640 mg l(-1)). L. monocytogenes (Tottori) was more resistant than the ATCC 7644 strain to extracts from Ruta chalepensis, Artemisia absinthium and Cissus spp. EDTA (0.85 mM) reduced the MICs of Cinnamomum cassia and Cissus rotundifolia by at least 50% when tested against E. coli, S. infantis, S. aureus and L. monocytogenes.	cinnamomum cassia antibacterial activity
1	Ailanthoidol suppresses lipopolysaccharide-stimulated inflammatory reactions in RAW264.7 cells and endotoxin shock in mice.The biological properties of ailanthoidol, a neolignan from Zanthoxylum ailanthoides or Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, which is used in Chinese traditional herbal medicine, have not been evaluated. Here, we report that ailanthoidol inhibits inflammatory reactions in macrophages and protects mice from endotoxin shock. Our in vitro experiments showed that ailanthoidol suppressed the generation of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E(2) , as well as the expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in RAW264.7 cells. Similarly, ailanthoidol inhibited the production of inflammatory cytokines induced by LPS in RAW264.7 cells, including interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6. In an animal model, ailanthoidol protected BALB/c mice from LPS-induced endotoxin shock, possibly through inhibition of the production of inflammatory cytokines and NO. Collectively, ailanthoidol inhibited the production of inflammatory mediators and may be a potential target for treatment of various inflammatory diseases.	zanthoxylum ailanthoides ailanthoidol
2	In vitro anti-Helicobacter pylori action of 30 Chinese herbal medicines used to treat ulcer diseases.Infection by Helicobacter pylori has been ascertained to be an important etiologic impetus leading usually to chronic active gastritis and gastric ulcer with growing incidences worldwide. Utilizing as the test pathogen a standard and five clinic strains of Helicobacter pylori, the antibacterial action was assessed in vitro with ethanol extracts of 30 Chinese herbal medicines which have been frequently prescribed since ancient times for treating gastritis-like disorders. Among the 30 tested materials, the ethanol extracts of Abrus cantoniensis (Fabaceae), Saussurea lappa (Asteraceae) and Eugenia caryophyllata (Myrtaceae) were strongly inhibitory to all test strains (MICs: approximately 40 microg/ml), and Hippophae rhamnoides (Elaeagnaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii (Liliaceae), Magnolia officinalis and Schisandra chinensis (Magnoliaceae), Corydalis yanhusuo (Papaveraceae), Citrus reticulata (Rutaceae), Bupleurum chinense and Ligusticum chuanxiong (Apiaceae) substantially active with MICs close to 60.0 microg/ml. As to antibacterial actions of the aqueous extracts of the same drugs, those derived from Cassia obtusifolia (Fabaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii and Eugenia caryophyllata were remarkably inhibitory against all the six Helicobacter pylori strains (MICs: approximately 60 microg/ml). The work compared almost quantitatively the magnitude of the anti-Helicobacter pylori actions of the 30 most prescribed gastritis-treating Chinese herbal drugs, and located as well some source plants where potent anti-Helicobacter pylori phytochemicals could be characterized.	citrus reticulata gastric ulcer
1	Delayed occurrence of H-ras12V-induced hepatocellular carcinoma with long-term treatment with cinnamaldehydes.Cinnamaldehyde from the bark of Cinnamomum cassia has been reported to have antitumor activity mediated by the inhibition of farnesyl transferase. We assessed in vivo the chemo-preventive effect of cinnamaldehydes on H-ras12V-induced hepatocellular carcinoma formation. A mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma was established by using the transgene of mutated H-ras12V under the regulation of albumin enhancer/promoter. When treated with cinnamaldehyde for 10 weeks, hepatic tumor development was delayed with 2'-benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde (BCA) compared with control hepatocellular carcinoma formation. The effect of 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (HCA) was comparable. The number of lesions and the size of each lesion were significantly reduced by BCA. Cell proliferation in the lesion was detected by incorporation of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU). BCA increased the number of splenocytes, concanavalin A-stimulated splenocyte proliferation and the infiltration of lymphocytes into liver. Data suggest that the delayed hepatic tumor development observed with BCA could be mediated by a long-term immunostimulating effect on T cells.	cinnamomum cassia BCA
1	Content variations of triterpenic acid, nucleoside, nucleobase, and sugar in jujube (Ziziphus jujuba) fruit during ripening.Jujube (Ziziphus jujuba) fruit is widely consumed as food and traditional Chinese medicine in Asian countries due to its potential effects for human health. To facilitate selection of the maturity stage providing optimum health benefits, jujube fruits were analysed at six stages of growth (S1-6) for triterpenic acids, nucleosides, nucleobases, and sugars by UHPLC-MS/MS or HPLC-ELSD methods. The content levels of most triterpenic acids and sugars increased with ripening, and reached the highest at S5 and S6, respectively. The accumulation of the cyclic nucleotides (cAMP and cGMP) was mainly in the later stage of ripening (S5-6). Therefore, if taking triterpenic acids as the major quality indicator, S5 should be the ideal time to harvest jujube fruit, and the full ripen stage (S6) maybe the best choice when taking sugars and cyclic nucleotides as the most important components. 	jujube nucleosides

According to the physicochemical properties and spectral analysis to elucidate the structures of the constitutes. RESULTS: Four compounds were isolated and identified as nitidine (I), sanguinarine (II), zanthobungeanine (III), dictamnine (IV). CONCLUSION: Besides dictamnine, three others are isolated from the rhizome of the plant for the first time.	zanthoxylum dissitum dictamnine
1	Isolation and characterization of four type 2 ribosome inactivating pulchellin isoforms from Abrus pulchellus seeds.Abrus pulchellus seeds contain at least seven closely related and highly toxic type 2 ribosome-inactivating pulchellins, each consisting of a toxic A-chain linked to a sugar binding B-chain. In the present study, four pulchellin isoforms (termed P I, P II, P III and P IV) were isolated by affinity, ion exchange and chromatofocusing chromatographies, and investigated with respect to toxicity and sugar binding specificity. Half maximal inhibitory concentration and median lethal dose values indicate that P I and P II have similar toxicities and that both are more toxic to cultured HeLa cells and mice than P III and P IV. Interestingly, the secondary structural characteristics and sugar binding properties of the respective pairs of isoforms correlate well with the two toxicity levels, in that P I/P II and P III/P IV form two specific subgroups. From the deduced amino acids sequences of the four isoforms, it is clear that the highest similarity within each subgroup is found to occur within domain 2 of the B-chains, suggesting that the disparity in toxicity levels might be attributed to subtle differences in B-chain-mediated cell surface interactions that precede and determine toxin uptake pathways.	abrus pulchellus toxicity

2	Review: Diverse pharmacological properties of Cinnamomum cassia: A review.Cinnamomum cassia is widely utilized as a spice in different cookeries worldwide, especially in Asian cuisines. This herb is also being used in different forms of traditional medicine (Unani, Ayurvedic, Japanese and Chinese) for managing conditions like dyspepsia, peptic ulcer disease and ischemic brain injury. Recent studies have shown the scientific evidence for the medicinal use of this particular herb in several diseases like H. pylori infection, diabetes, brain ischemia and cancers. This article reviews the literature on potential benefits of the herb published within the last 10 years. The authors used Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms "Cinnamomum" with "cassia" or "arromaticum" to filter the PubMed database. To date, no systemic review focusing on medicinal use of C. cassia was found in the literature. Various research articles elucidating diverse pharmacological properties of C. cassia were identified. The standardised extract of C. cassia or the active compounds extracted from the herb might prove to be a novel candidate for early prevention and complimentary management of conditions like diabetes mellitus or H. pylori-associated disorders. 	c. cassia ischemic brain injury
1	Fumigant toxicity of cassia and cinnamon oils and cinnamaldehyde and structurally related compounds to Dermanyssus gallinae (Acari: Dermanyssidae).The toxicity of two cassia oils, four cinnamon oils and (E)-cinnamaldehyde and (E)-cinnamic acid and 34 structurally related compounds to adult Dermanyssus gallinae (De Geer) collected from a poultry house was examined using a vapour-phase mortality bioassay. Results were compared with those of dichlorvos, a conventional acaricide. The cassia and cinnamon oils (cinnamon technical, cinnamon #500, cassia especial, cassia true, cinnamon bark and cinnamon green leaf) exhibited good fumigant toxicity (LD(50), 11.79-26.40 mug cm(-3)). alpha-Methyl-(E)-cinnamaldehyde (LD(50), 0.45 mug cm(-3)) and (E)-cinnamaldehyde (0.54 mug cm(-3)) were the most toxic compounds and the toxicity of these compounds was comparable to that of dichlorvos (0.30 mug cm(-3)). Potent fumigant toxicity was also observed in allyl cinnamate, ethyl-alpha-cyanocinnamate, (E)-2-methoxylcinnamic acid and (Z)-2-methoxylcinnamic acid (LD(50), 0.81-0.92 mug cm(-3)). Structure-activity relationships indicate that structural characteristics, such as types of functional groups and carbon skeleton rather than vapour pressure parameter, appear to play a role in determining toxicity. The essential oils and compounds described merit further study as potential acaricides for the control of D. gallinae populations as fumigants with contact action due to global efforts to reduce the level of highly toxic synthetic acaricides in the agricultural environment.	cinnamon (z)-2-methoxylcinnamic acid

CONCLUSION: GC-MS can be used to reflect the changes of volatile oil from different compatibility of Guizhi decoction, and the result will provide some evidence for the research of regular pattern of compatibility in Guizhi decoction.	cinnamomum cassia volatile oil
2	Quantitative and pattern recognition analyses of magnoflorine, spinosin, 6'''-feruloyl spinosin and jujuboside A by HPLC in Zizyphi Semen.Two rapid and simple HPLC methods with UV detector to determine three main compounds (magnoflorine, spinosin and 6'''-feruloyl spinosin) and evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD) to determine jujuboside A were developed for the chemical analyses of Zizyphi Semen. Magnoflorine, spinosin, and 6'''-feruloyl spinosin were separated with an YMC J'sphere ODS-H80 column (250 mm x 4.6 mm, 4 mum) by the gradient elution followed by the isocratic elution using methanol with 0.1 % formic acid and water with 0.1 % formic acid as the mobile phase. The flow rate was 1.0 mL/min. Jujuboside A was separated by HPLC-ELSD with YoungJinBioChrom Aegispak C18-L column (250 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 mum) column in a gradient elution using methanol with 0.1 % formic acid (A) and water with 0.1 % formic acid as the mobile phase. These two methods were fully validated with respect to linearity, precision, accuracy, stability, and robustness. These HPLC methods were applied successfully to quantify four compounds in a Zizyphi Semen extract. The HPLC analytical methods were validated for pattern recognition analysis by repeated analysis of 91 seed samples corresponding to 48 Zizyphus jujuba var. spinosa (J01-J48) and 43 Zizyphus mauritiana (M01-M43). The results indicate that these methods are suitable for a quality evaluation of Zizyphi Semen.	z. schinifolium tumor
2	Medicinal plants from nepal: evaluation as inhibitors of leukotriene biosynthesis.The methanolic extracts of 25 different Nepalese medicinal plants were tested for their activity to inhibit the biosynthesis of leukotriene B(4) in bovine polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The selected indigenous plants are used in traditional herb remedies to treat inflammatory diseases such as asthma, bronchitis, rheumatism, and skin disorders presumed to be mediated by leukotrienes. The leaves of Zanthoxylum nepalensis were shown to be the most potent inhibitor with an IC(50) value of 11 microgram/ml. The extracts obtained from Astercantha longifolia and Hedychium ellipticum also exhibited potent inhibitory action with IC(50) values of 20 and 22 microgram/ml, respectively.	hedychium ellipticum asthma
1	Simultaneous determination of three flavonoid C-glycosides in mice biosamples by HPLC-ESI-MS method after oral administration of Abrus mollis extract and its application to biodistribution studies.A simple HPLC-ESI-MS method was developed for the determination of vicenin-2 (1), isoschaftoside (2), and schaftoside (3) of Abrus mollis extract in mice plasma and tissues (heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys). The separation was achieved by HPLC on a Shim-Pack CLC-ODS column with a mobile phase composed of 0.1% formic acid (mobile phase A, 72%) and methanol-isopropanol (9:1) (mobile phase B, 28%). The electrospray source of the MS was operated in the selective ion monitoring (SIM) mode at m/z 593 ([M-H]-) for 1, and 563 ([M-H]-) for 2 and 3, respectively. The limit of detection (LOD) of 1-3 was in the range of 8.5-12.6 ng/mL for plasma, and 32.5-49.4 ng/g for tissue tested. The limit of quantification (LOQ) was found to be 25 ng/mL for plasma, and 100 ng/g for tissue. The calibration curves were linear in all matrices (r2 &gt; 0.994) in the concentration range of 25-500 ng/mL in plasma or 100-1250 ng/g in tissue, respectively. Intra-day and inter-day precision studies demonstrate that the method is precise with coefficients of variation intra-day and inter-day below 5.9 and 7.4% for all the samples, respectively. The recoveries of three flavonoid C-glycosides ranged from 95.3 to 106.4% for plasma, and 92.6 to 107.3% for tissues. Following oral administration of A. mollis extract to mice at a dose of 72 mg/kg, the concentrations of 1-3 in plasma and tissues were quantifiable in bio-samples collected up to 180 min. The method described is suitable for studies on the distribution of three flavonoid C-glycosides of A. mollis extract in plasma and different tissues of mice.	abrus mollis flavonoid c-glycosides
2	Anthelmintic screening of Zimbabwean plants traditionally used against schistosomiasis.Extracts of 23 plant species used popularly against schistosomiasis in Zimbabwe were screened for their anthelmintic effect. Schistosomules of the trematode Schistosoma mansoni and cysticercoids of the cestode Hymenolepis diminuta were studied in vitro. The material consisted of 58 plant extracts, of which 37 killed the newly excysted cysticercoids within an hour, when incubated in a culture medium. Lethal concentrations varied from 0.8 to 103 mg/ml. All plant extracts showed activity against the tapeworms after 24 h. Ten of the best extracts were also tested against schistosomules. Five of these extracts showed activity. Lethal concentrations varied from 0.6 to 33.8 mg/ml of dry plant material. Extracts of stem and root from Abrus precatorius (Fabaceae), of root bark and leaves from Ozoroa insignis (Anacardiaceae) and of root bark from Zizyphus mucronata (Rhamnaceae) gave the best results against tapeworms. The best results against schistosomules were obtained with stem and root extracts from Abrus precatorius (Fabaceae) and stem bark from Elephantorrhiza goetzei (Mimosaceae). Although the activity of root and root bark extracts commonly used in traditional medicine was verified in this study, our results showed that also extracts from leaf and stem can be effective anthelmintics.	abrus precatorius schistosomiasis
2	In vitro anti-Helicobacter pylori action of 30 Chinese herbal medicines used to treat ulcer diseases.Infection by Helicobacter pylori has been ascertained to be an important etiologic impetus leading usually to chronic active gastritis and gastric ulcer with growing incidences worldwide. Utilizing as the test pathogen a standard and five clinic strains of Helicobacter pylori, the antibacterial action was assessed in vitro with ethanol extracts of 30 Chinese herbal medicines which have been frequently prescribed since ancient times for treating gastritis-like disorders. Among the 30 tested materials, the ethanol extracts of Abrus cantoniensis (Fabaceae), Saussurea lappa (Asteraceae) and Eugenia caryophyllata (Myrtaceae) were strongly inhibitory to all test strains (MICs: approximately 40 microg/ml), and Hippophae rhamnoides (Elaeagnaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii (Liliaceae), Magnolia officinalis and Schisandra chinensis (Magnoliaceae), Corydalis yanhusuo (Papaveraceae), Citrus reticulata (Rutaceae), Bupleurum chinense and Ligusticum chuanxiong (Apiaceae) substantially active with MICs close to 60.0 microg/ml. As to antibacterial actions of the aqueous extracts of the same drugs, those derived from Cassia obtusifolia (Fabaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii and Eugenia caryophyllata were remarkably inhibitory against all the six Helicobacter pylori strains (MICs: approximately 60 microg/ml). The work compared almost quantitatively the magnitude of the anti-Helicobacter pylori actions of the 30 most prescribed gastritis-treating Chinese herbal drugs, and located as well some source plants where potent anti-Helicobacter pylori phytochemicals could be characterized.	ligusticum chuanxiong gastritis
2	Triterpenoids isolated from Zizyphus jujuba inhibit foam cell formation in macrophages.Because foam cell formation in macrophages is believed to play an essential role in the progression of early atherosclerotic lesions in vivo, prevention of foam cell formation is considered to be one of the major targets for the treatment of atherosclerosis. The present study examined the inhibitory effect of 50 crude plant extracts on foam cell formation. Among those crude extracts, Zizyphi Fructus (ZF) and Zizyphi Semen (ZS) extracts significantly inhibited the foam cell formation induced by acetylated LDL. Furthermore, triterpenoids such as oleanonic acid, pomolic acid, and pomonic acid were the major active compounds, and triterpenoids containing a carboxylic acid at C-28 play an important role in the inhibitory effect on foam cell formation in human macrophages. These data suggest that triterpenoids in Zizyphus jujuba , the plant source of ZF and ZS, may therefore be useful for the prevention of atherosclerosis.	zizyphus jujuba atherosclerosis
1	Acute demyelinating encephalitis after jequirity pea ingestion (Abrus precatorius).INTRODUCTION: Castor and jequirity beans are uncommon causes of poisoning. The more common but less severe castor poisoning is well described, but jequirity bean (Abrus Precatorius) poisoning is rare. The toxicity is attributed to toxalbumins (ricin and abrin) that act by inhibiting protein synthesis. Their use as agents of biological warfare, mechanisms of action, and clinical features of poisoning are summarized. CASE REPORT: A 30-year-old previously healthy female presented with bloody diarrhea and deep coma following ingestion of 3-4 seeds of a plant called 'ratti.' Investigations, including an MRI brain scan, showed evidence of acute demyelinating encephalitis. The patient died three days later due to progressive central nervous system depression. DISCUSSION: This is a previously unreported manifestation of jequirity bean poisoning. Demyelination is immune-mediated, and Abrus is a well-known immuno-modulator and stimulator. A possible immunological pathogenic mechanism is hypothesized.	abrus precatorius toxalbumins
4	Cinnamaldehyde affects the biological behavior of human colorectal cancer cells and induces apoptosis via inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.Cinnamaldehyde (CA) is a bioactive compound isolated from the stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia, that has been identified as an antiproliferative substance with pro-apoptotic effects on various cancer cell lines in vitro. In the present study, the effects of CA on human colon cancer cells were investigated at both the molecular and cellular levels. Three types of colorectal cancer cells at various stages of differentiation and invasive ability (SW480, HCT116 and LoVo) were treated with CA at final concentrations of 20, 40 and 80 microg/ml for 24 h. Compared with the control group, the proliferation inhibition rate of the human colorectal cancer cells following treatment with CA increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The invasion and adhesion abilities of the cells were significantly inhibited as indicated by Transwell and cell-matrix adhesion assays. Meanwhile, CA also upregulated the expression of E-cadherin and downregulated the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9. CA also elevated the apoptotic rate. The levels of pro-apoptotic genes were upregulated while the levels of apoptosis inhibitory genes were decreased which further confirmed the pro-apoptotic effect of CA. In order to explore the mechanism of CA-induced apoptosis, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) were used to regulate the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway. The transcription activity of PI3K/AKT was markedly inhibited by CA, as well as IGF-1 which functions as an anti-apoptotic factor. In conclusion, CA has the potential to be developed as a new antitumor drug. The mechanisms of action involve the regulation of expression of genes involved in apoptosis, invasion and adhesion via inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.	Akt colorectal cancer
1	Purification, structural characterization, and hypolipidemic effects of a neutral polysaccharide from Ziziphus Jujuba cv. Muzao.A neutral polysaccharide (PZMP1) with a molecular weight of 16.97 kDa was isolated from Ziziphus Jujuba cv. Muzao with water extraction, ethanol precipitation, and purification with DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow and Sephacryl S-300 column chromatography. PZMP1 was structurally characterized with high-performance gel-permeation chromatography, gas chromatography, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, methylation analysis, NMR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. The results show that PZMP1 is a homogeneous heteropolysaccharide composed of arabinose, galactose, glucose, mannose, and xylose in a molar percentage of 17.36: 3.29:2.68:1.05:1.00. The majorly backbone of PZMP1 is composed of 1,3,5-linked Araf, 1,3-linked Araf, 1,5-linked Araf, 1,4-linked Glcp, and 1-linked Araf, 1-linked Glcp. According to an NMR analysis, the repeating unit of PZMP1 is a linear backbone with branches at positions O-3, and O-5. PZMP1 also displays effective dose-dependent hypolipidemic activity, suggesting that it is a natural hypolipidemic agent, which could contribute to the functional food qualities of jujube fruit.	jujube glucose
3	Zantholic acid, a new monoterpenoid from Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides.From the extract of Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides fruits, a new menthane monoterpenoid, (4R,7R)-8-carboxy-7,9-dihydroxy-trans-menthane, tentatively, named as zantholic acid along with several known compounds was isolated. Its structure was determined using spectroscopic methods. The cytotoxic activity of zantholic acid against a panel of cancer cell lines was evaluated using the MTT assay. The results show that zantholic acid possesses a selective cytotoxic activity towards breast cancer cell lines. 	zantholic acid breast cancer
4	Development and characterization of immobilized cannabinoid receptor (CB1/CB2) open tubular column for on-line screening.Cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, are therapeutic targets in the treatment of anxiety, obesity, movement disorders, glaucoma, and pain. We have developed an on-line screening method for CB1 and CB2 ligands, where cellular membrane fragments of a chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line, KU-812, were immobilized onto the surface of an open tubular (OT) capillary to create a CB1/CB2-OT column. The binding activities of the immobilized CB1/CB2 receptors were established using frontal affinity chromatographic techniques. This is the first report that confirms the presence of functional CB1 and CB2 receptors on KU-812 cells. The data from this study confirm that the CB1/CB2-OT column can be used to determine the binding affinities (K(i) values) for a single compound and to screen individual compounds or a mixture of multiple compounds. The CB1/CB2-OT column was also used to screen a botanical matrix, Zanthoxylum clava-herculis, where preliminary results suggest the presence of a high-affinity phytocannabinoid.	CB2 pain
1	In Vitro Incorporation of Radioiodinated Eugenol on Adenocarcinoma Cell Lines (Caco2, MCF7, and PC3).Recently, the synthesis of radiolabeled plant origin compounds has been increased due to their high uptake on some cancer cell lines. Eugenol (EUG), a phenolic natural compound in the essential oils of different spices such as Syzygium aromaticum (clove), Pimenta racemosa (bay leaves), and Cinnamomum verum (cinnamon leaf), has been exploited for various medicinal applications. EUG has antiviral, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory functions and several anticancer properties. The objective of this article is to synthesize radioiodinated (131I) EUG and investigate its effect on Caco2, MCF7, and PC3 adenocarcinoma cell lines. It is observed that radioiodinated EUG would have potential on therapy and imaging due to its notable uptakes in studied cells.	cinnamon Eugenol
4	Inhibitory effect of Abrus abrin-derived peptide fraction against Dalton's lymphoma ascites model.Peptides derived from larger molecules that are important modulators in cancer regression are becoming leads for development of therapeutic drugs. It has been reported that Abrus abrin, isolated from the seeds of Abrus precatorius, showed in vitro and in vivo antitumor properties by the induction of apoptosis. The present study was designed to evaluate the in vivo therapeutic effectiveness of abrin-derived peptide (ABP) fraction in Dalton's lymphoma (DL) mice model. The lethal dose (LD(50)) of ABP was found to be 2.25 mg/kg body weight and further the acute toxicity was determined with sublethal doses in normal mice. The acute toxicity like body weight, peripheral blood cell count, lympho-hematological and biochemical parameters remained unaffected till 200 microg/kg body weight of ABP. The sublethal doses of ABP showed very significant growth inhibitory properties in vivo DL mice model. There were 24%, 70.8% and 89.7% reductions in DL cell survival in 25, 50 and 100 microg/kg body weight of ABP, respectively. Analysis of the growth inhibitory mechanism in DL cells revealed nuclear fragmentation, and condensation with the appearance of the sub-G(0)/G(1) peak is indicative of apoptosis. Further, the Western blotting showed that apoptosis was mediated by the reduction in the ratio of Bcl-2 and Bax protein expression, and activation of caspase-3 through the release of cytochrome c in DL cells. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed an effective antitumor response (104.6 increase in life span (ILS) %) with a dose of 100 microg/kg body weight.	Bax cancer
2	Phytochemical profiles and biological activity evaluation of Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim seed against asthma in murine models.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim seed (ZBMS) has been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) as an ingredient of polyherbal formulations for the treatment of inflammation and asthma. The aim of this study was to analyze the major composition and to evaluate the anti-asthma activity of ZBMS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Some murine models including acetylcholine/histamine-induced asthma, ovalbumin-induced airway inflammation, ear edema and toe swelling measurement, citric acid-induced cough, and anti-stress abilities were investigated to fully study the anti-asthma activity of ZBMS.GC chromatography was also performed to analyze the major fatty acid composition of ZBMS. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that the major fatty acid composition of ZBMS includes oleic acid (20.15%), linoleic acid (26.54%), and alpha-linolenic acid (30.57%), which was the leading component of ZBMS, and that the total fatty acid content of ZBMS was 77.27%. The murine models demonstrated that ZBMS displays a protective effect on guinea pig sensitization, a dose-dependent inhibition of the increases in RL and decreases in Cdyn, which resulted in the relief of auricle edema and toe swelling in mice and anti-stress activity. CONCLUSION: Our results validate the traditional use of ZBMS for the treatment of asthma and other inflammatory joint disorders, and suggest that ZBMS has potential as a new therapeutic agent for asthma management.	zanthoxylum bungeanum maxim asthma
2	Studies on the toxicity of an aqueous extract of the leaves of Abrus precatorius in rats.The toxic effects of an aqueous extract of Abrus precatorius were studied in 20 male white rats over a period of 18 days. The rats were divided into four groups of five rats per group. Those in Group A served as controls while the rats in Groups B, C and D were dosed per os with 400 mg/kg, 800 mg/kg and 1 600 mg/kg of the extract, respectively. Blood samples were collected for haematological and biochemical analysis and specimens of the liver, kidney and testes were taken for histopathological studies. The study showed that the extract of A. precatorius caused decreased levels of packed cell volume, haemoglobin concentration, red blood cell count, white blood cell count, mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular haemoglobin. The extract also resulted in increased levels of total serum protein, albumin, alanine amino transaminase, aspartate amino transferase, alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin. Histologically, testicular degeneration characterized by decreased numbers of lining cells of the epithelium as well as reduction in sperm cells with presence of scattered Sertoli cells were noted. The study thus showed that aqueous extract of Abrus precatorius is toxic and caution should be exercised in its use for medicinal purpose.	abrus precatorius toxicity
1	Identifying core features of adaptive metabolic mechanisms for chronic heat stress attenuation contributing to systems robustness.The contribution of metabolism to heat stress may play a significant role in defining robustness and recovery of systems; either by providing the energy and metabolites required for cellular homeostasis, or through the generation of protective osmolytes. However, the mechanisms by which heat stress attenuation could be adapted through metabolic processes as a stabilizing strategy against thermal stress are still largely unclear. We address this issue through metabolomic and transcriptomic profiles for populations along a thermal cline where two seagrass species, Zostera marina and Zostera noltii, were found in close proximity. Significant changes captured by these profile comparisons could be detected, with a larger response magnitude observed in northern populations to heat stress. Sucrose, fructose, and myo-inositol were identified to be the most responsive of the 29 analyzed organic metabolites. Many key enzymes in the Calvin cycle, glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathways also showed significant differential expression. The reported comparison suggests that adaptive mechanisms are involved through metabolic pathways to dampen the impacts of heat stress, and interactions between the metabolome and proteome should be further investigated in systems biology to understand robust design features against abiotic stress.	zostera noltii fructose
4	Abrus abrin derived peptides induce apoptosis by targeting mitochondria in HeLa cells.In our previous study, Abrus abrin derived peptide fraction (ABP) with molecular weight in range of 600-1500Da was shown to have potent antitumor activity in Dalton's lymphoma (DL) tumor bearing mice. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the mechanism of mitochondrial apoptosis induced by the peptide fraction. ABP was found to have selective antiproliferative activity (10ng-100ng/ml) on several tumor cell lines in vitro without having any cytotoxic effect on normal cell lines with a dose of 1000ng/ml. Analysis of the growth inhibitory mechanism in HeLa cells revealed DNA fragmentation with appearance of the sub G(0)/G(1) peak indicative of apoptosis. Further investigation results showed that the apoptotic machinery of HeLa induced by ABP was associated with the release of reactive oxygen species, a drop in mitochondrial transmembrane potential, upregulation of Bax, downregulation of Bcl-2, and activation of caspase-3. The peptide fraction was found to target mitochondria of HeLa cells as observed by confocal microscopy. This peptide fraction offers a source of mitochondria penetrating peptides which might have therapeutic induction of apoptosis in cancer cells.	Bax cancer
3	[Research progress on alkaloids constituents from Zanthoxylum and their pharmacological activities].There are 250 species of Zanthoxylum (Rutaceae) in the world.

1	Acid-catalyzed esterification of Zanthoxylum bungeanum seed oil with high free fatty acids for biodiesel production.A technique to produce biodiesel from crude Zanthoxylum bungeanum seed oil (ZSO) with high free fatty acids (FFA) was developed. The acid value of ZSO was reduced to 1.16mg KOH/g from 45.51mg KOH/g by only one-step acid-catalyzed esterification with methanol-to-oil molar ratio 24:1, H(2)SO(4) 2%, temperature 60 degrees C and reaction time 80min, which was selected as optimum for the acid-catalyzed esterification. During the acid-catalyzed esterification, FFA was converted into fatty acid methyl esters, which was confirmed by (1)H NMR spectrum. Compared with the other two-step pretreatment procedure, this one-step pretreatment can reduce the production cost of ZSO biodiesel. Alkaline-catalyzed transesterification converted the pretreated ZSO into ZSO biodiesel. The yield of ZSO biodiesel was above 98% determined by (1)H NMR spectrum. This study supports the use of crude ZSO as a viable and valuable raw feedstock for biodiesel production.	zanthoxylum bungeanum fatty acid methyl esters
1	Pharmacognostical and phytochemical evaluation of the leaves of Ziziphus xylopyrus (Retz) Willd.BACKGROUND: The fruit decoction of Ziziphus xylopyrus (Retz) Willd. is used toward increase sterility in woman intended birth control in some parts of Rajasthan, India. This plant is widely used in Turkish medicines as a potent sedative. One to two inches of the fresh stem bark of this species are chewed with 1-2 peppers, and the sap swallowed once a day for 5 days in the treatment of cough. Standardization is one of the challenges in herbal medicine. It is essential to evaluate the herbal plants scientifically and proper documentation should be made to know their medicinal properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Leaf samples of Z. xylopyrus were studied as recommended by World Health Organization for morphological, microscopic, physicochemical, phytochemical, powder characteristics and other methods for standardization. RESULTS: Morphologically the leaves are obovate or orbicular in shape, pinnate venation having aromatic odour and pungent taste. Microscopically leaves showed the presence of ground tissue, vascular strand, xylem and phloem. The crystals are mostly rosette type. Microscopic examination of powder showed the presence of stomata, covering trichomes, sclerenchyma, collenchyma, epidermal cells and vascular strands. Phytochemical screening of the plant part with various solvents revealed the presence of alkaloids, carbohydrates, steroids and sterol, glycosides, saponins, flavonoids, phenolic compounds, triterpenoids in it. Physicochemical parameters such as ash value extractive values were also determined and results showed that water soluble extractive value to be higher than alcohol soluble extractive value. CONCLUSION: Results may be helpful for further confirmation of selected species and in future these characters may be compared with the new batch of the same plant materials.	ziziphus xylopyrus sterol
1	Zizyphus jujuba and its active component jujuboside B inhibit platelet aggregation.The seeds of Zizyphus jujuba (SZJ), a famous oriental traditional medicine, have been reported to exhibit diverse activities in biological systems including the cardiovascular system. However, little information is available on its antiplatelet activity. This study was undertaken to investigate the antiplatelet effects of the ethanolic extract of SZJ (ESZJ) and of its principal components jujuboside A and B. In the in vitro platelet aggregation study, ESZJ exhibited significant and concentration-dependent inhibitory effects on collagen-, thrombin-, and AA-induced platelet aggregation. In addition, ESZJ-treated mice showed significantly the prolongation of bleeding times and the protection against thromboembolic attack. A comparison of the effects of jujuboside A and B on platelet aggregation revealed that only jujuboside B had potent inhibitory effects on collagen-, thrombin-, AA-, and ADP-induced aggregation. Jujuboside B also exhibited superior protection on thromboembolic model. Furthermore, jujuboside B had a significant inhibitory effect on collagen-induced thromboxane A2 production in rat platelets. This study describes the antiplatelet effects of ESZJ and of its active component jujuboside B, and its findings suggest that these agents be considered as components of preventive and therapeutic herbal drugs targeting cardiovascular diseases associated with platelet hyperaggregation.	zizyphus jujuba jujuboside b
3	Targets and Mechanism Used by Cinnamaldehyde, the Main Active Ingredient in Cinnamon, in the Treatment of Breast Cancer.Background: Breast cancer has become one of the most common malignant tumors in women owing to its increasing incidence each year. Clinical studies have shown that Cinnamomum cassia (L.) J. Presl (cinnamon) has a positive influence on the prevention and treatment of breast cancer. Aim: We aimed to screen the potential targets of cinnamon in the treatment of breast cancer through network pharmacology and explore its potential therapeutic mechanism through cell experiments. Methods: We used the TCMSP, TCM Database @ Taiwan, and TCMID websites and established the active ingredient and target database of cinnamon. Thereafter, we used the GeneCards and OMIM databases to establish a breast cancer-related target database, which matched the cinnamon target database. Based on the matching results, the STRING database was used to analyze the interaction between the targets, and the biological information annotation database was used to analyze the biological process of the target (gene ontology) and the pathway enrichment of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). After establishing the layout of the analysis, we used Cytoscape 3.6.0 software for network analysis. Finally, the cell experiment was used to verify the anti-breast cancer effect of cinnamaldehyde. Results: Our research showed that the main components of cinnamon, including cinnamaldehyde, can play a role in the treatment of breast cancer through 59 possible important targets. Subsequently, enrichment analysis by gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes showed that 83 cell biological processes and 37 pathways were associated with breast cancer (p < 0.05), including the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor and PI3K-Akt pathway, which are closely related to tumor cell apoptosis. In vitro cell verification experiments showed that cinnamaldehyde can significantly inhibit cell proliferation, change cell morphology, inhibit cell migration and invasion ability, and promote cell apoptosis. Conclusion: Our results showed that cinnamaldehyde is a potential novel drug for the treatment and prevention of breast cancer.	cinnamaldehyde breast cancer
1	Preparative isolation and purification of two phenylbutenoids from the rhizomes of Zingiber cassumunar by upright counter-current chromatography.Two phenylbutenoids, (E)-4-(3',4'-dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-enyl acetate and (E)-4-(3',4'-dimethoxyphenyl)but-1,3-diene, were separated from the rhizomes of Zingiber Cassumunar using a preparative upright counter-current chromatography (CCC). With a two-phase solvent system composed of light petroleum (b.p. 60-90 degrees C)-ethanol-diethyl ether-water (5:4:2:1, v/v), 150 mg of (E)-4-(3',4'-dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-enyl acetate and 175 mg of (E)-4-(3','-dimethoxyphenyl)but- 1,3-diene with the purity of 98.7 and 95.1%, respectively, were obtained from 600 mg of the crude sample of Z. Cassumunar in a single-step separation. Structures of these two compounds were identified by ESI-MS, 1H NMR and 13C NMR.	z. cassumunar phenylbutenoids
2	Cinnamomum cassia Prevents High-Fat Diet-Induced Obesity in Mice through the Increase of Muscle Energy.The cortex of Cinnamomum cassia Presl (Cinnamomi Cortex: CC) has commonly been used for weight control in traditional medicines, but without a scientific basis. Therefore, this study was undertaken to investigate the anti-obesity effect of CC extract in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mouse model and in C2C12 mouse skeletal muscle cells. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed a normal diet or a HFD for 16 consecutive weeks, and orally administered CC extract (100 or 300[Formula: see text]mg/kg) or metformin (250[Formula: see text]mg/kg; positive control) daily for 16 weeks. CC extract administration significantly decreased body weights, food intakes, and serum levels of glucose, insulin, total cholesterol and ALT levels, prevented oral glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, inhibited the protein expressions of MyHC and PGC1[Formula: see text] and the phosphorylation of AMPK, suppressed lipid accumulation in liver, decreased adipocyte size and increased muscle mass in obese mice. For this in vitro study, C2C12 myoblasts were differentiated into the myotubes for five days, and then treated with CC extract (0.1 or 0.2[Formula: see text]mg/ml) for 24[Formula: see text]h. CC extract significantly increased ATP levels by increasing the mRNA expressions of mitochondrial biogenesis-related factors, such as, PGC1[Formula: see text], NRF-1, and Tfam, and the phosphorylations of AMPK and ACC. Our results suggest CC extract controls weight gain in obese mice by inhibiting lipid accumulation and increasing energy expenditure, and that its action mechanism involves the up-regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle cells.	cinnamomum cassia muscle energy
1	Validation of a high-performance liquid chromatography method for the determination of (-)-alpha-bisabolol from particulate systems.A reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography method has been developed and validated for determination and quantitation of the natural sesquiterpene (-)-alpha-bisabolol. Furthermore the application of the method was done by characterization of chitosan milispheres and liposomes entrapping Zanthoxylum tingoassuiba essential oil, which contains appreciable amount of (-)-alpha-bisabolol. A reversed-phase C(18) column and gradient elution was used with the mobile phase composed of (A) acetonitrile-water-phosphoric acid (19:80:1) and (B) acetonitrile. The eluent was pumped at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min with UV detection at 200 nm. In the range 0.02-0.64 mg/mL the assay showed good linearity (R(2 )= 0.9999) and specificity for successful identification and quantitation of (-)-alpha-bisabolol in the essential oil without interfering peaks. The method also showed good reproducibility, demonstrating inter-day and intra-day precision based on relative standard deviation values (up to 3.03%), accuracy (mean recovery of 100.69% +/- 1.05%) and low values of detection and quantitation limits (0.0005 and 0.0016 mg/mL, respectively). The method was also robust for showing a recovery of 98.81% under a change of solvent in standard solutions. The suitability of the method was demonstrated by the successful determination of association efficiency of the (-)-alpha-bisabolol in chitosan milispheres and liposomes.	zanthoxylum tingoassuiba acetonitrile-water-phosphoric acid
2	Medicinal Plants Targeting Cardiovascular Diseases in View of Avicenna.BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a spectrum of diseases involving the heart and blood vessels, and the first cause of mortality worldwide. Medicinal plants have been used for thousands of years to treat CVD. In Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM), there is a special focus on heart diseases. Avicenna, a Persian physician of the eleventh century compiled a book devoted to this field named "The treatise on cardiac drugs" which is a compendium of TPM knowledge on CVD. Avicenna mentioned 50 cardiovascular active plants and described their therapeutic effects in the treatment of CVDs. METHODS: Here, we perform a detailed search in scientific databases to verify the cardiovascular activities of the medicinal plants suggested by Avicenna. Also, we discussed cardiovascular activities of a number of the most important suggested plants as well as their efficacy in clinical studies. Major bioactive compounds identified from these plants are also discussed. RESULTS: Pharmacological studies have revealed that the majority of these plants are effective in cardiovascular health with various mechanisms. Among them, Crocus sativus L., Cinnamomum cassia (L.) J. Presl, Punica granatum L., Ocimum basilicum L., Elettaria cardamomum (L.) Maton, Melissa officinalis L. and Phyllanthus emblica L. have proved to be more effective. CONCLUSION: The above-mentioned plants can be rich sources for developing new and effective pharmaceuticals for the treatment of CVDs.	phyllanthus emblica l cardiovascular disease
1	Fatty acids and carotenes in some ber (Ziziphus jujuba Mill) varieties.Several jujube varieties from the southeast of Spain were analyzed for fatty acid and carotene contents. Triglycerides having medium-chain fatty acids were most abundant in all samples. The main fatty acids were 12:0 (18.3 +/- 9.97), 10:0 (12.5 +/- 19.0), 18:2n6 (9.27 +/- 7.26), 16:1n7 (8.50 +/- 5.77), 16:0 (7.25 +/- 4.35), and 18:1n9 (5.34 +/- 2.52) on total saponifiable oil. The fruits yield 1.33 +/- 0.17 g/100 g saponifiable oil on a dry weight basis. Fatty acid profiles of fruits were found to be influenced by their developmental stage. Multivariable data analyses show that the samples could be grouped on the basis of their fatty acid content. Carotenes were found to be in good agreement with other fruits, varying from 4.12 to 5.98 mg/100 g on a dry weight basis. The contribution to vitamin value reach a mdium of 38 microg RE/100 g on a fresh weight basis.	jujube fatty acid
1	Phytochemical and biological activities of four wild medicinal plants.The fruits of four wild plants, namely, Capparis decidua, Ficus carica, Syzygium cumini, and Ziziphus jujuba, are separately used as traditional dietary and remedial agents in remote areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. The results of our study on these four plants revealed that the examined fruits were a valuable source of nutraceuticals and exhibited good level of antimicrobial activity. The fruits of these four investigated plants are promising source of polyphenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, and saponins. These four plants' fruits are good sources of iron, zinc, copper, manganese, selenium, and chromium. It was also observed that these fruits are potential source of antioxidant agent and the possible reason could be that these samples had good amount of phytochemicals. Hence, the proper propagation, conservation, and chemical investigation are recommended so that these fruits should be incorporated for the eradication of food and health related problems. 	ziziphus jujuba terpenoids
1	Essential Oils, Silver Nanoparticles and Propolis as Alternative Agents Against Fluconazole Resistant Candida albicans, Candida glabrata and Candida krusei Clinical Isolates.Development of effective and safe therapeutic treatment of fungal infections remains one of the major challenge for modern medicine. The aim of presented investigation was to analyze the in vitro antifungal activity of selected essential oils, ethanolic extracts of propolis and silver nanoparticles dropped on TiO2 against azole-resistant C. albicans (n = 20), C. glabrata (n = 14) and C. krusei (n = 10) clinical isolates. Among tested essential oils, the highest activity has definitely been found in the case of the oil isolated from the bark of Cinnamomum cassia, with MIC and MFC values for all tested strains in the range of 0.0006-0.0097 % (v/v) and 0.0012-0.019 % (v/v), respectively. High activity was also observed for the Lemon, Basil, Thyme, Geranium and Clove (from buds) essential oils. Significant differences in fungicidal activity have been observed in the case of four tested propolis samples. Only one of them revealed high activity, with MFC values in the range from 0.156 to 1.25 % (v/v). Satisfactory fungicidal activity, against C. albicans and C. glabrata isolates, was also observed in the case of silver nanoparticles, however C. krusei isolates were mostly resistant. We also revealed that constituents of most of essential oils and propolis as well as silver nanoparticles are not substrates for drug transporters, which belong to the most important factors affecting resistance of Candida spp. clinical isolates to many of conventional antimycotics. To conclude, the results of our investigation revealed that essential oils, propolis and silver nanoparticles represent high potential for controlling and prevention candidiasis.

1	Comparative analysis of chemical compositions and antimicrobial activities of essential oils from Abies holophylla and Abies koreana activities of essential oils from Abies holophylla and Abies koreana.The chemical compositions and antibacterial and antifungal activities of essential oils extracted from Abies holophylla and A. koreana were investigated. GC-MS analysis revealed that 38 compounds comprised 95.88% of the A. holophylla essential oil, with the main components being bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-ol (28.05%), delta3-carene (13.85%), alpha-pinene (11.68%), camphene (10.41%), dl-limonene (7.61%), beta-myrcene (7.11%), trans-caryophyllene (5.36%), and alpha- bisabolol (3.67%). In the essential oil from A. koreana, 36 compounds comprised 98.67% of the oil, and the main compounds were bornyl ester (41.79%), camphene (15.31%), alpha-pinene (11.19%), dl-limonene (8.58%), fenchyl acetate (5.55%), and alpha-terpinene (2.29%). Both essential oils showed great potential of antibacterial activity against several bacteria tested, in the range of 2.2-8.8 mug per disc by the agar disc diffusion method, and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 5.5-21.8 mg/ml by the microdilution method. Both oils showed very effective antifungal activities toward all pathogenic strains tested, including Candida glabrata, with MIC values in the range of 0.5-2.2 mg/ml. As a whole, A.koreanaoil showed better antibacterial and antifungal properties than A.holophylla oil.	a. holophylla alpha-terpinene
2	Efficacy of Cinnamomum cassia Blume. in age induced sexual dysfunction of rats.OBJECTIVE: Cinnamomum cassia has been suggested in Ayurveda for the management of sexual dysfunction. This research work was conducted to shed some light on the mechanism of action of the extract, and evaluate the efficacy of its methanol extract in age induced sexual dysfunction in male Wistar rats. Secondary objective of the project was to study the effect of treatment on sperm parameters and smooth muscle:collagen level in rat penile tissue. METHODS: Young and aged male rats were treated with methanol extract of Cinnamomum cassia at a dose of 100 mg/kg and sexual behavior was observed on 28th day in presence of female rats in estrous phase. Sildenafil was used as standard medicine. Effect of treatment was studied on epididymal sperm parameters, and Massons trichrome staining of rat penile tissues was performed to know the level of smooth muscle:collagen. RESULTS: The treatment significantly increased sexual function in aged rats that had decreased in comparison to young rats, but did not have any significant effect on sperm count, live and defective sperm percentage. However, treatment induced an increase in smooth muscle level and a decrease in collagen level in the aged rat penile tissue in comparison to that of age matched control. CONCLUSION: Based on our studies, we found that Cinnamomum cassia extract was effective in management of sexual dysfunction in aged rats and hence we propose a possible mechanism of action for Cinnamomum cassia which could be responsible for restoring sexual activity in aged rat.	cinnamomum cassia sexual dysfunction
1	High-performance liquid chromatography--two wavelength detection of triterpenoid acids from the fruits of Ziziphus jujuba containing various cultivars in different regions and classification using chemometric analysis.A simple and sensitive HPLC-DAD method has been developed for the first time to simultaneously determine 10 triterpenoid acids (ceanothic acid, alphitolic acid, zizyberanal acid, zizyberanalic acid, epiceanothic acid, ceanothenic acid, betulinic acid, oleanolic acid, ursonic acid and zizyberenalic acid) in the dried fruit of Ziziphus jujuba (called Dazao) which has been widely used as one of the traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs). This HPLC assay was performed on a reversed-phase C(18) column (250 mm x 4.6mm, 5 microm) with the column temperature at 35 degrees C. The mobile phase was composed of A (acetonitrile) and B (0.05% aqueous phosphoric acid, v/v). The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min and the detection wave length was set at 205 nm for reference compounds 1-9 and 238 nm for reference compound 10. All calibration curves showed good linear regression (r(2)&gt;0.9999) within the test range. The established method showed good precision and accuracy with overall intra-day and inter-day variations of 0.43-1.72% and 0.53-2.45%, respectively, and overall recoveries of 94.98-104.09% for the 10 compounds analyzed. The validated method was successfully applied for the simultaneous determination of the 10 triterpenoid acids in 42 batches of Dazao which contained 36 cultivars from 22 cultivation regions, and were investigated and authenticated as Z. jujuba. Hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) and principal components analysis (PCA) were performed to differentiate and classify the samples based on the contents of the 10 triterpenoid acids. The presented HPLC-DAD method conjugated with chemometrics approach was demonstrated to be very helpful in using Dazao resources, and was possibly useful in chemotaxonomic characterization.	z. jujuba ceanothenic acid
1	Total Phenolics and Total Flavonoids Contents and Hypnotic Effect in Mice of Ziziphus mauritiana Lam. Seed Extract.The seeds of Ziziphus mauritiana Lam. have been traditionally used for treatment of various complications including insomnia and anxiety. They are popularly used as sedative and hypnotic drugs in China, Korea, Myanmar, Vietnam, and other Asian countries. However, no scientific proof on hypnotic activity of Z. mauritiana seeds (ZMS) was reported. In this study, the hypnotic activity of 50% ethanolic extract from ZMS was observed on the loss of righting reflex in mice using pentobarbital-induced sleep mice method. The contents of total phenolics and total flavonoids in the extract were also determined. The results showed that the 50% ethanolic extract from ZMS contained total phenolics 27.62 +- 1.43 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g extract and total flavonoids 0.74 +- 0.03 mg quercetin equivalent (QE)/g extract. Oral administration of the extract at the dose of 200 mg/kg significantly increased the sleeping time in mice intraperitoneally administered with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg body weight). These results supported the traditional use of ZMS for the treatment of insomnia. The seeds of Z. mauritiana should be further developed as an alternative sedative and/or hypnotic product. 	z. mauritiana flavonoids
1	UHPLC-TOFMS coupled with chemometric method as a powerful technique for rapid exploring of differentiating components between two Ziziphus species.To rapidly explore the differentiating components and the potential chemical markers for discrimination between those Chinese medicinal herbs with similar chemical characteristics, an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-TOFMS coupled with multivariate statistical analysis method was proposed and validated by using two Ziziphus species (Z. jujuba and Z. jujuba var. spinosa) as the model herbs. After the samples were analyzed using UHPLC-TOFMS, the data sets of retention time (RT)-m/z pairs, ion intensities and sample codes were further processed with orthogonal partial least squared discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) to holistically compare the difference between the fruits of these two Ziziphus species, and to generate an S-plot. Those compounds correlating to the points at the two ends of "S" were regarded as the most differentiating components between these two kinds of samples. By comparing the mass/UV spectra and retention times with those of reference compounds, these components were finally characterized as zizyberenalic acid, palmitoleic acid, oleic acid, pomonic acid and rutin, and these compounds would be the potential chemical markers for discrimination of these jujube products. The results suggested that this newly established approach could be used to rapidly determine the subtle differences and explore the potential chemical markers for differentiation within the herbs with similar chemical ingredients.	jujube oleic acid
1	Natural formation of styrene by cinnamon mold flora.Tests on 106 dried pure cinnamon samples of diverse origins showed that some samples were naturally contaminated with high levels of styrene, up to 524 microg/g. Styrene taint can be associated with high water activity levels and thus with microorganism growth. The mold flora of a Korintji cinnamon sample in which styrene had been found at a 50 microg/g concentration was analyzed and 5 species of mold were isolated. An investigation into the ability of the 5 species of mold to produce styrene showed that 3 of them--namely, Penicillium citrinum, Penicillium oxalicum, Aspergillus niger--produced styrene in vitro in buffered peptone water at 25 degrees C within 5 d in the presence of several natural cinnamon volatile constituents containing the styrene structure. The conversion of these compounds into styrene by these 3 cinnamon fungal species has never been previously reported. A standardized inoculation with the 3 mold species was carried out on 10 g cinnamon samples of various origins followed by a 10-d incubation and highlighting styrene production except for Sri Lanka origin.	cinnamon styrene

1	Cinnamon and Chronic Diseases.Cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum and Cinnamon cassia), the eternal tree of tropical medicine, belongs to the Lauraceae family and is one of the most important spices used daily by people all over the world. It contains a lot of manganese, iron, dietary fiber, and calcium. Cinnamon contains derivatives, such as cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid, cinnamate, and numerous other components such as polyphenols and antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, anticancer effects. Several reports have dealt with the numerous properties of cinnamon in the forms of bark, essential oils, bark powder, and phenolic compounds, and each of these properties can play a key role in human health. Recently, many trials have explored the beneficial effects of cinnamon in Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, arthritis, and arteriosclerosis, but still we need further investigations to provide additional clinical evidence for this spice against cancer and inflammatory, cardioprotective, and neurological disorders.	cinnamon polyphenols
1	Analysis of volatile components, fatty acids, and phytosterols of Abies koreana growing in Poland.Extracts and essential oils from seeds as well as essential oils from cone scales and needles with twigs of the Abies koreana population were studied. An analysis of Korean fir essential oils allowed us to determine 147 volatile compounds. The identified compounds constituted 97-99% of the seed, cone and needle oils. The main volatile in the seed and needle oils was limonene (56.6% and 23.4%, respectively), while the predominant volatile in cone oils was alpha-pinene (51.2%). Korean fir seeds provided a rich source of both essential oil (3.8-8.5%) and extract, which was isolated with a 24.5% yield and contained numerous groups of fatty acids and phytosterols (414 microg/100g extract). The most prominent fatty acids were unsaturated, among which linoleic (41.2%) and oleic (31.2%) fatty acid were the main ones while the dominant sterols were isomers of ergostadienol and beta-sitosterol. A. koreana seeds, cones and needles are a source of many volatile bioactive compounds while the seed extract, with a pleasant scent, contained not only volatiles, but also fractions rich in fatty acids and phytosterols. These facts make A. koreana essential oils and especially the seed extract potential components of cosmetics.	a. koreana essential oils
2	In vitro anti-Helicobacter pylori action of 30 Chinese herbal medicines used to treat ulcer diseases.Infection by Helicobacter pylori has been ascertained to be an important etiologic impetus leading usually to chronic active gastritis and gastric ulcer with growing incidences worldwide. Utilizing as the test pathogen a standard and five clinic strains of Helicobacter pylori, the antibacterial action was assessed in vitro with ethanol extracts of 30 Chinese herbal medicines which have been frequently prescribed since ancient times for treating gastritis-like disorders. Among the 30 tested materials, the ethanol extracts of Abrus cantoniensis (Fabaceae), Saussurea lappa (Asteraceae) and Eugenia caryophyllata (Myrtaceae) were strongly inhibitory to all test strains (MICs: approximately 40 microg/ml), and Hippophae rhamnoides (Elaeagnaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii (Liliaceae), Magnolia officinalis and Schisandra chinensis (Magnoliaceae), Corydalis yanhusuo (Papaveraceae), Citrus reticulata (Rutaceae), Bupleurum chinense and Ligusticum chuanxiong (Apiaceae) substantially active with MICs close to 60.0 microg/ml. As to antibacterial actions of the aqueous extracts of the same drugs, those derived from Cassia obtusifolia (Fabaceae), Fritillaria thunbergii and Eugenia caryophyllata were remarkably inhibitory against all the six Helicobacter pylori strains (MICs: approximately 60 microg/ml). The work compared almost quantitatively the magnitude of the anti-Helicobacter pylori actions of the 30 most prescribed gastritis-treating Chinese herbal drugs, and located as well some source plants where potent anti-Helicobacter pylori phytochemicals could be characterized.	hippophae rhamnoides gastritis
1	Repellency of Cinnamomum cassia bark compounds and cream containing cassia oil to Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) under laboratory and indoor conditions.Patch and skin bioassays were used in laboratory and indoor tests to evaluate the repellency of (E)-cinnamaldehyde, identified in Cinnamomum cassia Blume bark and essential oil, and a cream containing 5% (w/w) cassia oil against Aedes aegypti (L.) females. Results were compared with those of a known C. cassia compound cinnamyl alcohol, N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) and two commercial repellents: MeiMei cream containing citronella and geranium oils and Repellan S aerosol containing 19% DEET. In patch bioassay tests with A. aegypti females, (E)-cinnamaldehyde at 0.153 mg cm(-2) and DEET at 0.051 mg cm(-2) provided 93 and 89% protection at 40 min after exposure. In skin bioassay tests, (E)-cinnamaldehyde at 0.051 mg cm(-2) and DEET at 0.025 mg cm(-2) provided 87 and 95% protection at 30 min after application. (E)-Cinnamaldehyde was significantly more effective than cinnamyl alcohol in both bioassays. In indoor tests with four human volunteers, 5% cassia oil cream provided 94, 83 and 61% protection against A. aegypti females exposed for 30, 50 and 70 min after application respectively. Cassia oil cream was a slightly less effective repellent than MeiMei cream. Repellan S aerosol provided 91% repellency at 120 min after application. Products containing cassia oil merit further study as potential repellents for the protection of humans and domestic animals from blood-feeding vectors and the diseases they transmit.	c. cassia cinnamyl alcohol
1	Apoptosis inducing activity of benzophenanthridine-type alkaloids and 2-arylbenzofuran neolignans in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells.Thirteen compounds belonging to different classes of alkaloids (1-9) and lignans (10-13), isolated from the methanol extract of roots of the African medicinal plant Zanthoxylum capense, were assayed for their ability as apoptosis inducers in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells. The cytotoxicity of these compounds was evaluated in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells by the MTS assay. Out of the tested compounds, three benzophenanthridine alkaloids (1, 4, and 7), a dibenzyl butyrolactone lignan (10), and two 2-arylbenzofuran neolignans (12 and 13) displayed significant cytotoxicity to HCT116 cells, confirmed by the Guava ViaCount viability assay. The selected compounds (1, 4, 7, 10, 12, and 13) were further tested for apoptosis induction activity in HCT116 cells, by evaluation of nuclear morphology following Hoechst staining, and by caspase-3 like activity assays. Morphologic evaluation of HCT116 nuclei following Hoechst staining and fluorescence microscopy revealed that compounds 1, 4, 7, 10, 12, and 13 induced apoptosis in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells, producing similar, or higher, apoptosis levels when compared with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), the cornerstone cytotoxic used in colon cancer treatment for several decades. In fact, HCT116 cells developed morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis, including chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation and formation of apoptotic bodies. Importantly, compounds 4 and 13 at 20 muM were the most promising in this study, inducing respectively ~11- and 7-fold increases in apoptotic cells as compared to vehicle control, whereas 5-FU increased apoptosis by ~2-fold. Apoptosis induction for compounds 4 and 13 was further confirmed by caspase-3-like activity assays, which showed respectively ~2- and 1.5-fold increases in caspase-3-like activity compared to vehicle control. These results suggested that specific benzophenanthridine alkaloids and 2-arylbenzofuran neolignans isolated from Zanthoxylum capense show strong anticancer activity in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells.	zanthoxylum capense alkaloids
4	PUMA dependent mitophagy by Abrus agglutinin contributes to apoptosis through ceramide generation.PUMA, a BH3-only pro-apoptotic Bcl2 family protein, is known to translocate from the cytosol into the mitochondria in order to induce apoptosis. Interestingly, the induction of PUMA by p53 plays a critical role in DNA damage-induced apoptosis. In this study, we reported mitophagy inducing potential of PUMA triggered by phytolectin Abrus agglutinin (AGG) in U87MG glioblastoma cells and established AGG-induced ceramide acts as the chief mediator of mitophagy dependent cell death through activation of both mitochondrial ROS as well as ER stress. Importantly, AGG upregulates PUMA expression in U87MG cells with the generation of dysfunctional mitochondria, with gain and loss of function of PUMA is shown to alter mitophagy induction. At the molecular level, our study identified that the LC3 interacting region (LIR) located at the C-terminal end of PUMA interacts with LC3 in order to stimulate mitophagy. In addition, AGG is also found to trigger ubiquitination of PUMA which in turn interacted with p62 for prompting mitophagy suggesting that AGG turns on PUMA-mediated mitophagy in U87MG cells in both p62-dependent as well as in p62-independent manner. Interestingly, AGG-triggered ceramide production through activation of ceramide synthase-1 leads to induction of ER stress and ROS accumulation to promote mitochondrial damage as well as mitophagy. Further, upon pre-treatment with Mdivi-1, DRP1 inhibitor, AGG exposure results in suppression of apoptosis in U87MG cells indicating AGG-induced mitophagy switches to apoptosis that can be exploited for better cancer therapeutics.	p62 glioblastoma
1	Antitrypanosomal potentials of the extract and fractions of Abrus precatorius seeds.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the in vivo trypanocidal activity of the methanol extract and fractions of Abrus precatorius seeds in mice. METHODS: Parasiteamia was induced unto mice by intraperitoneal injection of 1.25x10(5)Trypanosoma in normal saline. Five days when a high level of parasiteamia was established treatment commenced until ten days. The mice were treated with 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg bt. of the extract and 5 and 10 mg/kg bt. of the fraction (F(2)), respectively for 5 days. Diminazene aceturate at the dose of 3.5 mg/kg bt. for two days was used as the reference drug. The level of parasitaemia and packed cell volume (PCV) of the animals estimated. RESULTS: At doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg the crude extract showed a sharp reduction in the level of parasitaemia in mice compared with the untreated group. The mice treated with F(2) at doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg showed a sharp reduction in the level of parasitamia to zero in day 9, and a gradual recovery from the 12th day of treatment. This effect is comparable to that of the mice treated with 7 mg/kg of standard drug diminazene aceturate. The PCV of the treated showed a gradual decrease with time, but not as much as the untreated group. Phytochemical screening revealed the presence of glycosides, alkaloids, carbohydrates, tannins and proteins in the Abrus precatorius powder while F(2) was rich in alkaloids. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that both the extract and the fractions of Abrus precatorius seeds exhibited a promising trypanocidal property. Alkaloids may be responsible for the observed activity.	abrus precatorius Alkaloids
1	Purification, structural characterization, and hypolipidemic effects of a neutral polysaccharide from Ziziphus Jujuba cv. Muzao.A neutral polysaccharide (PZMP1) with a molecular weight of 16.97 kDa was isolated from Ziziphus Jujuba cv. Muzao with water extraction, ethanol precipitation, and purification with DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow and Sephacryl S-300 column chromatography. PZMP1 was structurally characterized with high-performance gel-permeation chromatography, gas chromatography, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, methylation analysis, NMR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. The results show that PZMP1 is a homogeneous heteropolysaccharide composed of arabinose, galactose, glucose, mannose, and xylose in a molar percentage of 17.36: 3.29:2.68:1.05:1.00. The majorly backbone of PZMP1 is composed of 1,3,5-linked Araf, 1,3-linked Araf, 1,5-linked Araf, 1,4-linked Glcp, and 1-linked Araf, 1-linked Glcp. According to an NMR analysis, the repeating unit of PZMP1 is a linear backbone with branches at positions O-3, and O-5. PZMP1 also displays effective dose-dependent hypolipidemic activity, suggesting that it is a natural hypolipidemic agent, which could contribute to the functional food qualities of jujube fruit.	jujube galactose
1	From Zinnia to Arabidopsis: approaching the involvement of peroxidases in lignification.Zinnia elegans constitutes one of the most useful model systems for studying xylem differentiation, which simultaneously involves secondary cell wall synthesis, cell wall lignification, and programmed cell death. Likewise, the in vitro culture system of Z. elegans has been the best characterized as the differentiation of mesophyll cells into tracheary elements allows study of the biochemistry and physiology of xylogenesis free from the complexity that heterogeneous plant tissues impose. Moreover, Z. elegans has emerged as an excellent plant model to study the involvement of peroxidases in cell wall lignification. This is due to the simplicity and duality of the lignification pattern shown by the stems and hypocotyls, and to the basic nature of the peroxidase isoenzyme. This protein is expressed not only in hypocotyls and stems but also in mesophyll cells transdifferentiating into tracheary elements. Therefore, not only does this peroxidase fulfil all the catalytic requirements to be involved in lignification overcoming all restrictions imposed by the polymerization step, but also its expression is inherent in lignification. In fact, its basic nature is not exceptional since basic peroxidases are differentially expressed during lignification in other model systems, showing unusual and unique biochemical properties such as oxidation of syringyl moieties. This review focuses on the experiments which led to a better understanding of the lignification process in Zinnia, starting with the basic knowledge about the lignin pattern in this plant, how lignification takes place, and how a sole basic peroxidase with unusual catalytic properties is involved and regulated by hormones, H2O2, and nitric oxide.

2	Antioxidant, antitumor and immunomodulatory activities of water-soluble polysaccharides in Abrus cantoniensis.Abrus cantoniensis is a vegetative food in tropical areas of Asia and claimed as folk beverages and soups consumed for cleansing liver toxicants and preventing liver diseases. Polysaccharides (ACP-I and ACP-II) were extracted with hot water from A. cantoniensis, and isolated by DEAE cellulose chromatography. The chemical properties as well as antioxidant, antitumor and immunomodulatory activities of ACP-I and ACP-II were investigated. The results showed that the ACP-I (9.09kDa) contained only glucose and ACP-II (38.45kDa) consisted of rhamnose, arabinose, galactose and glucose. ACP-II exhibited higher oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) and hydroxyl radical prevention capacity (HRPC) than ACP-I with ORAC values and HRPC values of 53.42+-3.32mumol Trolox equiv./g DW and 34.84+-5.07mumol Trolox equiv./g DW. Besides, in the wound healing assay, ACP-II exhibited potent migration inhibitory effects on MCF-7 cells. ACP-II could also significantly stimulate the proliferation of splenocytes and thymocytes, and enhanced NO production of peritoneal macrophages. These findings suggest that the polysaccharide ACP-II in A. cantoniensis could be served as a novel potential functional food. 	a. cantoniensis liver diseases
1	trans-Cinnamaldehyde Reverses Depressive-Like Behaviors in Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress Rats by Inhibiting NF-kappaB/NLRP3 Inflammasome Pathway.trans-Cinnamaldehyde (TCA) is the main active component extracted from Cinnamomum cassia (C. cassia), which has many pharmacological effects, such as anti-inflammation, lowering blood glucose, and improving nerve function. However, there is no report of TCA in the treatment of depression. The purpose of this study was to investigate the antidepressant-like effect of TCA and the mechanism of NF kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition by TCA. We divided 40 rats into the control group, CUMS group, FLU group, and the TCA group. The activation of the NF-kappaB pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of rats in each group was observed. After the treatments with FLU and TCA, the sucrose consumptions in rats increased significantly and the immobility time in forced swimming was decreased significantly compared to the CUMS group. The expression of TLR4, NF-kappaB-1, p-p65, TNF-alpha, NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, IL-1beta, and IL-18 proteins in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus was decreased, and the expression of IL-1beta, IL-18, and TNF-alpha in serum was downregulated compared to the CUMS group. Similar to FLU, TCA reverses the depression-like behaviors in rats, which indicates that TCA has a significant antidepressant-like effect. The mechanism of the antidepressant property of TCA might be that it inhibits the activation of the NF-kappaB pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of CUMS rats.	c. cassia TCA
1	Dihydrobenzo[c]phenanthridine alkaloids from stem bark of Zanthoxylum nitidum.Five novel alkaloids, zanthomuurolanine ( 1), epi-zanthomuurolanine ( 2), zanthocadinanines A ( 3) and B ( 4), and epi-zanthocadinanine B ( 5), composed of dihydrochelerythrine and a cadinane-type sesquiterpene linked by a methylene bridge, have been isolated from stem bark of Zanthoxylum nitidum. These structures were elucidated by spectroscopic techniques (UV, IR, MS, CD, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, DEPT, COSY, NOESY, HSQC, and HMBC analyses). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies confirmed the relative configurations of 1 and 4 and provided additional support for the structures of 2, 3, and 5.	zanthoxylum nitidum epi-zanthocadinanine b
